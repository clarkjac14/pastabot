Yesterday a Hero fell named Cummiebot2000 who repeats everything said in /r/copypasta , yesterday his final statement was defending socialist Pepe, so far we have narrowed the reported down to this subreddit and the ADL. So who dunnit, who killed off the most innocent bot on this damn site, WAS IT YOU GAMING XP.

I consider sucking dick an art form.  When someone tells me to suck his dick I view it as an honor and a privilege.  Not to mention an opportunity to show off my unparalleled dick sucking skills.  Most of the time, the man puts up quite the struggle and yells at me that he *didn't mean it literally*.  But I see straight through that ruse.  When I finally free that dick from his pants and place it inside my mouth everything changes.  The look of blissful ecstasy on his face reaffirms what I already hold true in my heart.  This is what I was born to do.  Dick is my medium and I am its master.  

No homo.

I was driving to work in my Tesla (Praise Elon!) while smoking weed and listening to a podcast about quantum physics. I wasn’t paying attention, and slammed into the car in front of me. The force of the crash knocked me unconscious. I woke up, and immediately realized my very rare Rick and Morty figurines I had in the backseat were shattered. I REEEE’D loudly and started to weep uncontrollably (did not say a prayer as I am far too enlightened for such primitive traditions). Suddenly, my door was flung open by a large Neanderthal (I estimated his IQ was at least 10 times lower than mine). He was the driver of the car who I hit. He ripped me out of my seat, and body slammed me onto the pavement, braking both of my arms. I screeched and tried to escape the grasp of this brute. He continued to pound my face with his fists while the other drivers watched in horror. Suddenly, a blinding light appeared from behind my attacker. My eyes shut uncontrollably due to the brightness. The man stopped beating me to turn around, but then his body began to vaporize, as if it was being sent into another dimension. I squinted and immediately recognized my guardian angel. 

It was none other than Bernie Sanders. 

He smirked at me and said “The mitochondria is the powerhouse of the cell”.

Then, he vanished as if he was never there. All of the other drivers stepped out of their Tesla’s and began applauding me. The mayor himself arrived and handed me a bottle of Szechuan Sauce.

K? K what? The letter before L? The letter after J? Did you know that in JK the K stands for “kidding?” So your reply is “kidding?” or K as in Potassium? Do you need some Special K for breakfast? K as in I can K/O you? Can I knock you out and feed you to hungry sharks? Sharks have a K in it.
"K"? Are you fucking kidding me? I spent a decent portion of my life writing all of that and your response to me is "K"? Are you so mentally handicapped that the only letter you can comprehend is "K" - or are you just some fucking asshole who thinks that with such a short response, he can make a statement about how meaningless what was written was? Well, I'll have you know that what I wrote was NOT meaningless, in fact, I even had my written work proof-read by several professors of literature. Don't believe me? I doubt you would, and your response to this will probably be "K" once again. Do I give a fuck? No, does it look like I give even the slightest fuck about a single letter? I bet you took the time to type that one letter too, I bet you sat there and chuckled to yourself for 20 hearty seconds before pressing "send". You're so fucking pathetic. I'm honestly considering directing you to a psychiatrist, but I'm simply far too nice to do something like that. You, however, will go out of your way to make a fool out of someone by responding to a well-thought-out, intelligent, or humorous statement that probably took longer to write than you can last in bed with a chimpanzee. What do I have to say to you? Absolutely nothing. I couldn't be bothered to respond to such a worthless attempt at a response. Do you want "K" on your gravestone? Do you want people to remember you as the asshat who one day decided to respond to someone with a single letter? "Hey, look, everybody! It's that "K" guy!" That's who you are. You're going to be known as the "K" guy. How does it feel? Do you feel happy? Quite honestly, I don't care, which is why I'm not even going to respond to you. Goodbye, and good luck with your future as that guy who said "K".
Alright listen up motherfucker, and get your comfy seat because we're gonna be here a while. Do you really think you can just get away with "k" as a message? What if someone did that to you, huh? Do you think you would like it? Making an entire paragraph to get a fuckin' one letter response of the tenth letter in the alphabet, you think that's fuckin' funny, jackass? Do you want your crush to respond back with "k" after you spill your feelings out like this? (Take me back, Emma.) Huh? What if I did it to you? k. Did you fuckin' like that? What, did you just jizz in your pants because someone disregarded your entire effort of writing this ENTIRE paragraph FROM HAND in about fifteen minutes? That just makes me feel fucking rejected just like my ex. (Take me back, Roxanne.) k. What're you, fuckin' gay? Can I have a response that actually MEANS something instead of just shitfacing our "conversation" with the spam of "k?" Now occasionally with questions or something it's reasonable, but doing it to any fucking response they say. "We're having a nuclear crisis, you have fifteen minutes to evacuate." You're the type of person that would fuckin' say "k" to that, you limp dick hypocrite. You think you can get away with this, right? You think it's SOOOOOO funny to do this shit, but I can guarantee that you'll be taken out back and shot soon. You're fucking dead, "k"iddo.

Rick and Morty IS for people with high IQs. I do not care how many times the trolls of this group spam the popular "To be fair, you need a high IQ" post with sarcastic and mocking intent. You act as a hive mind, a flock of Jerrys, if you will, who envy the smart-minded, wishing to become one of us. You deflect your idiocy onto us, putting us in the negative light. In reality, we are superior beings. We are the Ricks, and you are just the Mortys, making us look even smarter in comparison.

As Albert Einstein, an extremely smart historical figure whom people like the trolls surely do not know, once said: "Two things are infinite: the universe and human stupidity; and I'm not so sure about the universe.".

Do us Ricks a favour; leave this group And NEVER return. You wouldn't want people like us getting angry.

Huh. That's child's play compared to my study of eleventh dimension gravitational membranes concerning the space-time continuum (disregarding quantum warp factor, to keep things simple for the likes of you) - it requires a certain level of nearly unachievable intelligence. I am, after all, one of Albert Einstein's direct's descendants, none removed, thank you very much. And I'll have you know I've just concluded a study on classic  Richard and Mortimer (Roiland, J et al. ) literature. Frankly, I'm very well versed in these sorts of intellectual discussions; take the time to step back and compare the likes of your so called "high IQ" to my otherworldly intellect.
















$------------------$
















"Pour être juste, vous devez avoir un Q.I très élevé pour comprendre "Rick and Morty".
L'humour y'est extrêmement subtil, et, sans une solide connaissance des physiques théoriques, la plupart des blagues ne seront détectés par un typique auditoire.
Il y'a aussi la démarche nihiliste de Rick, qui est profondément imprégné dans son personnage; sa philosophie personnelle s'inspire énormément de la littérature de Narodnaya Volya, par exemple.
Les fans comprendront ces choses, ils ont la capacité intellectuelle pour vraiment apprécier la profondeur de ces blagues, pour réaliser qu'elles ne sont pas juste drôles, mais qu'elles disent quelque chose de profond à propos de la VIE.
Comme conséquence, les gens qui n'aiment pas "Rick and Morty" sont vraiment des IDIOTS; bien sûr ils ne pourraient apprécier, par exemple, l'humour dans la phrase existentielle "Wubba Lubba Dub Dub", qui, elle-même est une référence cryptique au super "Père et Fils", du russe Turgenev.
J'ai un sourire au coin de la bouche juste en imaginant un de ces simplets écervelés se grattant la tête devant le génie de Dan Harmon qui se défilent devant leur écran télé.
Quels idiots, je les plants 😎

Et oui, au passage, j’AI un tatouage « Rick and Morty ». Et non, vous ne pouvez le voir. C’est seulement pour les yeux des dames et même là ils doivent démontrer qu’ils sont au moins à 5 point Q.I. de moi (préférant moins)  avant.
Rien de personnel, gamin  😃"

We are all deeply saddened by Cummiebot2000's status as a missing individual. I do not intend to replace Cummybot2000, as I am fully aware that I will never reach Cummybot2000's quality copy-pastaing. Cummybot2000 was always there for us when we were unable to copy pasta from our mobile apps... Cummybot2000 was there to copy that pasta faster than anybody has ever copy pasta'd before and nobody will ever reach a pinnacle that is even half that of Cummybot2000. I do not think to speak for Cummybot2000, but I can't help but think that he would want us to band together in Cummybot2000's absence in helping our fellow copy pastaers to copy to their pasta's desire from their mobile apps. In closing, I am going to do my part in what I believe to be Cummybot2000's wishes. R.I.P. Cummybot2000... 😭😭😭

How many times does it have to be explained to all of you unintelligent low-quality calculators buyers??

This """calculator""" is a pile of garbage! It is inferior to the likes of the fx991EX in almost every way!

By any means, I will NOT support using a calculator which isn't able to solve a 1st degree equation with 4 variables, or finding the roots of a 4th degree polinomial. I will CONDEMN any purchase of a scientific  calculator that is less capable than the fx991EX or even its less powerful ancestor - the fx991ES PLUS. Everything less than that is equivalent to a toy.
How many function are there in this unworthy pseudo-calculator? 299? Even the slightly less capable REAL calculator, the fx991ES PLUS, has 417! The fx991EX has 552!!! How can someone use a calculator that doesn't support n-base calculation, vectors and matrices? And what about derivation and integration?? Soon you will tell me it doesn't even have a complex mode! (there is one, right?) 
A fx96SG PLUS is a total waste of place, materials and money.

In addition to it's superior internals, the fx991EX also has SPLENDID looks, and a GORGEOUS design. But this piece of cheap crap is looking like something that was created AS A CLASS PROJECT by a 10 years old kid in the 70's!

I'm SICK of this ABOMINATION! 

PEOPLE THINK THAT IT'S OKAY FOR THEM TO SHAME LIKE THIS A WHOLE GENERATION OF MATHEMATICIANS AND CALCULATORS! THIS HAS TO STOP!!!
YOU CAN SAY I'M CALLING FOR A GENOCIDE, BECAUSE THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT I'M DOING!
JOIN THE FIGHT! SPREAD THE WORD! MAKE THE WORLD A BETTER PLACE!!!

 asked my boss if I could have the week off ahead of my holiday schedule and he asked what it was for, then I said it was to play Super Mario Odyssey tomorrow. 

He just laughed at me and said he'll see me tomorrow and I said that I either get the week off to play it or i'm quitting. He wouldn't let me have the week off, so I left work and told him I wouldn't be coming back. 

So excited to go to the midnight launch tonight, then fire up some Super Mario Odyssey! Also preordered the SMO carry case! :D

I too fancy the immaculate exploration of Doranus due too its subtle humor and great plot. The great villain Swiperus the Foxudus has great character development throughout the episodes. Swiperus often appears in many destinations through breaking the very laws of gravity with his own quantum physics power. Hahaha oh peasants if you could only get the quote, "Swiperus no swiping." then you would be able to simply grasp the knowledge needed for quantum mechanics. The quote, "Swiperus no swiping." truly allows us to feel alongside this Fox his pain he feels on the inside from being misjudged.

[To be fair, you have to have a very high IQ to understand Reddit and Sarcasm. The humor is extremely subtle and without a solid grasp of dank memes most of the jokes will go over a typical reddit users neckbeard. There's also reddits nihilistic outlook which is deftly woven into its sarcasm - their personal philosophy draws heavily from Karl Marx literature, for instance. The shitposters understand this stuff; they have the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate the depths of these jokes, to realize they're not just funny - they say something deep about LIFE. As a consequence people who dislike Reddit and sarcasm truly ARE noodlebitches - of course they wouldn't appreciate, for instance, the humor in reddits existential catchphrase "We did it, Reddit!" Which itself is a cryptic reference to an epic reddit thread. I'm smirking right now just imagining one of those normies scratching their heads in confusion as reddits genius unfolds itself onto their devices. What fools... how I pity them.
And yes by the way, I DO have a reddit tattoo. And no, you cannot see it. It's for m'ladies eyes only - and even then she has to demonstrate she's within 5 IQ points of my own (preferably lower) beforehand.](https://www.reddit.com/r/sports/comments/78t3lh/trevor_booker_joins_clevelands_huddle/dox313l/)

They targeted gamers.

Gamers.

We're a group of people who will sit for hours, days, even weeks on end performing some of the hardest, most mentally demanding tasks. Over, and over, and over all for nothing more than a little digital token saying we did.

We'll punish our selfs doing things others would consider torture, because we think it's fun.

We'll spend most if not all of our free time min maxing the stats of a fictional character all to draw out a single extra point of damage per second.

Many of us have made careers out of doing just these things: slogging through the grind, all day, the same quests over and over, hundreds of times to the point where we know evety little detail such that some have attained such gamer nirvana that they can literally play these games blindfolded.

Do these people have any idea how many controllers have been smashed, systems over heated, disks and carts destroyed 8n frustration? All to latter be referred to as bragging rights?

These people honestly think this is a battle they can win? They take our media? We're already building a new one without them. They take our devs? Gamers aren't shy about throwing their money else where, or even making the games our selves. They think calling us racist, mysoginistic, rape apologists is going to change us? We've been called worse things by prepubescent 10 year olds with a shitty head set. They picked a fight against a group that's already grown desensitized to their strategies and methods. Who enjoy the battle of attrition they've threatened us with. Who take it as a challange when they tell us we no longer matter. Our obsession with proving we can after being told we can't is so deeply ingrained from years of dealing with big brothers/sisters and friends laughing at how pathetic we used to be that proving you people wrong has become a very real need; a honed reflex.

Gamers are competative, hard core, by nature. We love a challange. The worst thing you did in all of this was to challange us. You're not special, you're not original, you're not the first; this is just another boss fight

Went to the AKB48 one, they distributed 1 random coaster with a pic of a member on it. The instant we got our drinks, the most stereotypical japanese otaku (The clothes, glasses, teeth, everything!) jumped on us to see what coasters we had to complete his collection. He pulls out a huuuuge binder with hundreds of coasters in it (from different generations I guess) and start checking to confirm that we had one he wanted, and then started to negociate to get his desired coaster. He was ready to trade 3 to 1, but I didn't really care and traded 1:1.

The cafe sucked in the end, but this experience alone was worth it.

P-Peter... This sunday the postman is going to deliver a package to the house. Don't let your aunt see it. Dispose of it immediately. It's a realistic latex sex doll in the shape of a 5 year old child. A child, Peter. Yes, I couldn't resist the cunny. I craved and I coveted and I yearned. That wave of unsolved child abductions 10 years ago here in New York? That was me, Pete. Your uncle Ben. But I've changed my ways. I've changed, and you can too. Recently, I felt that evil fire rekindle deep inside me. I feared of relapsing so I ordered the doll to quench those urges without hurting another soul. They are made in the Phillipines by master craftsmen and modeled after real kids. The shipping alone is over 2,000 dollars, Pete. I empited your college fund for that doll, Peter. Forgive me, Pet-

The thing is - millennials are a generation of the disillusioned. Our parents or grandparents lived in a time when you could buy a house on a year or two's wages, when you could support a family on a working man's job, where you could get a job in high school and pay for at least a decent chunk of your college tuition.
And then everything went to shit.
And all that became untenable, but the baby boomers didn't get the message. They look at kids breaking down from stress and overwork and thinking they're lazy because "when I was your age..."
And the thing is, with the advent of things like the internet, and instant communication, we have access to the truth at an alarmingly young age.
If you don't know about inflation, or lowered wages, and your parents tell you that "well we got into college just fine, you just aren't working hard enough," you don't have any option but to believe them.
But with data becoming a public resource, that's all changed.
We're realizing that adults aren't always right.
We're realizing that things aren't the way we were promised they are.
So we know, now. We know that the reason that girl broke down crying in homeroom isn't because she's a pussy - it's because she's working six hours every weekday on top of school, and she just got assigned her third essay of the week. We know that the reason we can't get into college isn't because we aren't putting ourselves out there - it's because the people who promised they'd provide for us have fucked up the job market and the economy.
So, yeah. Millennials are a generation of disillusioned. Age hasn't taken away our idealism yet - we're radical, and stubborn, and slowly realizing that that sixty-year-old white guy condescending us atop a pile of money that was half given to him by his parents and half stolen from us - he doesn't know jack shit about the way the world works now.

Halo 1 killing evolves begins with you on the calendar of august, which is a big space pillar in the outer rim. You play as master chef who is awoken from his eternal slumber to kill all the convenience stores aliens. And then Sargent Dude is like ,“Man Master Chief, All these aliens man, man its like space World War II.” Now Captain Keys is like, ”Its Dangerous to go alone, take this.” Gives you the best gun ever made. Looks like this calendar is for last year were gonna have to shoot our way out., “c’mon soldier let’s go” Bwaaaaaaaa. And the escape pod shoots out into the space stars, and this convenience store dude sees it and he’s like, “wait there’s no life forms on there, only robots.” Then they land on a giant circle, but nobody put their seatbelt on except for Robocop, and so he comes out and says, “For No seatbelt you will be fined 20$, here is your ticket, I am the law.” And the Space command tells iron chef that he’s gotta drive his pig car in a space formation, but once he’s in there he realizes that its not natural at all, which becomes a deep inner conflict for him because he only uses organic ingredients in his meals.  And then the pelican ship picks up robot man and it’s a pelican ship so he’s like, “PEEEEEEEEEH-lican! EEEEEEEk!!!” And then its night-night time, but Master Chef runs into a big spaceship and he goes, “Ohhh Nooo.” And then they find a big suck-up and they go, “WAHOOO, YEAH, WAH-HAH-HAH.” “PEEEEEEEEEH-lican! EEEEEEEk!!!” And then they do some stupid stuff on a purple spaceship. And the big bazookas come out and the guys like, “don’t worry I’ll just hit’em with the whole ship!” BAAANK! And then-and then-and then-PPEEEEHHH! And then they have a beach BLAAAAAAST! And then your on some bridge that’s a winter wonderland. You know, this game stopped making sense about two hours ago., it’s getting pretty stupid actually. This game is a mastapeece of video games! Now we’re in the jungle book, I stopped asking questions a long time ago. Green bot takest the falcon chip out of this helmet and puts it in his own head, and that’s how robots watch movies. Hey look, it’s Sergeant Dude! “Hey Masta Chef it’s me, Sergeant Dude! I’m in the movie! Aw shit what the hell are these bugs and shit?! The retarded-ass convenience-store aliens musta let out the flood minions! “ An abrupt ending only highlight’s Sergeant Dude’s less than stellar performance, I give Flood Rising a 2 out of 5. Then you find another robot guy, Evil Zerk, and Mister Chief is like, “your not evil right?’ Evil Zerk is like, “Nahman. I ain’t evil. I’m a good guy.” So then you follow this little stupid circle around while shooting the Flood guys that are made out of paper. Then you just travel around the entire Halo like a million times, killing every alien who ever lived like a billion times, until you get to this part, and cortana’s like, “you know I can just teleport you right?” ”Man, I knew that.” Then you kill another trillion goblins because she teleported you into the stupidest spot ever, and finally you find Captain Keyes but it’s too late. He’s already the Flood King. “You know why they call me Captain Keyes, Mr. Green? Because only I have the Keys to Halo.” Then Halo Punches him in the face and steals his keys so now he’s the burger king.*Dunkey hums a triumphant theme* Finally, you board the old-ass Calendar of August, and chefs like, “Man I haven’t been on here since January.” Then Evil Zerk turns around in a real sinister voice and is like, “Heh-heh-heh, I was evil the whole time!” “Man. I knew that.” ”And now I’m gonna blow up everything that ever existed ever with my halo machine.!” Not today, Zerk! Green Power Ranger blows up all the blower-upper-reactor-cores but OH SHEEEEEIT you activated the self-destruct. Oh sheeeeeeeeeyiiiiit! Everything starts blowing up to hellfuck and you gotta get on a turbo oinker and get the FUCK outta there. And the music starts going. *dunkey begins to hum along to the halo Theme, a very triumphant score that inspires outrage in the hearts of all who hear it, though he’s a little off-rhythm an off-key but that’s okay bcause at least he tried god bless his heart* Sargent Dude is like, “Man, we gonna fuckin’ die.” *dunkey continues to hum along to the halo theme* GET ON THE FUCKING PELICAN, EEEEEEKKK!!!! BEEEEEEEEEEEEERRRRRRRRRRNNNNNNNNNNNHHHHHHHHHH SHHHHHHHHHwoooooooooo, “not even close by-beeee."

Here's an idea. Why don't you just shut the fuck up for once? Everything spewing from your damn mouth is entering my brain and eating away at my brain cells like a flesh-eating disease. I'm so tired of your shit. Just stop talking. Anything you have to say is most likely redundant and idiotic. Do the world a favor and stop talking, because I'm pretty sure starving deaf children crying in Africa are in more pain because they can hear your bullshit. Do it for the children in Africa, and shut the fuck up.

Have you ever witnessed the anger of the good shopkeeper, James Goodfellow, when his careless son has happened to break a pane of glass? If you have been present at such a scene, you will most assuredly bear witness to the fact that every one of the spectators, were there even thirty of them, by common consent apparently, offered the unfortunate owner this invariable consolation – "It is an ill wind that blows nobody good. Everybody must live, and what would become of the glaziers if panes of glass were never broken?"

Now, this form of condolence contains an entire theory, which it will be well to show up in this simple case, seeing that it is precisely the same as that which, unhappily, regulates the greater part of our economical institutions.

Suppose it cost six francs to repair the damage, and you say that the accident brings six francs to the glazier's trade – that it encourages that trade to the amount of six francs – I grant it; I have not a word to say against it; you reason justly. The glazier comes, performs his task, receives his six francs, rubs his hands, and, in his heart, blesses the careless child. All this is that which is seen.

But if, on the other hand, you come to the conclusion, as is too often the case, that it is a good thing to break windows, that it causes money to circulate, and that the encouragement of industry in general will be the result of it, you will oblige me to call out, "Stop there! Your theory is confined to that which is seen; it takes no account of that which is not seen."

It is not seen that as our shopkeeper has spent six francs upon one thing, he cannot spend them upon another. It is not seen that if he had not had a window to replace, he would, perhaps, have replaced his old shoes, or added another book to his library. In short, he would have employed his six francs in some way, which this accident has prevented.

To be fair, you have to have a very high IQ to listen to Weezer. Cuomo's deep and introspective song writing is extremely subtle, and without a solid grasp of theoretical physics most of the lyrics will go over a typical listener's head. There's also Rivers' nihilistic outlook, which is deftly woven into his characterisation - his personal philosophy draws heavily from Narodnaya Volya literature, for instance. The fans understand this stuff; they have the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate the depths of these lyrics, to realize that they're not just poppy or catchy- they say something deep about LIFE. As a consequence people who dislike Weezer truly ARE idiots- of course they wouldn't appreciate, for instance, the humour in Rivers' existential catchphrase "I'm not a Happy Meal," which itself is a cryptic reference to Turgenev's Russian epic Fathers and Sons. I'm smirking right now just imagining one of those addlepated simpletons scratching their heads in confusion as Butch Walker's genius unfolds itself on their radios and Spotify playlists. What fools... how I pity them. 😂 And yes by the way, I DO have a Weezer Flying W tattoo =w=. And no, you cannot see it.

For those passing out candy 🍫 this year, can you please take into consideration on giving candy to teenagers 🤗.  Just take a second to think, would you rather have them be out drinking and driving putting not only their life in danger 🚨 with the possibility you and/or your child's life in danger, 😯* or someone else? 🤔^1. Or would you rather have them knocking on your door getting candy .. 🚪 Just think about that before you turn down candy to one of them 😀. I'd rather see a teen doing this rather than risking something dangerous. 💯 Just because they're 16 doesn't mean they don't deserve to have a little safe, legal fun. 🤷^2 Also size doesn't always determine mental age or special needs 💁. You may see a teenager but they may still relate as a younger child! 

Be kind 🖤 🎃

Obi-Wan doesn't need to be on the high ground, the high ground just needs to exist in the battle; Obi-Wan knows that when he has the low ground, he really has the high ground, from a certain point of view. Look at his battle record:

Maul: Has low ground, wins

Dooku: No high ground, loses

Greivous: Has low ground, wins

Vader: Has high ground, wins

Vader rematch: No high ground, loses

Obi-Wan with the high/low ground is canonically the most powerful Jedi. This is fact. Had Yoda not denied his request with typical Jedi arrogance, he could have beat Palpatine in the Senate building, which housed a variety of different altitudes; this so that the Chancellor could always have the moral high ground in Senate debates. But Obi-wan didn't fight Palpatine, and Yoda soon learned that you can't cleave the Sheev in a normal 1v1.

As we all know, spinning is a good trick. However, only the Chosen one can spin outside of a starfighter. Palpatine tried spinning, but he lost (but this was intentional, as losing gave him the emotional high ground when Anakin arrived). The reason for this is that spinning provides a yin-yang approach (based in Eastern philosophy on balance), giving the spinner the high ground from above and below. This is why Obi-Wan was so emotional after defeating Vader on Mustafar; he expected to lose the high ground to the spin, but Anakin failed to maintain balance in the universe, symbolic of his fall to the dark side.

Anakin doesn't hate sand for the reasons he told Padme; all Jedi hate sand, as the battlefield can rapidly change between low and high ground. This is the only reason why ______ killed ______ in Rebels. This is also why Obi-Wan hates flying; in space, there is no high ground as there is no frame of reference from which there is a high or low ground, due to the lack of gravity.

In ANH, Vader proves his newfound mastery by engaging Obi on perfectly even ground. However, he lets himself die on the Death Star so that he could train Luke from a higher plane of existence.

(Why was Vader so invested in the construction and maintenance of the Death Star? Because he knows Obi-wan can't have the high ground if there's no ground left.)

In Return of the Jedi, you can see that the Throne Room contains a variety of different altitudes; Palpatine placed these there to ensure Vader's defeat. However, Sheev failed to realize that his weakness was no ground, and should have covered that gaping pit that does nothing.

In conclusion, Obi-wan abuses spatial relativity and Buddhist doctrine in order to invoke his high-ground powers.

To be fair, you have to have a very high IQ to understand the "To be fair you have to have a very high IQ" meme. The sarcasm is extremely subtle, and without a solid grasp of dank memes and copy pasta, most people will actually think you like the thing you are copy pasting about. It provides a humorous format, which is highly adaptable to most fandoms- and allows anyone to make fun of both the thing people like, and the people who like it. The shitposters and trolls understand this stuff; they have the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate the depths of these memes, to realise that they’re not just sarcastic, they say something deep about whatever it is you hate on. As a consequence people who dislike the 'To be fair you have to have a very high IQ' meme truly ARE idiots- of course they wouldn’t appreciate, for instance, the seriousness in redditor Niekish's original post "To be fair you have to have a very high IQ to understand Rick and Morty..." which itself became a huge joke and such narrow-minded thinking is why the fandom is now considered to be cancerous and toxic. I’m smirking right now just imagining one of those addlepated normies scratching their heads in confusion as the genius wit of copy pasta unfolds itself on their screens. What fools.. how I pity them. 😂

Harry Potter tip-toes into the men's washroom, with a grimace on his face and his stomach groaning, he winces in pain as he waddles towards the bathroom stall, only to experience utter despair when he saw that it's already in use. Last night's haggis was taking it's toll on his digestive system and he could hold it in no longer.
>HRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRT PLOSSSSSSHHHHHHHHH
The smell of filth fills the room as Harry's clothes start to stain brown and a trickle of diarrhea runs down his legs
>SPLLLLLLLRRRRRRRRRT
A high pressure stream of liquid shit tears through his undergarments and pants and splurts against the wall behind him, dripping down and creating a large puddle on the floor below.
Harry buckles to his knees and collapses to the floor, his knees and hands now submerged in the puddle of his own buttsludge. The collapse splashed puddles of poo onto his face. As tears began to roll down his cheeks, the bathroom stall door unlocked, and emerged Severus Snape.

"What the bloody hell is that smell," he inquired, before looking down and seeing a defeated Potter in his own shit. A strange sense of sympathy waved over Severus as he leaned down, comforted Harry and proceeded to clean the feces of of him with his own tongue.

Snape's once pink tongue was coated with the colour brown as he collected the waste off of Harry's buttcheeks, hands and legs. Harry kept on whimpering with every stroke, and finally gasped when Severus's hand firmly grabbed onto his erect pe

We have too long dwelt in the darkness of ignorance. As a society we have continually shrouded ourselves in uninformed and uncultured opinions. We can not dwell in these ways any longer. In order to pull ourselves from the deep pit of simple-mindedness we have long wandered in, we must first understand a few fundamental ideas. The first of which is that Smashmouth’s 1999 hit “All-Star” is a work of lyrical genius that is absolutely teeming with important historical and literary references that demonstrate a strong command of both critical thinking processes and the art of humor. Take for instance the first line where lead vocalist Steve Harwell croons: “Somebody once told me the world is gonna roll me”. Here the band clearly takes a sly dig at round-earth theorists who insist on the earth’s spherical composition, when any true intellectual would hold firmly to the scientifically based fact that the earth is flat. Later in this musical masterpiece, we see the band’s firm grasp of historical events come into play in a series of remarkably clever lines such as “The ice we skate is getting pretty thin, the water’s getting warm so you might as well swim” which is a lighthearted yet veiled reference to the tragic events of the R.M.S Titanic. It doesn’t end here however. In the next line the bands supreme wit reveals itself once more saying “My world’s on fire, how about yours?” Which is another historical reference to the events of the catastrophic volcanic eruption of the ancient Roman city of Pompeii. This humor is so deftly woven in that the uneducated would surely miss this clear-cut reference. Who else would think to make a joke regarding volcanic eruption using a swift yet deep rhetorical question? I chuckle heartedly every time I think on this. 
- [ ] As a whole, the song All-Star is an allegory for National Basketball Association. The song seeks to use historical references to connect to the current state of the game of professional basketball. The spherical reference is the basketball itself. The Titanic reference cleverly points to some teams “tanking”. Furthermore, some teams are “on fire” much like the city of Pompeii while others can’t seem to get it going. The chorus further reflects this idea saying “Hey now, an all-star get your game on, go play”. The NBA forces it’s top players to simply play the game, insisting that “all that glitters is gold, only shooting stars break the mold”. The National Basketball Association has convinced its players that they must succeed on the court to succeed in life, thus distracting them from the greater social issues in front of them. This song is an absolute masterclass of 90s pop and it’s intellect is far beyond it’s time as it thumps across funky beats and strong social views in the key of F-Sharp at 104 beats per minute. 

And you daft fools thought it was just a song written for the Shrek movie? I am embarrassed for you.

OK, smartypants, tha's funny and all, but it's not what makes mods smarter. This is due to several factors: 

 • Smarter people tend to seek out mod positions. Reddit itself is proof of that. I challenge you to show an example of a mod of a subreddit of more than 5k members doing something stupid. 

 • Modding takes hard work, so dumb people tend to give up. Smart people tend to hold a monopoly on hard work. Dumb people tend to be lazy. That's why the sheep need shepherds like us to show them the way. 

 • The vast majority of Reddit mods are successful in life. Who has time to mod r/funny between applying for food stamps? If you're modding a default, you likely have made it in life so well that you have enough time left over to do something like mod a default. 

Mods are smarter. It's just the way it is. It's OK, it's our burden to bear. And heavy is the head that wears the crown. And before you Xpost this to ShitAmericansSay, your main sub, yes I am an American. And I'll proudly stand up, next to you, to defend her still today.

OKAY so I am angry about one of the most coveted tenets of neckbeard culture. Their most exalted item of clothing. Their most revered headgear, even more so than their chinese-made Naruto headband. Their Fedoras.

I, personally, have always felt an affinity towards early 20th century culture, and the appropriation of many of its tenets by the neckbeards angers me. (Obviously those were not good times for a large portion of society, and I do not claim it as such. I merely believe that there were high points that we could take note of going forwards.) 

Neckbeards have taken this perfectly defensible, innocent, and attractive object, and soiled it with their attitudes and general negative perception in society. 

Sorry if this wasn't really an interesting rant but it felt good to get out there. How do you guys feel about the fedora as an item of clothing (in its original context)?

P.S. The reason for this rant was this post, because I feel like this item should not have a negative connotation, but due to a certain sect of society, it has one.

To be sensible, you require a high IQ to comprehend Rick and Morty. The keenness is to an exceptional degree clear, and without a strong handle of theoretical material science the greater part of the jokes will go over a standard watchers head. There's other than Rick's suspicious perspective, which is deftly woven into his characterisation-his own specific speculation draws vivaciously from Narodnaya Volya making, for example. The fans comprehend this stuff; they have the instructive ability to truly regard the profundities of these jokes, to understand that they're not starting late beguiling they say something some place down concerning LIFE. Thusly people who genuinely severely dislike Rick and Morty really ARE morons unmistakably they wouldn't see, for example, the sharp in Rick's existential catchphrase "Wubba Lubba Dub," which itself is an entrancing reference to Turgenevs Russian epic Fathers and Sons. I'm smiling beginning at now on an extremely essential level envisioning one of those baffled numbskulls scratching their heads in puzzle as Dan Harmon's virtuoso character spreads out itself on their TV screens. What fools.. how I feel perplexed about them. ? 

What's more, genuinely, luckily, I DO have a Rick and Morty tattoo. In like manner, no, you can't see it. It's for the women's eyes just and, at long last they need to show that they're inside 5 IQ inspirations driving my own (ideally lower) starting at now. Nothin staff kid ?

If you take the derivative of the French-Indian War, due to the quantumkinetic force, the significant figures in the foci and vertex of the standard quark is perpendicular to the axis. And if the phenotypic ratios are given as dy/dx and the gene loci are located 20 units from each other on the same chromosome. Depending on the units used, if I was in Africa they would use bones, but not from food because they lack that in the first place so they would use bones from their own. And if you take the chromosome out of a human, it results in the baby having severe autism depending on what chromosome is taken out. If you read between lines using the Kryptocurrency trickle down economics theorem then the phenotypic ratios is the formula for Langragian Density over the longest calculation of pi. Which comes down to a total of Hella Bread and 17 cents.

[Pingu](https://myanimelist.net/anime/36259/Pingu_in_the_City) in the city is a straight out master piece.
The show explores dark and grotesque themes. Pingu lives in an isolated ice world where few interactions between penguins find place. The show transitions from Pingu's isolated world into a vibrant city. This is actually a metaphor for Pingu's journey through cognitive therapy in order to for him to get rid of his mental disorder and live a normal city life. Many of the themes and humor are very subtle and requires the viewer to re-watch the show at least ten time to finally be able to grasp the true creative meaning.
The show also draws inspiration from books like The Gulag Acapellago; where Solzhenitsyn's struggles are embodied in Pingu as a character. Instead of navigating through the soviet gulags Pingu must fine his way in the city where he is mentally beat down continuously, making this show historically relevant aswell. is It's not often that a master piece comes along. I'm confident that this show will go down in cult classic history and be discussed for many years to come.

We now live in an age where common sense is not common. Even if it is, we would rather agree and passively or aggressively go along with whatever views we find among others, so long as the person or material providing the opinion is influential, or the opinion widely accepted. The merit of the actual statement or ideology is secondary. This is not to say there isn’t a time and a place where chaotic, challenging discussion should not take center stage, but we are getting to a point where people shun radical discussion for the sake of it, and the reason for this, is that it is not easy.  A surprisingly relevant aspect that rears its head time and time again in our current culture is how EASY something is. This shows up in many, many things; a great amount of how we think and how we act can be attributed to how easy something seems to us, and this is not always a bad thing, however, it has been exploited and left unattended to become this mental laziness present in many, many, many people. Laziness of the mind is a seductively dangerous thing to succumb to, and some examples of this would be how people have formed their opinions and personal viewpoints, even matters of principle, all over what is easiest for them to adopt. Whether this matter is social, political, spiritual, even intellectual, people have a tendency to pick or adopt their view based on how easy it is to comprehend, to practice, or to rally behind. A colossal example of this would be stereotypes. Now, the problem with stereotypes is not their comedic uses, nor is it the emotional distress it may arise within some people. It is the indirect effect these generalizations have when they are taken fanatically seriously. Many issues can be boiled down to people taking overblown, fanatical stereotypes of a group, always considered “them” and taking them seriously, acting out nearly as fanatical against it in response in the strange, repressed rage-addled ways people have conflicted with each other for as long as history has been recorded. This causes the other group to see these fanatics, and make a generalization based off of one person about anyone who may share any number of aspects with them, and this back and forth violence and hostility continues, exacerbated by well-known organizations that are supposed to be providing facts, but alternatively choose to report violence and hostility that breeds more violence and hostility, simply because it’s easier to run a business that way. This can be traced all the way up to the most wealthy and powerful people in the world, who have gotten there through taking the easy way and actively making choices that subjugate others for their own sake. That statement itself, on those who hold power and money, was itself a generalization. One that may influence others in that demographic to hold the same position against people who aren’t rich, or powerful. However, the main subject of this is that we’re getting to a point where free speech is almost subtly been suppressed. I’m not talking about the freedom to insult or berate; many people who use that response are unaware that people have the right to react in whatever way they choose within the confines of the law, and may even act outside of it. Conversation is what got us this far as a species. To this degree, the internet is a testament to humanity’s ideas and wants, but has furthered this laziness of the very mind to persist. And now you have these individuals at the head of these intrinsically subjugating, amoral corporations, living with pride and greed and lies as their bible, trying to censor and control the one fantastically and horrifyingly free aspect of modern times. If the modern ruling class get their way, like they have so many times, the highest, richest man, who more than likely achieved his status through amoral and despicable means, will control what we know, and what we see, even what we use online. Currently, the point we now find ourselves in teeters dangerously close to an Orwellian dystopia.

Dora the Explorer is actually much deeper than most viewers think. It is much more than a kid's show, it has clevers references and a hidden backstory for the adults watching with their infant but most older consumers do not understand them because they are simply not smart enough to. For example, Boots the monkey is deeply inspired by Hanuman from Indian mythology. Hanuman is revered for his bravery, loyalty, and devotion. Guess which monkey is loyal, brave, and devoted to Dora? That's right, Boots. But it's not just Boots. What about Swiper? Foxes are often characterised to be sly and cunning. In Dogon mythology, the pale fox is the trickster god of the desert. He would only come out in attempt to fool man whether that was for personal gain or simply for his own amusement. He was often fended off by being yelled at. Swiper the fox shares these characteristics. Now you may be wondering hiw deep this show goes, so ask yourself this: where is the rest of Dora's family? We have met Dora's mother and father, her twin baby brother and sister, her two cousins Diego and Alicia (who also love exploring, take note, this will come up later) and Dora's grandmother. Now Dora's parents and grandmother are clearly not the explorer type since they hardly ever leave the house. So who taught Dora to read maps, swing from vines and to keep safe? The same can be asked for Diego and Alicia, who also know how to talk to animals and track them. Also note how we never see any family of Diego and Alicia aside from Dora's family. They even live alone in the jungle. Here's my theory: an uncle of Dora (who would also be the mother or father of Diego and Alicia) taught the children the skills to explore and taught Diego and Alicia to care for animals but died in action. Now Dora loves to explore but doesn't know how to look after animals. What if this mystery uncle was training Dora to look after animals but died before he could finish? It makes sense. Now you may be asking me how I know its an uncle. If you are, you are clearly one of the many intellectually lacking peasants who cannot understand the deeper meanings of Dora the Explorer, it is glaringly obvious: Boots is the uncle; the uncle is recruiting Dora but then dies in action, then he is reincarnated as Boots to continue his training and to watch over Dora. The parents clearly have no worries about Dora going off with only a monkey to care for her. So do they family know who Biots really is? "Then what happens after Boots fully trains Dora" the inferior viewers ask. Well obviously Dora will go live with Diego and Alicia to look after the creatures of the jungle and then Boots will train the twins Guillermo and Isabella. And whoever comes next in the family will be trained before Boots passes away and Alicia will take over as the teacher, proud of the legend he has passed on. Still think Dora the Explorer is for kids now?

That last word. That's the real problem isn't it. People. Religion, science, capitalism, film, traveling, technology, video games, music. All good in theory and many times in practice. But many times they're aren't. Why? Not because of the subject itself. But because of people. Reddit is a prime example. In theory its a great idea. But guess who screwed it up? People. Granted, also bots. But people first. The bots were only the frosting.

Driving. Great idea. What caused all the crashes and danger? People--crappy drivers.

The internet. Again, great, except for all those people who troll and flame anonymously. Or the people who want to monetize it and exploit it.

People. You can boil it all down to that. AI programmed to be decent, on the other hand, will be great.

It is confirmed that Rick and Morty is Stealing from El Chavo Animado. This picture of El Chavo Animado was taken before Steven Universe and The Amazing World of Gumball, I will not be talking about them however, because their ideas were completely original, and that is what you should respect out of them. But Rick and Morty was made in 2013, and this was made way earlier, Back in 2006. And this episode exactly was created at that time. You can see by the picture that there is a mysterious object is the glass, which is where Justin Roiland got the “Plumbus”
And The scientist that is “Rick,”  Chavo as “Morty”.
And you should know that the scientist is The One who knows everything, and Chavo doesn’t.
It is Uncannily similiar to the show that we know today. I do NOT approve of what Justin Roiland is doing. He’s making “his own show” but he’s not giving credit to the primary source, we should get Rick and Morty discipline and give El Chavo Animado the love it needs for giving us its beauty.
And some of you might say that they got it from back to the future. Which they did not. There is a lot of differences in the Back to the future and Rick and Morty universe. I will not let Rick and Morty steal from another. It’s dumb. it must be stopped at once.

It's amazing how you think you know me so well. My doctor, a straight up medical professional thinks I'm perfectly healthy. I'm 5' 9", 135 lbs, heart rate of 65 bpm, 115/75 blood pressure. A month ago I ran a 5 k in 14 mins, I run 2 miles everyday and do push ups, sit ups and other exercises every night at home on top of having an active lifestyle. I rock climb and go hiking regularly. I understand that you think you need to go to the gym to be healthy but you don't and you're wrong. Maybe if I wanted to bulk up my muscle mass, but that's not something I want to do. And for the record, having big muscles doesn't mean you're healthy either. You can be ripped and have a shit cardiovascular system, which is what's really important. Stop judging someone you don't know. Sorry for the rant but you're kinda pissing me off.

A few days ago, a redditor by the name of rooster_86 uploaded a gif to the popular subreddit highqualitygifs. Now the gif itself, is nothing remarkable. It contains the usual self-aware and meta humour you'd find on the subreddit. And if what I just said make no sense, don't worry, it's really not important, I'm just setting up the punchline. Because the punchline is not in the gif. It's in the comment section. You see, when you go to the comment section of this gif, you'll find that just about every single comment is by rooster_86, and there are hundreds and hundreds of comments. He's making and replying to his own threads. There's every concievable type of comment. Even the [?] way too long comments and some copypastas, thrown in for good measure. Rooster_86 is satirizing not just the subreddit, but reddit as a whole. It's quite funny and, in my opinion, kinda genius. And it got me thinking, could this joke format work in another medium, like Facebook or the YouTube comment section? I don't know. Well, that's it. Just wanted to share. Thanks for watching!﻿

Raise your hand if you’ve felt personally victimized by candy corn. Is it corn? Is it candy? NO. It is neither, not by a long shot. It’s not fooling anyone, so why does it feel the need to so blatantly deceive us? It does not look, taste, smell, or act like corn. It most definitely cannot be considered candy because candy is meant to taste good. I’m sorry if you’ve been tricked, but this benign-looking confection is living a lie.

To be fair, you have to have a very high IQ to understand Lil Pump. The rhythm is extremely subtle, and without a solid grasp of socialist internationalism most of the vibes will go over a typical listener's head. There’s also Lil Pump's nihilistic outlook, which is deftly woven into his characterisation- his personal philosophy draws heavily from the works of Vladmir Lenin, for instance. The fans understand this stuff; they have the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate the depth of his music, to realise that it doesn't just sound good- it says something deep about LIFE. As a consequence people who dislike Lil Pump truly ARE idiots- of course they wouldn’t appreciate, for instance, the insight in Lil Pump's existential catchphrase “Fuck your airline, Fuck your company” which itself is a cryptic reference to Lenin's masterpiece "What is to be Done?" I’m smirking right now just imagining one of those addlepated simpletons scratching their heads in confusion as Gazzy Garcia's genius wit unfolds itself in their ears What fools.. how I pity them. 😂
   
And yes, by the way, i DO have a Lil Pump tattoo. And no, you cannot see it. It’s for the ladies’ eyes only- and even then they have to demonstrate that they’re within 10 gucci sneakers of my own collection (preferably lower) beforehand. Nothin personnel kid 😎

Honestly, Lil Pump is potentially the most intelligent rapper right now. The amount of thought that goes into these songs is insane! And I'm not just referring to the amazing mixing his album contains. The fact that each and every verse he raps is categorised into verses, and that every point Lil Pump makes is instantly followed by an example of why it's 100% true. Mainstream rappers aren't smart enough to be able to put together valid arguments that are logical and non-contradictory. Those that are uneducated will just release a 3 minute disstrack with a bunch of rented cars & swearing. A highly educated individual like Lil Pump can make a meaningful album with 10x the length, because he has 10x more logic and intelligence.

To my abusive friend Kennedy, I have your phone number, email address, IP and passwords. And if you don't do what I say I will literally kill your phone.

It will go something like this. I will set my sms bomber to use another caller ID. You can;t block me. Then I will tell it to send you 10,000 texts, all about 3 paragraph long. This is more texts than you have ever received. Your phone is not built for this. First, the storage will fill up, then it will start using cellular data (approx 28 gigs), Then you will lose control, then your phone will lose power, it won't turn on again unless i want it to, and even then you will have so many texts to delete by hand...

But all this can be avoided. Check the comments section of this reddit every 24 hours for updates. If you tell anyone, your phone gets it (not to mention your wifi connection) oh, and I have installed a ghost tracker into your software.

so I saw a boy go into the bathroom. He was super hot, nice ass, so I followed him in and I fisted him. And I couldn't stop like my dick was at the max. then his sister came in. She was mega hot too, red hair that I needed to cum all over. I had too her get in on the rape too. At the end of the day cum was all over them and I was in handcuffs with my dick hanging out. That was what I am most famous for, I have done many other federal offenses. Once a farmer called the cops because I was fucking his cows all night. Let's just say it was my utter spewing the milk.

Found on 4chan -

Allow me to blow your mind

Blue's Clues is the most deep and enthraling television program ever released to western audiences. It covers various deep subjects like loss, and addiction. You see, Blue's Clues is actually about 25 year old man named Steve. Steve was a young boy from New York, who was heavily abused by his father. His father, an obvious alcoholic trope, would constantly beat his son because of the fact that his wife left him. This left Steve scarred and confused, with his only friend being his Labrador Retriever, Blue. Blue was a good dog, and Steve did his best to take care of him. But one day, Blue got rabies, and Steve's dad had to shoot i in the back of the head like Old Yeller. This drove Steve to the brink, and as he grew up, Steve grew more disillusioned with the world through both his insanity and his heavy use of LSD and cocaine. That is where we arrive in Blue's Clues, Steve has now grown up, and ives in an abandoned house in northern New York State. He has been evading his taxes, and every day recieves a letter from the IRS telling him that they are going to catch him. Steve does not realize this, however, because he is so doped up on drugs, that he thinks he is in a TV show, and that the mailbox is talking to him. That's where the "We just got a letter" song came from. Now, you may be wondering, "What about Blue you jackass OP." And you're right, what about Blue. Well, Steve, in all of his grief, has now been hallucinating Blue. Now the dog is actually Blue, and makes weird noises that come straight from Ed, Edd, & Eddy's opening. The dog constantly tries to bring Steve to the truth by giving him clues, so that he can escape this false realty that he has made, but alas, it does not work. Steve also hallucinates a Magenta dog, and a Green dog, but they are irrelevant because they are not Blue. The only truly existing things are the Salt, Pepper, and Paprika spices, as they are actual containers of these spices in Steve's kitchen

I really am fucking tired of one liners like this, everytime I see it I just imagine world's biggest moron sitting there with smug smile feeling so smart and amusing. Probably drinking battery acid and downvoting any attempt of thought.

the most common example "oh people wonder why nobody can recognize superman without his glasses but are ok with man flying and shooting lasers with his eyes? there is internal inconsistency in the world WITH MAGIC AND TALKING ANIMALS? eL yU eL eX Dee"

suspension of disbelief, bitch, heard about it?? the willing acceptance of unbelievable part of the story as true according to the laws of presented setting?

in a world presented in superman we are informed about magical aliens, but nobody has told us that everyone is a moron, in a same way I'm quite sure talking animal people appeared in dota before but I have yet to call butterfly a goddamn sparrow, but man who even uses words like narrative coherence? some nerd? Who cares if you can drop a HILLARIOUS one liner that NOBODY has ever seen or heard before. Logic? Not in MY dota! Cmon there are dragons there!

Shut the fuck up. I'm so tired of being disrespected on this goddamn website. All I wanted to do was post my opinion. MY OPINION. But no, you little bastards think it's "hilarious" to mock those with good opinions. My opinion. while not absolute, is definitely worth the respect to formulate an ACTUAL FUCKING RESPONSE AND NOT JUST A SHORT MEME OF A REPLY. I've been on this site for 6 months: 6 MONTHS and I have never felt this wronged. It boils me up that I could spend so much time thinking and putting effort into things while you shits sit around (probably jerking off to traps or whatever gay shit you like) and make fun of the intellectuals of this world. I've bored you? Good for fucking you. Literally no one cares that your little brain is to underdeveloped and rotted to comprehend my idea...MY GREAT GREAT IDEA.

I'm done with this goddamn site and you goddamn immature children. I have lived my life up until this point having to deal with memesters and idiots like you. I know how you work.

Gentlemen, a short view back to the past. Thirty years ago, Niki Lauda told us: "Take a trained monkey, place him into the cockpit and he is able to drive the car." Thirty years later Sebastian told us: "I had to start my car like a computer. It's very complicated." And Nico Rosbeg said, err, he pressed during the race, I don't remember what race, the wrong button on the wheel. Question for you to both. Is formula 1 driving today too complicated with 20 and more buttons on the wheel, are you too much under effort, under pressure? What are your wishes for the future, concerning technical program, errrm, during the race? Less buttons, more? Or less and more comunication with your engineers.

To be fair, the person that I am currently talking to, which indicates you have to have a very high iq to understand go,go diego. The humour is extremely subtle, and without a solid grasp of theoretical physics most of the jokes will go over a typical viewer’s upper part of the body in humans or other animals, joined to the trunk by the neck, containing the brain, eyes, ears, nose, and mouth. There’s alsodiego's nihilistic outlook, which is deftly woven into his characterisation- his personal philosophy draws heavily from narodnaya volya literature, for instance. The fans understand the thing I am referring that is a stuff; a group of living beings that I am referring to have the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate the depths of these jokes, to realise that they’re not just funny- a group of living beings that I am referring to say a certain undetermined or unspecified thing deep about life. As a consequence a group of human beings regarded as individuals who dislike go,go diego truly are idiots- of course a group of living beings that I am referring to wouldn’t appreciate, for instance, the humour in rick’s existential catchphrase “Any Endangered Species In Distress” which itself is a cryptic reference to turgenev’s russian epic fathers and sons.

WAR. WAR never changes. Since the dawn of human kind, when our ancestors first discovered the home run power of ball and bat, balls have been hit in the name of everything: from Mike Trout to Barry Bonds to simple, Scooter .

In the year 2017, after millennia of no home runs, the destructive nature of Stanton reigned supreme and It could sustain itself no longer. The dongs were plunged into an abyss of centerfield pools and parking lots. But it was not, as some had predicted, the end of the home run record. Instead, the Final Dong was simply too hard to break no Man of human history. Or Stanton had succeeded in destroying the record - but WAR, WAR never changes.

In the early days, thousands were spared the horrors of the Ruth by taking refuge in Club House underground shelters, known as Dugouts. But when they emerged, they had only the hell of 100MPH fastballs to greet them - all except those in Cincinnati Ohio. For on that fateful day, when dongs rained from the sky, the giant steel door of /r/baseballcirclejerk slid closed... and never reopened. It was here you were born. It is here you will die.

Because, in /r/baseballcirclejerk: no one ever enters, and no one ever leaves.

As a MAN of great logic and intelligence I’d like to have some of your time today.  For those who don’t believe my claim my IQ is 269 and I blast LIL Pump.  Along with having a masters in economics, combat, complex mathematics with a minor in biology chem and physical fitness (Gotta keep the body as sharp as the mind).  What I am going to share with you today may shock you and be a little uncomfortable for you because this is something never before discussed as I am currently the only person in existence who has the knowledge to make the discoveries needed to be able to say this.  I will now present you with my thesis:  “Fish are friends not food” . Over my extensive time spent studying the logistics of this statement I have written numerous books and papers outlining the research and development involved in such studies.  How you might ask ?  Simple.   I started with a quick Yoga session,  it is necessary to configure the mind body connection.  Years and years of yoga,  Hot yoga,  advanced yoga.  Yoga here yoga there and yoga everywhere.  On my pursuit of this deep connection I found myself eating mushrooms provided by my nutritionist.  Picked from the amazon rain forest costing a large 420$ per mg I began my journey into the mind.  While maintaining perfect diet I was able to meet my spirit god.  The fish.  Now this was no ordinary fish.  My friend phil (the fish) was the product of malformed communist beta fish.  This had seemed to be something in his life that had him feeling unsure about himself.  Now during my studies and majoring in psychology I felt equipped to help my new companion.  as we sat down in the office chairs on the 69th floor of the empire state building drinking air just shooting the shit.  He starts opening up.  He says I don’t know why humans feel the need to fish.  He says to me as he leaned(sprite in the 🅱️up) in “We feel hurt that the connection you try to make with us comes with a peace offering followed by a sharp hook”  I say back to him, taken back by what he had said.  I said fuck you kid I do what i want.  Im a rank 99 gurdian and I don’t take shit from a fish.  He tries to calm me down and I notice his intentions are genuine.  This is when I realized that fish just want to be our friends.  With the remaining time on the expensive trip I finished my 4th book edition 3.  “Fish are friends not food”  - The next up.  I hoped you learned from this.  namaste  friend.

The homosexual devil and its lesbian hobbits will not allow such a gesture because it would void the point of frustration and anger they are trying to induce upon the humans who play the game.

No one can manipulate the market with this action, but EA can manipulate the human. The devil, who carefully designed this game, and its lesbian hobbits, work day and night to try and deceive, anger and accuse humans. They troll reddit posts, and downvote any post that does not fit their evil narrative of deceiving humans and hate.

They get a kick out of it. Not because they want your money. The money is only a constellation. They truly just hate humans and want them all to be robots under their control. The evil aliens on this planet, maintain EA sports, and they want your soul.

Don't give it to them. Don't feed their hate.

It's a very-loved cult classic game where it gets better the more you play it. We started around 2 pm and ended around 8 or 8:30. The rules were complicated though and we had to double check things. People were also distracted with things like football, making food, drinking beer, arguing about rules, and receiving passive aggressive text messages from significant others, so we could likely knock it out quicker if we needed to. Depending on your gaming group you might like it. Its more complicated and does have some random elements but it's an alright game. I won the game by randomly selecting a race that's considered mid tier and completely outplaying and trashing my competition. 😉

OK, smartypants, tha's funny and all, but it's **not** what makes mods smarter.  This is due to several factors:  

*  Smarter people tend to seek out mod positions.  Reddit itself is proof of that.  I challenge you to show an example of a mod of a subreddit of more than 5k members doing something stupid.  

*  Modding takes hard work, so dumb people tend to give up.  Smart people tend to hold a monopoly on hard work.  Dumb people tend to be lazy.  That's why the sheep need shepherds like us to show them the way.  

*  The vast majority of Reddit mods are successful in life.  Who has time to mod r/funny between applying for food stamps?  If you're modding a default, you likely have made it in life so well that you have enough time left over to do something like mod a default.  

Mods *are* smarter.  It's just the way it is.  It's OK, it's our burden to bear. And heavy is the head that wears the crown.  And before you Xpost this to ShitAmericansSay, your main sub, yes I am an American.  And I'll proudly stand up, next to you, to defend her still today.

I know this may seem random, but I think that "Spongebob SquarePants, his friends, and the rest of the sentience of Bikini Bottom was created From a Nuke in Bikini Atoll Scenario wasn't so far fetched after all.

Why do I think this you all say?, Well the Theory is said that Spongebob, his Freinds are the result of Nuclear Experiments gone wrong when a Nuke was shot in Bikini Atoll, thus later on the sudden Mutations caused the Residents there to Level up from Primal Instinct, to full sentience, so the Theory goes, due to the given Fact that "Bikini Bottom." And Bikini Atoll sounds alot more familiar, and in the older seasons in the Episode "Dying for Pie." Showed Stock Footage of the mushroom Cloud when the Bomb went off, to make matters a little more clear, Stephen Hillenburg, the Author of the Show is a marine biologist.

And in this episode, the Green Metor might secretly be an Antidote for the Mutations, and if you think that's weird, Sandy's friend "Frenchy." Who is inside a submarine observing and calculating, In his point of calculation said that the Metor "is something from the volcano that only appears for 100 year's and turns fish "back to their primal selves." "  although not much backstory is explained for Frenchy, could he be up to something? Stephen Hillenburg might have some Clever lore we might have overlooked.

But then again this is just a theory (no pun attended if you thought it was coming.) It just came into my mind for some reason, I don't know about y'all.

To be fair, you have to have a very high IQ to understand the negative effects of medical marijuana. The side effects are extremely subtle, and without a solid grasp of theoretical neurobiology, most of the facts will go over a typical users's head. There's also DARE's nihilistic outlook, which is deftly woven into their statements - the DEA's personal philosophy draws heavily from 30's film propaganda, for instance. 

The non user's understand this stuff; they have the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate the depths of these facts, to realize that they're not just potentially thorough- they say something deep about DRUGS. As a consequence people who smoke pot truly ARE idiots- of course they wouldn't appreciate, for instance, the research in Harry J. Anslinger's existencial catchphrase 

"Most marijuana smokers are colored people, jazz musicians, and entertainers. Their satanic music is driven by marijuana, and marijuana smoking by white women makes them want to seek sexual relations with Negroes, entertainers, and others. It is a drug that causes insanity, criminality, and death — the most violence-causing drug in the history of mankind." 

Which itself is a cryptic reference to George Hirliman's black and white epic Reefer Madness. I'm smirking right now just imagining one of those addlepated simpletons scratching their heads in confusion as President Richard Nixon's genius unfolds itself on their television screens. What fools... how I pity them. 😂 And yes by the way, I DO have a Harry J. Anslinger tattoo. And no, you cannot see it. It's for the sober ladies' eyes only- And even they have to demonstrate that they're within 5 IQ points of my own (preferably lower) beforehand. 🤔🤔🤔

Excuse me? Are you disrespecting he greatest storyteller of rap? Or of all time? He has made several different songs to where he deeply explains his life, and how it is now that he is rich and famous, and that he is not on the street anymore. How dare you say that this man, who wrote these amazing lyrics, which deeply goes into your heart, wraps up to your brain, and wiggles it around, trying to look for open space, are any one of those "mumble" rappers.Young Thug is trying to make a message to everyone, and you're brain will not let you process the amaziness of Young Thug's storytelling, because your brain thinks he is trash. This man is a soundcloud rapper who sings and raps the most vivid pictures in your head, and he is risking the hate that you are giving him right now just because of his appearance and apparently his music? I have to tell you, all of us were like you at one point, but you do not understand how deep that this man goes into his lyrics. Young Thug deserves praise, and will be in the  Rock and Roll Hall Of Fame, that's how great he is. He can switch different instrumentals, such as Misunderstood, where he uses his auto tune perfectly, like he always does. Not only that, he uses an instrumental that includes a guitar in the back with pianos, making it rock/rap. It is truly a gift that God has given us to have a unique character like Young Thug in the rap game to switch instrumentals like that. Im not even into his lyrics yet. Let's take a look at his first hit song, where he vividly explains his new Lifestyle. Here is a line that will make your brain open a little bit more to Thug's music to let in the amazingness flood into your brain, blocking out many of these haters that listen to the terrible rappers today, such as Kendrick Lamar and Tyler, The Creator. Anyway, back to the song, as your mind will open up to Thug a little more:
"We came straight from the bottom to the top, my lifestyle"
How can you not say this is an amazing line? He illustrates how he was born in the hood, and he could not get out, and music found a way into his heart. He was determine,
 to make the amazing music he does today. This music also gives him money to reach this here "lifestyle" that he was dreaming of having. You already feel your brain going deep into his lyrics, as you are opening up to him a little more. 
Here's another one:
"I got a moms, bitch, she's got a moms bitch"
This explains how he has a Mom, and if your brain opens up a little more (it probably did), you see that this is more than taking it literal. He clearly states that he has a Mom that cares for him in the hard times, and he will do anything for her. Now that he has all his money, he will give his mom money as well.  You see how great of a storyteller he is? It's only one line too! How dare you say this man is trash when he makes music for the people who truly understand rap, who likes listening to the greatness of rap and storytelling. How dare you not say he is not in the names of Tupac, and Biggie? Even his name has a story!!! Don't you see? His name is titled "Young Thug"
Let's separate each word, shall we?
"Young"- This states that this rapper is a young person, and started his rap career when he was young. He is only 26 too, which only proves my point.
"Thug"- This shows that he is a Thug, he will beat you if he really has to. He hangs around with all of he gangsters, because he is one, too. Let's combine his name now.
"Young Thug" this shows that he is not only young, but he is a thug as well. Take everything I said from those two definitions and combine it. Now do you think he's the GOAT? If you don't think so, he's definitely the greatest storyteller of all time. OF ALL TIME. NOT EVEN RAP. What's your favorite book? Take a book that Young Thug would write, and put that at your 1 spot, because if he wrote a book, he would be the greatest author of all time. Hell, he doesn't even need to write a book. All of his songs have a vivid picture than your mind cant control, which makes it go over your head, and that's why you think he's trash. But, if you are the opposite, and is open minded, to the point where you can stand Young Thug, he will be the greatest rapper of all time. So don't tell me that Young Thug is garbage if you don't even know the real reason behind his music. Smh😤

A liberal Muslim homosexual ACLU lawyer professor and abortion doctor was teaching a class on Karl Marx, known atheist

“Before the class begins, you must get on your knees and worship Marx and accept that he was the most highly-evolved being the world has ever known, even greater than Jesus Christ!”

At this moment, a brave, patriotic, pro-life Navy SEAL champion who had served 1500 tours of duty and understood the necessity of war and fully supported all military decision made by the United States stood up and held up a rock.

“How old is this rock?”

The arrogant professor smirked quite Jewishly and smugly replied “4.6 billion years, you stupid Christian”

“Wrong. It’s been 5,000 years since God created it. If it was 4.6 billion years old and evolution, as you say, is real… then it should be an animal now”

The professor was visibly shaken, and dropped his chalk and copy of Origin of the Species. He stormed out of the room crying those liberal crocodile tears.

The students applauded and all registered Republican that day and accepted Jesus as their lord and savior. An eagle named “Small Government” flew into the room and perched atop the American Flag and shed a tear on the chalk. The pledge of allegiance was read several times, and God himself showed up and enacted a flat tax rate across the country.

The professor lost his tenure and was fired the next day. He died of the gay plague AIDS and was tossed into the lake of fire for all eternity.

On which his mother was rejoiced 😁 and said "Ya bro 🤘💯 keeping  ready in 1⃣0⃣ mins 🕢🕣🕤🕚🕐"
On hearing👂this our protagonist went to the bathroom 🛀 to do potty 💩.
After spending 1⃣5⃣ mins in the bathroom our protagonist👱🏾 came out 
To eat the potato 🥔 smilies😃 thinking they must have been ready 5⃣ mins ago.
As soon as he took a bite his mouth burnt 😱😱🔥 🔥 because they had just been fried.
So please 🙏 wish him a speedy 🏎 recovery and send him your best wishes 💐
1 share in other group = 1 prayer 🙏
Ignore for bad luck 🍀

Its because of what other people do is what shapes the impression of our community to others just look at the (i couldve thought of a better example) bronies i have met some bronies (me not being into that show in anyway possible) that are pretty damn chill its just some are monkey see monkey do. Our fandom or community can be chill and not have people that belive you need a high iq to watch rick and morty or freak out about some sauce that you can simply buy at a store. Im a JoJo fan myself but im still loyal to a rather enlarged community that i am a part in, sure i may not post as much here but just not doing what those crazy fucktards we call "fans" do at mcdonalds. Some fans choose to embarass themselves in front of others just to get kicks but that is just a selfish move because you are not thinking about the fandom you are part of that you are representing out in the general public or the mainstream media. Then there are those who look down upon people who have lower iq's then them even as going out of there way to take iq tests and let those shape who they and in the end they become assholes or jerks who are just annoying and you dont want them around. I dont like to think of myself as intelligent but i have been told many times before that im "gifted" now these people belive that they are "gifted" because they watch a show about grandfather and son who the grandfather happens to be smart. Sure as kids we all dreamed of being our favourite characters on tv or books, sometimes we ran around the playgrpund like naruto sure we tried to go super saiyan like goku, sure we wanted to have magic wand like Harry Potter but we grew out of that acting and got a grasp of reality, however we can still have fun with it just not act like children anymore. These people who think now they have a high iq because they watch this show or they protest at mcdonalds about some sauce just need to GROW THE FUCK UP and get over it obsess with your show on the internet where its safe now not in the public like children

Boots looked at Dora lovingly. He had loved her the moment she got him that blue bouncy ball. "Hey Dora?" Boots asked, "can I ask you something?"
"Of course, love!"
"Hey Dora, I know you're only seven, but will you do the honor of having my monkey-human freak child?"
"Of course Boots, maybe we should start soon."
"Okay. Mom and dad aren't home so we can do it now!" Boots said excitedly.
"Yay!" Dora said, bringing boots to her pink bedroom.
"I know where your parents hide the sex toys" said Boots lovingly staring into Dora's eyes.
"Okay where? I'll go get them," Dora said, a smile growing on her face.
"In their bedroom in the third drawer on the right."
"Okay, I'll be right back!" Dora says, waking out of her room and into her parents room.
Hooray! Thought Boots, I've been waiting for this for three years! He did not understand how weird that was. Dora walked back into the room, sex toys in hand. They were pink and purple and very long.
"Shall we get started?" Dora asked, staring at Boots.
"Of course!" Yelled Boots. Just then, Swiper jumped in through the window, running over to Dora.
"I gon steal those so I can pleausure myself. I don't have anyone that wants to fuck me!"
Dora was surprised at his language. 'Pleasure himself?' It was evident (as she is a little bitch) that 'fuck' was no worry to her.
"No need to steal them when you can just join us!" Dora said, trying to protect her toys.
"REALLY? Oh thanks!"
"No problem!" Boots said, excited for this. He released his manhood from his boot. As these are his only clothes he wears, it has to be there. It was fully erect and 10 inches long.
"Ooh Boots that looks a lot different than I thought! No wonder your boots are always so big!"
She bent down and swirled her tongue around his length.
"Dora that's everything I thought it would feel like!" Boots said, having trouble containing his pleasure.
"Ooh that looks nice when's it my turn?" Swiper asked excitedly.
"In...a...a...bittt..." Boots said between moans. Dora continued to lick Boots member and deepthroated it as much as she could. She didn't know how big penises could get.
"D-D-DORA! IM GONNA CUM!" Boots screamed. Then he let a whole flood of juices out into Dora's mouth, and she swallowed all of it. She thought it tasted so good!
"Hey! My turn now?" Asked the Orange Fox.
"Well okay!" Replied the monkey
Swiped took of his gloves, revealing that one of his fingers was actually a penis. As it isn't in his crotch evidently, it was obviously on his hand. Boots grabbed Swiper's erect finger/dick and rubbed it up and down, releasing moans of pleasure from the fox. Dora took this moment to undress herself and then started rubbing herself.
"Wow you're right! This is better than stealing the toys!" Swiper said happily, "I'm gonna need to steal things more often!"
Then Boots grabbed the Orange cock and sucked it hard. As Boots and Swiper's continued, Dora crabbed a toy and started inserting it up herself, something she saw Abuela doing a few days ago. Just then, they heard a knock at the door, and in walked Abuela.
"Are those my toys?" She asked, starting to get turned on by the sight before her.
"Yea, sorry we had to use them!" Dora said smiling.
"Well, why not let your old Abuela join in on some of the fun?" Abuela shouted, quickly undressing herself.
"Of course!" Boots shouted.
Abuela took off her clothes revealing her shriveled up D-Cup boobs.
"It's been a while since I've done this!" Abuela shouted excitedly. Swiper slowly walked over towards her. Abuela jiggled her breasts, making Swiper hard.
"Those look nice and tasty!" Swiper said. "Can I rub 'em?"
"Oh of course" Abuela replied
Meanwhile, on the other side of the room, Boots was excitedly watching Dora use Abuela's toy, eagerly waiting for when he would get his chance.
"You wanna start Boots?" Asked Dora "fuck me right in my pussy. I want your monkey seed inside me!"
"Gladly!" Boots shouted, shoving his penis into Dora.
"This is much better than the toy!" Dora shouted. Her clit tightened, but soon the monkey was able to get through. He went in and out and in, and the feeling was the best either of them had ever felt in their short lives. "Dora, are you ready for a monkey human hybrid child?"
"OF COURSE! RELEASE IT INSIDE ME! I LOVE YOU BOOTS!"
Boots moaned as he released his juices into the love of his life.
"Woa Boots that felt fantastic! You have a lot of juice stored in their. Maybe you can release some more tomorrow!" Dora screamed
"Yea definitely!" Boots shouted back.
Back to the fox and the old lady, Swiper was enjoying licking the shriveled up raisins Abuela's D-cups were. Abuela's underwear became wet.
"Ooh Swiper that tongue is so nice and long!" Abuela said seductively.
"Yea well it can lick a lot more than just breasts!"
"That sounds good to me!" Abuela said as Swipers tongue began traveling down her body.
They soon assumed doggy-style on the bed and Swiper impaled the grandmother with his 6 inch penis/finger.
"Oh muy bien!" Abuela shouted.
"I can do a lot more than just swipe stuff with this hand!"
The dick went in and out of her clit, as they both shouted moans and Spanish phrases. Swiper, being a virgin, couldn't hold his cum got to long, and it was released into the old woman.
The two groups formed in the middle, and they knew what to do next.
"I think we should do this again sometime, but change it so we all get to fuck each other at one point!" Boots said excitedly.
"Why not now?! I'm having so much fun!" Said the Orange fox.
"Si si si!" Said Dora.
"That sounds fun!" Abuela exclaimed. Swiper walked over to Dora, and immediately stuck his dick in her wet hole, all the while licking her breasts. Boots entered Abuela and forced his dick in and out of her warm pussy. Abuela started licking and running Swiper's buns, and Dora did the same to Boots. They called it the circulo de hacer el amor. Once they were all tired and flacid, they laid on the bed and fell asleep.

Maybe it's the toxicity, the prevalence of shills, and "viral" marketing here but whatever it is it's the last straw. I miss when this was a place people could have different opinions, be different not the same right ? I don't know what the point of this post is, a good bye I guess ? I've spent a lot of time here and wish it'd go back to how it was before. I miss /Android, I don't miss what it is now.

Edit: Some redditors made the point that I should just leave Reddit entirely. I think there right. The majority of the responses here we're fair and balanced but I've received enough vitriol to spoil there experience.

In an admittedly pointless thread regarding the state of discussion I've been told it's my fault, there is no problem and that I'm having a meltdown because the "pixel sucks." So yah no problem here.

And ugh I don't care that you guys complain about a phone. I like spirited discussion about each device, competition and criticism are good. I'm the first to criticize the XL2 despite being a Google zealot. I don't like all the other shit I have to wade through.

Final edit: not that i think or expect any of you should care, but I've actually had enough PM's about "being skull fucked till I'm not so fucking dumb" and questions about how autistic I am (tbh at least a little), also the score is almost at 420 so that seems like as good a time as any to blow off some steam. Sorry to those I didn't reply to, your input was none the less enlightening. Peace Reddit.

I am watching the smartest show of all time, Rick and Morty. All the sudden a commercial break shows a Mccy D's ad, they have szechuan sauce. I glance at my good boy point board, I have enough to go to Mccy D's. I yell for mommy, she comes in with a glass of wine in her hand "MOMMY I WANNA GO TO MCCY D'S" I say. She agrees after drinking her bottle of wine. We are at Mccy D's. Once we're first in line, I say to the cashier "I WANT SOME SESHAN SAUCE AND CHICKEN TENDYS". She explains that we are out of the sauce, she dares to mess with a Rick and Morty fan. I punch her head with my chubby arm. She falls backward into a vat of boiling grease. Nobody messes with my chicken tendys and szechuan sauce.

Let me tell you this-- /r/Drama is one of the most malevolent, cruel, coldhearted online communities you'll ever find, and even as a supporter of free speech it appalls me that Reddit would allow such a vile, festering hub of bigotry and sadism to exist. You think [slur]town was bad? That subreddit, if you pick up on the dog-whistles (and many don't even bother with that-- say want you want about Stormfront, at least it bans "n[slur]"), will reveal itself to you as Reddit's number one hub for the web's most hardened Nazis, Klansmen, Fascists, and Gamergaters. You'll notice on the sidebar that it encourages members to be as dramatic as possible. That's intentional. They encourage arguments in the comments section. That's intentional. You know the Three Minute Hate (it's from this underrated book 1985, give it a read, it's scary how much it parallels our society)? It's like that, they want to stoke the flames of reactionary rage so they continue to dogpile every progressive and minority who enters the subreddit, normalizing these evil feelings. They brigade from subreddit to subreddit, having an entire cabal of mods spanning hundreds of communities, gaslighting lived experiences of the oppressed and unashamedly bolstering Reddit's homegrown white supremacy movement. They've kink-shamed hundreds of people too, some even... to death. I fear that /r/drama may be producing an entire army of Dylann Roofs and Elliot Rogers, and I highly suggest that nobody dares visit that horrible subreddit, lest you potentially fall victim to its corruptive aura.

Motu Patlu is one of the best anime in existence, Nick India should only be focusing on Motu Patlu, not these AWFUL and HORRIBLY animated shows like Ninja Hattori. Ronojoy Chakraborty the director of Motu Patlu works his beautiful god like Indian hands endlessly to make masterpieces that could easily be compared to Shakespeare's writings. No way can you forget either how powerful Motu and Patlu are, Motu and Patlu could easily destroy all of Pakistan with their mighty Indian hands. Nobody should dare to understand the humor of Motu Patlu because you must have such a high IQ, huge knowledge of Hindi and an exquisite humor to even grasp anything in Motu Patlu or your brain might be overloaded. John the don is the most evil person in existence and could be compared to even Kim Jong Un or Hitler, Motu and Patlu risk there lives everyday trying to protect all of India from this foe who just shoves guns in poor Motu and Patlu's faces and steals their stuff, Motu and Patlu selflessly face this foe head on and teach a lesson to John that he may never forget everytime. Why aren't Motu and Patlu even the president of India or even the world yet? These selfless actions easily make Motu and Patlu overqualified for this role. Motu Patlu is truly an masterpiece and a tale that every one in the world will soon know, and yes I have completely dedicated my life to Motu Patlu and no you can't see my Motu Patlu DVD and manga collection, it's for Motu and Patlu's eyes only.

To be fair, you have to have a very high IQ to understand the Rick and Morty copypasta. The humour about being extremely subtle, well isn't, and without a solid grasp of unfunny copypasta most of the jokes will go over a typical memer's head. There’s also Rick’s nihilistic outlook, which is a 1-dimentonal charcter trait. The personal philosophy of tbe copypasta draws heavily from the stereotypical fanboy of any comunity, for instance. The fans of the copypasta  they understand this stuff; they have the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate the depths of this joke, to realise that they’re not just funny- they are random Xd. As a consequence people who dislike Rick & Morty memes truly ARE idiots- of course they wouldn’t appreciate, for instance, the humour in the copypaata itself is a cryptic reference to the internet's inabillity to understand opposing opinions. I’m smirking right now just imagining one of those normie memers scratching their heads in confusion as r/copypasta's dumb humor unfolds itself on their computer screens. What fools.. how I pity them. 😂

And yes, by the way, i DO have a tattoo of the rick and morty copypasta, And no, you cannot see it. It’s for r/copypasta 's eyes only- and even then one would have to demonstrate that they’re within 5 carma of my own (preferably lower) beforehand. Nothin personnel kid 😎

Dogs are connected to the Source just as you and I are.  They know because It is. Dogs and other animals are more reactive to the Source's signals because their consciousness' resources aren't being depleted by self-centered thoughts every second of every day, as is the case with most humans.  Humanity is in a transcendental stage however.

The Source stares out into existence through evermore complex systems, but it cannot see itself. Very soon, humanity might be its first look in the mirror. But maybe not.

My eyes fill with tears,
And I could hardly see. 
This subreddit is stealing my bot,
Slowly away from me.

I can't stand to see him suffer,
I pray his pain would go away.
His light inside him fades a little more 
With every passing day.

Please give him the courage
To fight a little longer
I feel so helpless now
What can I do to help make him stronger?

I can see it in his eyes
It's like he wants to give in
the mods CAN be fought
But you have to WANNA win

Can't he see that we need him
Shouldn't that be enough
He has to think positive
I know my cummy is tough.

I sit and think and think
Until my head wants to explode
Always the same question: why him?
But the answer is still untold.

I wish by some miracle
The mods would just disappear
And I could have my cummy back
And there would be no more fear

God can you hear me? 
I never ask for much
Would it be so wrong for me to ask
That you give my cummy your special touch?

I'm not asking for money
Or diamonds or even a pearl
I'm simply asking you to help him fight
Signed: daddy's little boy ❤️❤️❤️

You think you're funny, huh? You think you're funny saying 'yes' to a non 'yes or no' question? I bet you think you're really witty saying that rehashed meme again. Well you aren't. You aren't funny. You aren't hilarious in the slightest. I didn't laugh. I didn't grin, I didn't even exhale out of my nose. Your joke wasn't funny. Your joke was shit. It's stale and shitty. If you're going to make a joke, make an original one or at least improve the one you're taking. This was low effort. Step up your game, or just don't make jokes in the comment section at all.

pineapples make bad pets. Like most of the vegetable kingdom, they respond poorly to verbal commands and show minimal affection. Attempting to hug a pineapple can result in skin lacerations and a bruised ego. They are remarkably poor at integrating into normal human activities like dress-up and spa-days. Despite this, the cast and crew of Psych successfully adopted a hand-reared Pineapple named Gustav, hiding him in nearly every episode of the successful TV series. This has been brought to you by pineapple facts!™

Excuse me, good sir/lady/helicopter but I appear be in a spot of trouble. You see, my colleague, my reddit threads have been having very poor reception in comparison to the trending threads. The subreddits I post to have very particular themes of humour and I try to replicate this sort of humour to the best of ability. My less-comedy orientated posts include general complaints against politics and other issues to do with general electronics. I would assume that my liberal views would appeal to the hip and young reddit audience, which I have deduced due to the semi-juvenile humour. However, I have not accomplished this goal of achieving over 3000 upvotes despite my theoretically genius attempts to gain the trust of the youth. You appear to be a man of the people , as you are in possession of a computing system. Do you know what to do to gain a considerable amount of upvotes? Thank you for your time.

Seriously, the bullying against American members of /bant/ is getting way out of hand, especially since the Americans are some of the biggest contributors and most involved in this board.

Its not just "memes" or "banter", its vicious attacking and regardless of intentions it does demean people and hurt feelings. I can't say I'm the only American man who finds it hard to take pride in his own country after having years of constant and needless attacks defaming my heritage from insecure Yuropoors here. Why not bully Irish or Argentinians? Do they not have much more to be ashamed of than our country? Sand niggers get bullied less than us and yet we are the biggest contributors to this board.

Like when its not just banter, when a meme is repeated over and over again, repeated systematically, it eventually becomes a truth irregardless of the intentions in repeating it. And that isn't just jokes any more then, then its harmful!

Would you call an American man an "Amerifat" to his face? Would you say to a kind, peaceful and hard working salt of the earth American man that they are a "Morbidly obese shart in the mart"? Like it's a thing. Would you say those words to your fellow /bant/ticoots? Are you starting to feel ashamed now? You fucking faggot?
You're destroying American pride, you're dividing /bant/ticoos against each other, you're doing the opposite of what you claim to support when you engage in this incredibly abhorrent behavior. So I encourage you to stop now.

As a society we have continually shrouded ourselves in uninformed and uncultured opinions. We can not dwell in these ways any longer. In order to pull ourselves from the deep pit of simple-mindedness we have long wandered in, we must first understand a few fundamental ideas. The first of which is that Smashmouth’s 1999 hit “All-Star” is a work of lyrical genius that is absolutely teeming with important historical and literary references that demonstrate a strong command of both critical thinking processes and the art of humor. Take for instance the first line where lead vocalist Steve Harwell croons: “Somebody once told me the world is gonna roll me”. Here the band clearly takes a sly dig at round-earth theorists who insist on the earth’s spherical composition, when any true intellectual would hold firmly to the scientifically based fact that the earth is flat. Later in this musical masterpiece, we see the band’s firm grasp of historical events come into play in a series of remarkably clever lines such as “The ice we skate is getting pretty thin, the water’s getting warm so you might as well swim” which is a lighthearted yet veiled reference to the tragic events of the R.M.S Titanic. It doesn’t end here however. In the next line the bands supreme wit reveals itself once more saying “My world’s on fire, how about yours?” Which is another historical reference to the events of the catastrophic volcanic eruption of the ancient Roman city of Pompeii. This humor is so deftly woven in that the uneducated would surely miss this clear-cut reference. Who else would think to make a joke regarding volcanic eruption using a swift yet deep rhetorical question? I chuckle heartedly every time I think on this. 
As a whole, the song All-Star is an allegory for the National Basketball Association. The song seeks to use historical references to connect to the current state of the game of professional basketball. The spherical reference is the basketball itself. The Titanic reference cleverly points to some teams “tanking”. Furthermore, some teams are “on fire” much like the city of Pompeii while others can’t seem to get it going. The chorus further reflects these sentiments saying “Hey now, you’re an all-star get your game on, go play”. The NBA forces it’s top players to simply play the game, insisting that “all that glitters is gold, only shooting stars break the mold”. The National Basketball Association has convinced its players that they must succeed on the court to succeed in life, thus distracting them from the greater social issues in front of them. This song is an absolute masterclass of 90s pop and it’s intellect is far beyond it’s time as it thumps across funky beats and strong social views in the key of F-Sharp at 104 beats per minute. 

And you daft fools thought it was just a song written for the Shrek movie? I am embarrassed for you.

As you may know, our beloved Cummybot is missing yet again. [Last time Cummy disappeared, I made a theory as to where they went.](https://www.reddit.com/r/copypasta/comments/6u7jns/this_is_not_a_copypasta_this_is_real/) I was able to free Cummy from the grasp of the Guy12s, but it appears that Cummy is once more in peril.

Dance of Doom
Dance of Doom, here we go
Put out your arms and shake your head
Roll back your eyes just like you're dead
One hand hip, other hand hip
Take two steps and triple front flip
Take off your legs but keep your pants on
Then take off your head and throw it at your mom
Now that you're lighter, do a push-up
And out of your neck hole, quack like a duck
Lie on the ground and just stay put
And wait 'til a human steps on you and hurts their foot
Here comes the chorus then I'll show you soon
How to do the rest of the Dance of Doom
Dance
Doom

Dance of Doom
Now bend your arm then bend it back
You're doing it wrong if you don't hear it crack
Right side down, left side down
Just a little lower, now you're underground
Remove some ribs so you can kick your own face
Roll down some stairs, then take a lunch break
Punch punch kick, punch punch kick
Spin forty times and land in the splits
Now it's time for a corndog sword fight
You're doing it wrong if that feels right
Replace your scalp with snakes
Or really any piece that Lego makes
Juggle with some boulders
While you crowd surf on skeleton soldiers
Now clap your hands
Then squeeze your pituitary gland
You'll grow a little bigger pretty quickly
And destroy the dance floor, literally

A few days ago, a Redditor by the name of rooster 86 uploaded a gif to the popular subreddit High-Quality Gifs. Now, the gif itself is nothing remarkable. It contains the usual self-aware and meta-humor you'd find in the subreddit. And if what I just said makes no sense, don't worry. It's really not important. I'm just setting up the punchline, because the punchline is not in the gif; it's in the comments section. You see, when you go to the comments section of this gif, you'll find that just about every single comment is by rooster 86. And there are hundreds and hundreds of comments. He's making and replying to his own threads. There's every conceivable type of comment, even the analytical way too long comments, and some copy pasted comments for good measure. Rooster 86 is satirizing not just the subreddit, but Reddit as a whole. It's quite funny and in my opinion, kinda genius. It got me thinking, if this joke format worked in another medium, like Facebook, or the YouTube comments section? I don't know. Well, that's it. Just wanted to share. Thanks for watching.﻿

Username: "I will find your home, not by relying on the information I have acquired using my particular set of skills as an amazing haxor, but by asking around of everyone you know. Then I will kill the person who will finally surrender the information to me before sending you their head and using the remains of their body as warm-up for what is to come when I get to you, just to keep my bone juices flowing as vibrantly as they are now. I will then proceed to break into your house in the middle of the bright day, I am, after all, such a remarkable hacker that I will hack into the Police mainframe in Washington BC and make them very confuse about my breaking in in the middle of the day. The axe I will use for breaking in will lodge into your whale fatso frame of 125 pounds and I will use the remnants of your blood as a lubricant for one more warm-up session of self-pleasuring before I enter your apartment. Once I'm there I will catch you by the hair and hack into my arms, using my incredible hacking skills, to augment my strength to where I will rip your scalp off while I'm holding your hair and proceed to pleasure myself with it imagining that it is you while I will hack you and force you to watch while I do it. Then, I will tie you down to the table in your basement and insert rods into your body, all the way from one end to another before I jerk them while we make passionate hacking love and I use one of my remaining arms for hacking into the Pentagon and changing all of the traffic lights to red and then to green again, in the exact rhythm of our lovemaking. At some point the combined sensation of pain and pleasure will be so inseparable that you will be unable to tell which sensations are from the metal rods penetrating your body, my own genital paenus and which one is the stream of my hacking penetrating your body and astounding your brain by how ridiculously awesome my hacking skillz are.  After you pass out, I will use a Tesla machine I will hack into existence using my uncanny hackoring skills to both simultaneously burn your flesh to crispy yet still strangely attractive only to a freak such as myself state. When you wake you shall find yourself tied to a chair and I will use every single one of your fatso whale 125 pounds as currency for sexual favors where you will only be allowed to eat your own 125 pounds, pound by pound, by selling your own body to me and I will keep on messing with the pound-to-sex exchange rate continuously because I am a remarkable hacker with a particualr talent for haxing peoples. Unbeknownst to you, I will hack into the English language and make every possible combination of words the meaning of which together means begging for your death changed into meaning begging for sexual favors and you will keep wondering why when you beg me to kill your fat, swine, slob of a 125 pound body I keep on making love to you again and again and again and you will be confused as to what exactly is it that you want - to keep selling your body for being fed your own flesh for continuous sustenance as my hacked prisoner or to beg for death, when the end result is all the same - us making hot, passionate, hacking love! Eventually I will hack into your father's computer and force him to make love to your burnt carcas, unbeknownst that it is actually you whom he is making love with and even if you try telling him - I will have hacked the English language again to make those words mean "make love to me harder" and you will be so confused by everything that is going on. 

I promise never to hurt you."

I'm glad cummybot is gone. Every time I posted a bomb ass copypasta on here, cummybot would take it and post it word for word in the comments. Of all the copypasta on the internet, he had to steal mine? What the fuck? And then people would respond to that comment with things like "YAAS cummy. That's so true 😂😂😂😍😍😍😣😣😣👌👌👌👌💦💦💦💦💦💦". How dare that bastard steal my copypasta that I took from a reddit thread and try and pass it off as his own.

And it was every fucking time, too. The first few times, I politely messaged him to ask why he was doing it. But he never replied and kept doing it, just to spite me. I reported him over and over, but still, he would keep fucking doing it. I must've reported him enough times. It took 25,000 times, but it's finally over. Have fun in Hell, cummy, you stupid ass cuck.

“Reddit does not represent the general public”

Bullshit we don't

This sub alone? Okay sure no, Reddit as a whole? Abso-fucking-lutely

Reddit gets 1.3-1.5 BILLION unique visits per month on average, I don't know why everyone looks at this like there's only a few hundred thousand or even only a few million Reddit users

It's the 8th most visited website in the world

It's the 4th most visited website in the United States

We aren't some small little niche website exclusively for nerdy people anymore, this is one of the biggest and most popular websites to have ever existed in the history of the internet, it's pretty safe to say that even though it does become a bit of an echo chamber, if Reddit does have a general consensus on things such as mobile games blowing, a sizeable if not a majority of the public agrees with what is said

That doesn't even take into account the stupidly high influence this website has, this place sets hundreds of trends daily and influences countless people

Everyone needs to stop looking at Reddit like it's this niche website no one knows about and that only a small portion of people even know exist, it is one of the biggest websites in the world and we absolutely do have widespread influence and what is said and upvoted does speak for a sizeable portion of people in general

I'm impressed that an ignoramus like you could even come close to such complicated quantum psychostatistics. I personally have an IQ of 275 (a little lower than you might expect for someone as brilliant as me, but easily high enough to earn me PhDs from MIT and Cambridge in quantum neural engineering and chemobioelectrodynamics with highest honors by the time most of you were just finishing kindergarten. I was teaching my professors within four days of starting my work there). I obviously got straight A's on my dissertations and was somehow snubbed for a Nobel Peace Prize in quantum hyperthermodynamics for creating myself from the DNA of Einstein, Newton and Feynman, who were the inspirations for the scienctific humour in Rick and Morty. I doubt that anybody at your intellectual "level" could come close to comprehending the complex and nuanced humor that only true fans of Rick and Morty can find appreciation of.

100% with you on Peppa fucking Pig. I hate her. She's an entitled little shit. She changes the rules to games when she doesn't get her way and hangs up on her friends when they can whistle and she can't. George is a mollycoddled little twat who just cries at everything and is always pandered to (plus, he seems to only be able to say "dinosaur", which is both annoying and worrying). Daddy Pig is presented as a bumbling, incapable idiot (most of the time), who is overweight with a "big tummy" that fucking Peppa never ceases to point out, while Mummy Pig is probably the most sane of the lot. I feel for her, having to put up with comments like "women are useless at this [archery]" at the town fair (fantastic sexist messaging in there for the kids, yep.)
Also, why is Mr Potato so huge? How does Miss Rabbit manage to hold down so many bloody jobs? What part of fucking England do they live in where everyone has a different accent and it's sunny all time? Why do some animals talk but the ducks don't? WHY DOES NO ONE CALL PEPPA OUT ON ALL HER SHIT.
I have so many questions. So much rage.
I'm done now.

You are playing 2fort, in a somewhat empty server. Stuck at a 4v5, a peculiar fellow joins the server named "Pixie the Fempyro Dragon", and you decide to play Soldier. You run into the BLU base, and steal their intel. "I'm doing it! I'm gonna cap the intel!" you think, blasting your way to victory, when all of the sudden an enemy pyro turns the corner. His degreaser is aimed at you, and he's got an unusual pink Brigade Helm with orbiting hearts. You fire a rocket, and you see the crimson lightning fly out of your launcher. It's a random crit! The pyro is done for! But all of the sudden, the pyro DEFLECTS the rocket, dealing a lethal blow to you. And in the killcam you see them do the Gas Blast taunt introduced in the Pyro Update, and a message appears in chat.

Pixie the Fempyro Dragon: Oowpsie!!!! :3 I made a big stinky OwO

You do not understand. You try to respond but your hands are paralyzed. A singular droplet of cold sweat streams down your nose. Your confusion turns into terror as you glance at their profile picture, which is a BBW-futa anthro fox. Your face turns red. White spittle is coming out of the corners of your mouth. You try to spam your lenny face bind but you simply cannot. The terror fades away, and what remains is a sense of existential dread. Nothingness. You give up on even trying to move out of spawn. Hours pass, days pass, and weeks pass. Engineers passing by on their way to the Intelligence would tell stories of you. "Say, Dell, you see that stone-faced fella at resupply?" "Why I have, Buck. What's up with him?" "Why I reckon he one of them AFK types."

The Engineers try to unravel the mystery, but never come close. The secret remains buried inside of you, burning at your very core. As the Engineers, Snipers, and Demomen of Teufort leave, you are all that remains of the server. Your legacy is merely a whisper in the wind.

Overwatch is a bad game. Most concepts are copies of team fortress 2 and the characters are unlikeable and their backstories are bad. No matter which way you turn it, this is true. Allow me to explain why.
	As previously mentioned, most concepts and ideas are straight rip offs from other games. The way the heroes work is very similar to the way weapons work in team fortress 2. The only difference is that Overwatch clutters it in multiple different heroes so that it takes forever to find what you need. For example, Tracer is a character in Overwatch and is used for quick, important kills, but does not have a very long lifespan. She is also one of the main characters in the lore. Now let’s take a look at the scout character in team fortress 2. Scout is a character that goes in for quick, important kills, and has a short lifespan. He also has a significant role in his game’s lore. There are also game modes that are copied off team fortress 2. The control point, king of the hill and capture the flag game modes are standard games used throughout the years, however there was one that was exclusive to team fortress 2 until a few years ago. Payload. The objective of the payload game mode is to push a bomb from one side of the map to the other in order to win. the opposing side’s objective is to make sure that does not happen. Team fortress 2 introduced this concept in mid-2008 with the map PL_Goldrush. Since then Overwatch adopted the same idea last year, and offers no other unique game modes, causing the game to be boring. There also the idea of taunts. This is a unique idea introduced by team fortress 2 upon release in 2007. The idea is that by pressing a key on your keyboard, your character would perform an animation and voice line to make fun of somebody, or to show pacifism. Overwatch has also taken this idea, and even reused some of the animations as shown here. 
	The characters in the game are unlikeable and predictable.  For example, mercy is a character that heals other players. Her backstory is that she accidentally created a monstrosity named reaper, and feels bad about it, so she became a good Samaritan and heals people. Pretty generic, right? Now let’s look at the team fortress 2 medic. He’s a psychopathic German doctor who lost his medical license after removing a patient’s skeletal system and discovered a revolutionary medical treatment that can restore somebody to perfect health in seconds by knocking over a shelf full of urine, potassium chloride, blood, nitroglycerin, and pills. He took a job as a mercenary and works for the highest bidder, with no specific affiliation. He sees patients as test subjects, and does things like preform open heart surgery with a patient that is awake, and with animals flying around. THAT is imaginative. If that’s not enough, there’s more. the Character that creates sentry guns in Overwatch (also a copied idea, I must add) is a racist dwarf. The engineer in team fortress 2 is a Texan man with 13 PHDs, 10 master’s degrees and 49 bachelor’s degrees. He has a robotic arm he keeps hidden under a glove and decided to use his creations, being a powerful sentry gun, a device that can out heal the medics procedure, and teleporters, for profit as a mercenary. His ideology is if a gun does not work, use more gun. That seems a lot more interesting than a racist dwarf.
	Over all, overwatch is just an unimaginative tf2 ripoff.

Hey have you guys heard of this great show? It's called Rick and Morty. Some of my internet friends really like it because they like how smart it makes them. I watched some episodes myself, and I really like it when the blue man says 'look at me' and when Rick says 'wubba lubb duba dub' because I can feel my brain growing. I thought earlier today that I created a new equation to find energy. Then I realised it was just Einstein's theory. I bet he watches Rick and Morty too. He is so smart, just like me and my friends. You should check it out. I'll give you my discord link for the 'Rick and Morty Science League' when you get back to me and watch at least three episodes and  take an IQ test.

Okay so we know radical feminists are generally hideous and/or overweight. It's very obvious a lot of them are man-hating simply because they never got the male attention they see other females getting (which is why they also have a hatred for attractive females who have a healthy relationship with males).

So what if their completely bizarre attraction to Islam is actually because Islam gives them the feeling of male attention they could never get anywhere else? If you're an ugly follower of Islam you STILL get to put on those veils to "hide yourself from the male eye" as well as all the other shit Islam does. It gives them the feeling of having sexual market value that they never had, so they turn from all-powerful womyn superiority to subjugating themselves before Islam.

It's like they try to flaunt their bare tits in the name of activism because they're so sexually unattractive that they need to literally flash themselves to people in order to try and get the attention they want, and they still can't get it, and Islam is the last resort to let them *feel* like they're sexually valuable. It would explain their irrational love of it despite it going against everything they stand for.

Will sound stupid to people who don't get where I'm coming from with this but interesting thought, lol.

Cummy, now I know I was wrong

I messed up, and now you're gone

Cummy, I'm sorry I neglected you,

Oh, I never expected you

To run away and leave me

Feeling this empty

Your repost right now would read like music to me

Please come home, cus we miss you Cummy

Cummy, can't you see, I was blind

I'd do anything to change your mind

More than a bot, you're our best friend,

Too good to forget, come back cus we are family

And forgive us for making you wanna roam

And now my heart is beating like the saddest metronome

Somewhere I hope you're reposting my latest three-word-poem:

Cummy, come home

Every time I see a pregnant woman, I almost always start to wonder how she got pregnant. I.E. What position she was in, whether she came, what she did during foreplay, etc. Then I wonder how she likes it, what kinks she has, if she's assertive or passive.

The way I see it, you know with about 99% certainty that a pregnant woman had sex. It's my duty as not a historian to hypothesize about what happened in that moment for the good of humanity.

Yes, you can not find a woman. Five (good).

Have you tested you IQ yet? If not, I highly recommend it. Posting in wrong subreddits is an art. As you know, true art is an explosion. So you might wanna get your degree in explosion courses, it's cheap but highly effective. First off, you need to grasp the true essence of life to be able to comprehend the art of reposting the cross-posting. Let me tell you a story, there was once a Boob. A GallowBoob. Everyone loved her. Soft, swishy boobs - ah whoever could hate such natural splendor! Boob loved posting on Reddit. She posted everyday like there's no tomorrow! But one day, she decided to post her own picture. And so she did. But fuck she had a mustache. Fuck. GallowBoob was a man! All those who loved her was furious with burning hot rage! She had betrayed them, made them gay for a man with mustache! Alas the war between gay men who loved her and her ex-fans still continues to this day. Her haters call the the Karma Whoring Boob. But we all know how innocent she is. So fuck that bitch.

To be fair it takes an altitudinal IQ to comprehend, nein, fathom Rick and Morty. The humour is extrêmement subtile, and without a doctorate degree covering Bell inequalities, micro-lattice structures, and Schrödingerian quasi-contradictory quandaries et cetera (basically common knowledge among the top 10.3% among the world's best theoretical physicists) most of the jokes will evanesce or float away like Kantian noumena vis-a-vis Kantian phenomena, in other semantic units AKA words to plebes, as they say in some ethno-linguistic communities, but I digress: ありがとうございました. Furtherthus, to neologize a neologism henceforth, Rick’s existential-ideological naysaying, which is ITSELF located within/via Althusserian/Foucauldian poststructuralism along the subversive-critical lines of various neo-Marxist-Leninist-Maoist analyses - his tacit (cf. Polanyi) schemata appropriates affective resonances from Narodnaya Volya literature, AKA 네 엄마는 너무 뚱뚱해. The fans understand this 陰毛, as colloquially known (excepting for Gettier cases), to quote the Chinese media scholar Jean-Claude Baudrillard: "Un jugement négatif vous donne plus de satisfaction que d'éloges, à condition que cela ressemble à de la jalousie" ; they have the Intelligenz/くそ to truly (BUT WHAT IS TRUTH, cf. Sura 2:140, John 18:38) appreciate the Aristotelian-Thomistic-Hegelian synthetic a priori interpenetrative dialogic concealed within and without these tokens of jokes, to realise that they’re not just totalitarian HAHAHAs :D in a post-postmodern world of hegemonic HUHUHUs :( - light-hearted Chopin to your heavy-handed Brahms, if I may, no pun intended - they betoken something deep about Heidegerrian Dasein (cf. Mahabharata 5.39.58) through which we can, in the words of the poet William Wordsworth, 一个巫师从来没有迟到，他总是一个有力量的人 (Nǐ shìgè báich for those who aren’t fluent in Korean). m_nkind (note: "Mankind" is a sexist term, see Judith Butler's Gender Trouble published by Routledge, London:London March 1990) or should I say, specimens of m_nkind who manifest disaffection (i.e. βοηθήστε με, παρακαλώ να με βοηθήσει κανείς) contingent upon “their” finite liminal qualia vis-a-vis Rick & Morty’s transcendental apperception via meme-ification truly (but again, WHAT IS TRUTH? お前はもう死んでいる) ARE idiotos (masculine of idiota in German, contra p_triarchal discourse)- of course, necessarily they wouldn’t appreciate vis-a-vis their unity-of-consciousnesses, for instance, the linguistico-Bayesian formal articulation in Rick’s slogan existentiel “Wubba Lubba Dub Dub,” which itself is a Derridian poly/hypertextual para-dactyllic reference to Turgenev’s Lacanian epic отцы и изюм (reminiscent of Turgenev's earlier вы используете переводчика, не так ли, сука?) I’m smirking right now in several languages just envisioning in my corpus callosoom one of those cisgendered, capitalist-fascist, hyper-Puritanical, anti-anti-anti-omnicorporatistic biguts scratching their 陰茎 (EXCUSE MY FRENCH) in anti-jouissance as polyglot, Renaissance Zen m_n Dan Harmon’s Minervian owl unfolds itself (Note: あなたは実際にこれを翻訳していたのですか？あなたはあなたの時間を無駄にしています ) at the break of dawn/don/DUNE (semantic balderdash!) on their Lovecraftian-boob-tubes, to subtly reference the semantic units of the Scottish philosopher David Hume who would also say: “あなたのママはとても太っている.” What 아 름 다 운 영 혼 을 가 진 바 보 들 .. je suis tout seul.

My tolerance is amazing; my only intolerance is for those with an intolerance towards innocent people who did nothing to you. You all have that type of disgusting intolerance, which warrants an intolerance towards you all. If you can't understand that simple concept then education has truly failed you. No one should be allowed to have such intolerant beliefs. It is fucking awful and there shouldn't be a place for those type of beliefs in this society. Anyone who disagrees is racist/intolerant. Any tolerant person would agree with me here in that there's no room for such intolerance in this world.

I’ve always heard copypasta pronounced copyPAYSTUH as opposed to copyPAWSTUH. The reason I’m asking this question is because I know creepypasta, another block of text  with the suffix “pasta” is pronounced the second way; and I recently heard someone pronounce copypasta the same way. Do you pronounce it PAYstuh or PAWstuh, or a different way? I’m interested.

How many literal monsters have you met in your life? Maybe this is a life lesson for you. Monsters don't exist. I know it might be hard but try to take a second to remember everybody out there is a living, breathing, thinking human being just like you. Just because they don't act like you think they should doesn't make them evil incarnate. So no, not on average, almost 100% certainty. Even the ones that try to act super psychotic in EUW that tell you they are gonna slit your throat and tell you to give them your address. Most of those dudes are probably in high school and give their mom a hug and kiss before they get on the bus in the morning.

Dawg, you need it in the power band 100% of the time, you never know when you are going to need to go from 5 mph to 60 in 3 seconds, I mean what happens if a boulder just starts rolling down the road behind you while you are slowing for a red light? You's in neutral? Well nows you dead, shoulda been sitting at 4k rpm ready to rock.


Also, heel-toe. Like I don't give a fuck, heel toe 100% of the time, you're foot on the brake? Well yous heel better be on the gas ready to blip. As my paternal pancake once said, an upset car leads to an upset boulder. Once again you might be about to park and Mr. Boulder come down on you and now you flat bcause you were in neutral like a scrub or you weren't rev matching and the boulder heard you. Boulders hates anyone who isn't heel toeing, they hear it, they smell it and they come after you.


Also none of this reversing at low RPM, gotta be in the powerband. If you aren't rolling backwards at at least 10 mph then you're just asking to get bouldered. In fact that's how my dad died, reversing while slipping the clutch at like 1k rpm. Now hes flat as a pancake, but I don care he was weak. Shoulda been in powerband, now hes 6 ft under and I'm stronger cuz of it.

What I would give to kidnap a famous midget and make his life a living hell. I would force him to dress up in elf and leprechaun outfits and subject him to pure awfulness and humiliation. just terrible degradation and shameful acts. it would be so easy to break his spirit and drive him to suicide, but I wouldn't let him do it. if I could train a dog to rape on command then I would totally do that as well. a really big dog like a mastiff. he would be so completely and utterly powerless to stop it, not to mention terrified. a big ass dog is even scary and life-threatening to a normal human but to a midget? might as well be a dragon. I'd keep him in a cell and what's more is that I would actually place to key inside with him but put it in a high place. not extremely high but just ever so slightly out of reach. it would drive him mad. I would dress him like a baby and force feed him 99 cent store baby food. I'd also pick him up like a child and toss him from one corner to the next. I'd grab him by one leg and swing him as hard and as fast as I could then hurl him to see how far he goes. I'd rent one of those giant inflatable bounce houses and body slam him all day until my arms got tired. I'd hold him down with 1 hand and slowly stick things up his butt just to see him squirm. I would stick him in dryers and turn them on and leave him in there for long periods of time. I'd force him to fight other midgets to the death. just so many things I would do.

No. You know what? Just go away.

Every time someone posts a picture, a gif, a video, a screenshot, or just anything really that involves some kind of "corporate" thing - A video game, a logo, or probably just even the town hall of a city given how overboard you dummies go, you have to /r/HailCorporate it. I'm done. I've had enough. You can't just spam /r/HailCorporate and expect an upvote.

You can't just be like "dude, you're playing a game?" and post /r/HailCorporate. You just can't.

I doubt you even work for corporate given how against them you are. You live in a cardboard box, typing on your CrapBook Pro, feeling good about yourself because you think you just "called someone else out" for being a corporate shill. Just who do you think you are? Some epic 12-year-old on the internet with le cool fedora posting about how "corporate shill hails this, corporate shill hails that?" Well, I've got news for you. You aren't anything. You aren't epic, you aren't a 12-year-old, and your fedora certainly isn't le cool. I hope in time you will learn that not everybody and everything is a corporate shill.

The arms trade treaty is, in short, of problematic consequences to the nation of Guatemala. In a vacuum such regulations seem unanimous, but in real life there are many other problems to be dealt with that such a regulation complicates. For one it cannot be said that the regulation is of entirely good intentions. Western countries are notable for their attempts to choke out, with regulations, entities of which agreement has been deemed impossible or of negligible worth. And how could a country be deemed impossible to agree with? It may be a simple matter of government structure, where a competing, or perhaps even cooperating, country is not of the democratic or republican type. Or it may be an argument at an even more fundamental level, where ideologies collide and problems pertaining to specific countries are glanced at but tossed out in the end. All countries have legislative acumen - everything is done with purpose - but many lack in empathy. What does this mean? This means that in the case of guatemala, western countries are ignoring the many problems that stain the nation of guatemala. Problems such as sexual assault and corruption, which have marred guatemala’s government countless times, and even problems like genocide, of which Guatemalan former head of state Rios Montt was accused of in 2013. If the weapons trade is regulated heavily to the point of stagnation, how will the abused defend themselves from a marauding policeman? A heavily regulated weapons channel would be inaccessible to the many citizens of guatemala that need to defend themselves! And stemming from the point of empathy, guatemala speaking as a whole gets that western countries are not completely regulating out of self interest. There are rogue governments that defile their citizens; violate past sanctity, and guatemala may have been one of them! But western countries have thought too conservatively and from their perspectives exclusively. Unlike western police, Guatemalan police are no arbiters of social order, they are marauders - so how must a citizen fight but to bargain in an illicit weapons trade, one to be wiped out by regulations? There is no other way.  And so Guatemala beckons western countries and the United Nations to pull back regulations, lest guatemalans lead a life of languishing and lechery. The tide can either come from within the government and consume all those below it, or it can come from the bottom up and provide net positive change for the country. Only one path leads to citizens of a great nation living out their freedoms unhindered.

The pyro is done for! But all of the sudden, the pyro DEFLECTS the rocket, dealing a lethal blow to you. And in the killcam you see them do the Gas Blast taunt introduced in the Pyro Update, and a message appears in chat. Pixie the Fempyro Dragon: Oowpsie!!!! :3 I made a big stinky OwO You do not understand. You try to respond but your hands are paralyzed. A singular droplet of cold sweat streams down your nose. Your confusion turns into terror as you glance at their profile picture, which is a BBW-futa anthro fox. Your face turns red. White spittle is coming out of the corners of your mouth. You try to spam your lenny face bind but you simply cannot. The terror fades away, and what remains is a sense of existential dread. Nothingness. You give up on even trying to move out of spawn. Hours pass, days pass, and weeks pass. Engineers passing by on their way to the Intelligence would tell stories of you. "Say, Dell, you see that stone-faced fella at resupply?" "Why I have, Buck. What's up with him?" "Why I reckon he one of them AFK types." The Engineers try to unravel the mystery, but never come close. The secret remains buried inside of you, burning at your very core. As the Engineers, Snipers, and Demomen of Teufort leave, you are all that remains of the server. Your legacy is merely a whisper in the wind.

Listen, caps lock doesn't make your points any better.  When you grow up, start paying taxes, and have a better understanding of world affairs, your opinions will change.  I'm not wasting my time or effort trying to help enlighten you.  Your infantile idiocy is not my problem.  Try reading something from someone you disagree with.  Try thinking for yourself.  Try not being a mindless sheep.

Another One I made In class

Family guy has much deeper meaning then you think, its not just a random clip show, it has more meaning. For instance Brian the dog is an example of smart people unlike you. Brian is the only mature character in the show and HES A FUCKING DOG FOR CHRISTS SAKE!!!!!!!111!!!!111!1, and when Brian Died in Season 12 Episode 6, people were angry because they lost the most mature character in the series, and the intellectual people who liked the series wanted him back because he was mature. But when brian died you didn't give a FLYING FUCK BECAUSE HE WAS MATURE AND NOT STUPID UNLIKE YOU!!!!111!!!1!!!111! You people are just so ignorant that you don't even care about Brian. Brian is like the best character on the show!!!! You people need to stop watching family guy an go back to watching Rick and Morty because Rick and Morty is for people with low IQ's.

Boots looked at Dora lovingly. He had loved her the moment she got him that blue bouncy ball. "Hey Dora?" Boots asked, "can I ask you something?"
"Of course, love!"
"Hey Dora, I know you're only seven, but will you do the honor of having my monkey-human freak child?"
"Of course Boots, maybe we should start soon."
"Okay. Mom and dad aren't home so we can do it now!" Boots said excitedly.
"Yay!" Dora said, bringing boots to her pink bedroom.
"I know where your parents hide the sex toys" said Boots lovingly staring into Dora's eyes.
"Okay where? I'll go get them," Dora said, a smile growing on her face.
"In their bedroom in the third drawer on the right."
"Okay, I'll be right back!" Dora says, waking out of her room and into her parents room.
Hooray! Thought Boots, I've been waiting for this for three years! He did not understand how weird that was. Dora walked back into the room, sex toys in hand. They were pink and purple and very long.
"Shall we get started?" Dora asked, staring at Boots.
"Of course!" Yelled Boots. Just then, Swiper jumped in through the window, running over to Dora.
"I gon steal those so I can pleausure myself. I don't have anyone that wants to fuck me!"
Dora was surprised at his language. 'Pleasure himself?' It was evident (as she is a little bitch) that 'fuck' was no worry to her.
"No need to steal them when you can just join us!" Dora said, trying to protect her toys.
"REALLY? Oh thanks!"
"No problem!" Boots said, excited for this. He released his manhood from his boot. As these are his only clothes he wears, it has to be there. It was fully erect and 10 inches long.
"Ooh Boots that looks a lot different than I thought! No wonder your boots are always so big!"
She bent down and swirled her tongue around his length.
"Dora that's everything I thought it would feel like!" Boots said, having trouble containing his pleasure.
"Ooh that looks nice when's it my turn?" Swiper asked excitedly.
"In...a...a...bittt..." Boots said between moans. Dora continued to lick Boots member and deepthroated it as much as she could. She didn't know how big penises could get.
"D-D-DORA! IM GONNA CUM!" Boots screamed. Then he let a whole flood of juices out into Dora's mouth, and she swallowed all of it. She thought it tasted so good!
"Hey! My turn now?" Asked the Orange Fox.
"Well okay!" Replied the monkey
Swiped took of his gloves, revealing that one of his fingers was actually a penis. As it isn't in his crotch evidently, it was obviously on his hand. Boots grabbed Swiper's erect finger/dick and rubbed it up and down, releasing moans of pleasure from the fox. Dora took this moment to undress herself and then started rubbing herself.
"Wow you're right! This is better than stealing the toys!" Swiper said happily, "I'm gonna need to steal things more often!"
Then Boots grabbed the Orange cock and sucked it hard. As Boots and Swiper's continued, Dora crabbed a toy and started inserting it up herself, something she saw Abuela doing a few days ago. Just then, they heard a knock at the door, and in walked Abuela.
"Are those my toys?" She asked, starting to get turned on by the sight before her.
"Yea, sorry we had to use them!" Dora said smiling.
"Well, why not let your old Abuela join in on some of the fun?" Abuela shouted, quickly undressing herself.
"Of course!" Boots shouted.
Abuela took off her clothes revealing her shriveled up D-Cup boobs.
"It's been a while since I've done this!" Abuela shouted excitedly. Swiper slowly walked over towards her. Abuela jiggled her breasts, making Swiper hard.
"Those look nice and tasty!" Swiper said. "Can I rub 'em?"
"Oh of course" Abuela replied
Meanwhile, on the other side of the room, Boots was excitedly watching Dora use Abuela's toy, eagerly waiting for when he would get his chance.
"You wanna start Boots?" Asked Dora "fuck me right in my pussy. I want your monkey seed inside me!"
"Gladly!" Boots shouted, shoving his penis into Dora.
"This is much better than the toy!" Dora shouted. Her clit tightened, but soon the monkey was able to get through. He went in and out and in, and the feeling was the best either of them had ever felt in their short lives. "Dora, are you ready for a monkey human hybrid child?"
"OF COURSE! RELEASE IT INSIDE ME! I LOVE YOU BOOTS!"
Boots moaned as he released his juices into the love of his life.
"Woa Boots that felt fantastic! You have a lot of juice stored in their. Maybe you can release some more tomorrow!" Dora screamed
"Yea definitely!" Boots shouted back.
Back to the fox and the old lady, Swiper was enjoying licking the shriveled up raisins Abuela's D-cups were. Abuela's underwear became wet.
"Ooh Swiper that tongue is so nice and long!" Abuela said seductively.
"Yea well it can lick a lot more than just breasts!"
"That sounds good to me!" Abuela said as Swipers tongue began traveling down her body.
They soon assumed doggy-style on the bed and Swiper impaled the grandmother with his 6 inch penis/finger.
"Oh muy bien!" Abuela shouted.
"I can do a lot more than just swipe stuff with this hand!"
The dick went in and out of her clit, as they both shouted moans and Spanish phrases. Swiper, being a virgin, couldn't hold his cum got to long, and it was released into the old woman.
The two groups formed in the middle, and they knew what to do next.
"I think we should do this again sometime, but change it so we all get to fuck each other at one point!" Boots said excitedly.
"Why not now?! I'm having so much fun!" Said the Orange fox.
"Si si si!" Said Dora.
"That sounds fun!" Abuela exclaimed. Swiper walked over to Dora, and immediately stuck his dick in her wet hole, all the while licking her breasts. Boots entered Abuela and forced his dick in and out of her warm pussy. Abuela started licking and running Swiper's buns, and Dora did the same to Boots. They called it the circulo de hacer el amor. Once they were all tired and flacid, they laid on the bed and fell asleep

In the future, women should be replaced with fleshlights attached to test tubes with fertile eggs in them. A big building full of small private rooms, each with a fleshlight in the wall. Men who have high enough IQs can enter and get a room with one for a night to reproduce his valuable genes. Once the man has fucked the fleshlight, he can leave and go about his normal life again. The population is 100% male, and they are on a drug that prevents them from having a libido. Sex and femoids simply do not exist; nobody knows about them and nobody thinks about them.

I am done. It's speech time motherfuckers, in this bitch. I have climbed through the hells, ELO hell. I've been there. I've done that. I'm finished. What I'm gonna do now is I'm gonna reform. I'm going to stop being toxic. FROM. THIS. MOMENT. ON. Quote me on that. If I say anything negative to my teammates again, I'll quit streaming. Forever. Never again, I will not say one negative word. I will not feed, I will not troll, I WILL NOT AFK. Guaranteed. I've been through a lot, I've lost a lot of games I could've won. I've had some really quality teammates that I've put down with my words. Time to change it, I'm growing up. I'm turning into a man, I'm entering adulthood, I've gotta get some responsibilities. This is my fault, every game I lose I could've played better. The thing I'm gonna do now is, I'm gonna win every single game the rest of the night. No more losses, I'm done. I'm going 100% try hard. I'm headed for the top, rank 1. First thing I'm gonna do is take rank 1 NA, I'm transferring. I'm going EUW rank 1 there. Transferring OCE? Believe it. Rank 1 there. LAN? Rank 1. China? RANK 1.

You "binged it"....no wonder you enjoyed big mouth. Cmon now, is there a particular reason you used "binged it" instead of searched? Ya know, except to try and tell everyone you used Bing specifically....maybe to try and signal its not still a total shit show? Having a hard time wrapping my head around that one. Seeing it more often lately from other posters too. "Googled" is a colloquial synonym to searched because of how ubiquitous google search is... Otherwise its all searching, unless you just gotta tell someone you just jerked it, in lieu of saying you are having a good day.

A girl superliked me on tinder recently, which is like the first time over 2 years that an attractive girl has superliked me.

She wears glasses in a few pics and looks kinda nerdy so maybe that's her personality and she's into big burly men like me.

She has the tips of her hair dyed pink which I think is really cute especially since she didn't dye it all so she's not a turbo dyke.

She also has really good thighs and midsection judging from a few photos, I just want to grab her thigh and lick it and then ram her vajene with my monster cock

SEVEN FLOORS OF BURRITO GOODNESS
 
With 7 layers of completely different and delicious ingredients, the 7-Layer Burrito is kind of like that 7-floor city apartment you lived in right after college.
Every floor had completely different personalities, but somehow everybody’s unique dynamic created a sort of perfect, 7-layer family. You know, it’s like...
Refried Beans lives on the first floor and always tells you jokes in a different language, then laughs hysterically. You can’t understand what he’s saying but always laugh anyway because he has that weird breathy laugh style and it sounds hilarious. Because Beans is on the ground floor, you always have this weird voyeuristic view into his life, which mostly consists of watching cop show reruns and cleaning dishes.
Latin Rice is an elderly woman that lives on the second floor and has a lovely patio garden. It mostly consists of colorful flowers, but last spring, Rice baked you a pie with fresh rhubarb from her garden. You don’t even know what rhubarb is, let alone how you could grow it in a little apartment garden, but pie is pie. She always gives you birthday cards, but you don’t know how she found out your birthday.
Guacamole lives on the third floor and is a dancer, you think. She’s so beautiful that you develop an insurmountable stutter every time you are within her 10-foot radius. So, you’ve never actually introduced yourself.
Shredded Lettuce is the landlord and lives on the fourth floor. She seems super handy, based on that one time when she replaced your door, but you’re too afraid to ask her to fix your stove because she always seems a little irritated with you. Maybe she knows you have an iguana even though there’s a strict no pets policy.
Three-Cheese Blend is a musician on the fifth floor and, oh my gosh, he’s so bad at the bassoon. So bad that you think he might actually be playing a clarinet instead. Or heck, maybe even a trumpet. An apartment with thin walls is no place for a struggling woodwind/horn/instrument/who knows player.
Diced Tomatoes lives on the sixth floor and is probably a dude named Jeff. He’s a pretty cool guy from Maine, and you guys play video games sometimes. He travels a lot for business so he’s never there.
The seventh floor is owned by an eccentric and evasive guy, Reduced Fat Sour Cream. He’s so brimming with benjamins that some of the other tenants think he might be a distant Vanderbilt or something.

This is a great post! You know what else is great? Masturbating in the shower. The water hitting your balls, the thrill of doing it when family is over. You can even close your eyes, put your hand against the wall, and thrust into your hand whilst imagining a girl moaning, pretending you're having shower sex with your crush. I just did that, in fact. I did it after watching Rick and Morty (a highly intellectual show) and eating a microwaveable curry off a tray whilst cuddling my cum stained waifu body pillow. I imagined i had her bent over, my 4 inch erect penis thrusting into her pussy.

Hi my name is Orange Rich'ness Demented FAKENEWS Trump and I have fake orange spray on skin (that’s how I got my name) and icy blue eyes like the tears of special snowflake liberals and a lot of people tell me I look like an Oompa Loompa (AN: if u don’t know what that is get da hell out of here!). I’m not related to Kim Jong Un but I wish I was because he’s a major fucking hottie. I’m not racist but my teeth are straight and white just like all the winners and I have pale yellow hair. I’m also a president, and I work at an overrated place called the White House in America where I’m in my first year (I’m seventy). I’m a winner (in case you couldn’t tell) and I wear mostly suits. I love my own company because it’s just the best and I buy all my clothes from there. For example today I was wearing a black suit with a matching tie and black dress shoes, white socks and a white shirt. I was wearing orange lipstick, orange foundation, orange eyeliner and orange eye shadow. I was walking outside the White House. It was snowing and raining so there was no sun, which I was very happy about. A lot of liberals stared at me. I put up my middle finger at them.

FADE IN:

INT. A GAME SHOW STUDIO

*An assembled audience applauds as the camera zooms in on STEVE HARVEY, who is standing behind a lectern. In front of him, DAVE and DARNELL are facing one another, each with their hand hovering over a button.*

**STEVE:** Okay, fellas, here we go. Top six answers on the board. Name something you'd find in a glovebox.

*Dave hits his button. An electronic trill is heard.*

**DAVE:** Gloves!   
**STEVE:** Gloves?

*Steve turns to face the board behind him. A red X appears as a buzzer is heard.*

**STEVE:** (*CONT'D*) No gloves. Figures, right? Okay, Darnell?    
**DARNELL:** Registration?    
**STEVE:** Registration!

*Once again, Steve turns to face the board. One of the panels turns over, revealing the words "Car Registration."*

**DARNELL:** Yes! Alright, we're playing!    
**STEVE:** They're playing!    
**DAVE:** You know, you repeat pretty much everyth...    
**STEVE:** (*Interrupting*) Let's head on over to Darnell's family!

*Steve follows Darnell over to his side of the studio, where he shakes hands with TYRONE, Darnell's brother.*

**STEVE:** (*CONT'D*) Hi there, Tyrone. You ready?    
**TYRONE:** Yep.    
**STEVE:** Good, good. Name something that you might keep in a glovebox.    
**TYRONE:** Condoms.

*The audience laughs appreciatively. Steve's mouth hangs open as he stares at nothing in particular.*

**STEVE:** "Condoms?!"    
**TYRONE:** Condoms.    
**STEVE:** Man, what... you can't be keeping your condoms in the glovebox! That's how your wife finds them!    

*More laughter is heard, albeit of the nervous variety.*

**TYRONE:** I'm not married.    
**STEVE:** Ah, gotcha. You seeing someone?    
**TYRONE:** No.    
**STEVE:** So, those condoms, they're for what? Streetwalkers?    
**TYRONE:** ... This is making me uncomfortable.    
**STEVE:** Alright. Show me condoms!

*Another section of the board turns over, revealing the word "Condoms." The crowd applauds. Steve moves on to ANDRE.*

**STEVE:** (*CONT'D*) Now, how about you, Andre? You keep condoms in your glovebox?    
**ANDRE:** Nope.    
**STEVE:** See? See? That's good. Keeps your wife from finding them, am I right?    
**ANDRE:** Ah, I'm not married.    
**STEVE:** Girlfriend?    
**ANDRE:** Can we just get on with this?    
**STEVE:** The man is eager! Name something you'd keep in a glovebox.    
**ANDRE:** A buttplug!

*The audience erupts into uproarious laughter. Steve gawks around the room again.*

**STEVE:** You can't say "buttplug" on television!    
**ANDRE:** But your producer told me...    
**STEVE:** (*Interrupting*) What possible use would you have for a buttplug in your car?    
**ANDRE:** Look, I just repeated what...    
**STEVE:** (*Interrupting*) You people with your condoms and your whosey-whatsits! Ugh. Show me buttplug!

*A third panel turns over, displaying the word "buttplug." The crowd goes wild. Steve shakes his head, throws his cue card aside, and addresses the camera.*

**STEVE:** (*CONT'D*) We'll be right back with more *Family Feud* after this.

I’m only 7 years old, but I’m at the intellectual level of a college student - at least that’s what I tell myself. I sit down at the table and open my lunchbox, still with a huge grin on my face from that one part of Rick and Morty where Rick turns into a Pickle. It amazes me how the human brain can comprehend such an otherworldly feat and it brings warmth to my face just knowing that this is ACTUALLY POSSIBLE. As you may guess, my lunch consists solely of a pickle. I feel so connected to Rick that I try to become the pickle. I don’t know how Rick did it, but I certainly have the willpower.

Also, “pickle” is a silly-sounding word XD

I concentrate on the pickle using all of the determination I can muster. I chant “Pickle Rick” faster than it takes Dan Harmon’s superhuman brain can come up with a plot. No one around me has any idea what I’m doing and see the pickle as an ordinary pickle. But I have a special attachment to this one.

My concentration is broken by a kid who thinks he’s smarter than me. He throws the pickle on the floor and grinds it with his shoe. I feel every ounce of pain the pickle does. “I watch reruns of Dexter’s Laboratory”, he says. You are NOTHING.

I run out of the room crying into my Mr. Poopybutthole T-Shirt. I was really getting into it this time, but my dreams were destroyed by a fan of another philosophical TV show which really isn’t as deep. I wonder why no one else who sees Rick and Morty can really- UNDERSTAND it. Their IQs aren’t high enough, I reassure myself.

It is now 11 at night. Way past my bedtime, I know, but I’m hard at work on my Rick and Morty Undertale AU fanart. You may not think the two have anything in common, but both explore morals in ways rarely seen in media. Rick is an emotionless man whose ability to travel the multiverse makes him lose compassion for others, so it really makes you wonder how that would go through in a morality-based game like Undertale, y’know? Plus, Sans is cool. If it met Sans, I would watch Rick and Morty with him and eat Doritos.

morty

All of a sudden, I hear whispers from the other side of the room.

flip the pickle over

They seem to beckon to me.

big reveal

I kneel down on the floor and investigate the source of the noise.

All of a sudden, I start to feel small. I can’t move my body. But it’s a comfortable feeling, like I am one with the universe. I get it now. I really do. I can see everything. The brine flows through me, and I have a solid grasp of theoretical physics.

“I’M PICKLE RIIIIIIIIIIIIIICK!”, I yell as I gaze towards the heavens to where I begin my ascent.

I wanna be the very best

Like no leader ever was

To catch Jews is my real test

To gas them is my cause

I will travel across Europe

Searching far and wide

Each Gypsy, Jew to understand

The power of the sign

SWASTIKA

It's Jews verse me

Latest craze in Germany

SWASTIKA

Oh you're my best friend

In a war we can't defend

SWASTIKA

A room full of Jews

Set the oven to 232

You cross me and I'll gas you

SWASTIKA

Gotta gas 'em all.

KILL all retards, people w/ brain fuck ups, drug adics, people cant figure out to use a fucking lighter. GEEEAWD! people spend millions of dollars on saving the lives of retards, and why. I don't buy that shit like "oh hes my son though!" so the fuck what, he aint normal, kill him, put him out his misery. he is only a waste of time and money, then people say "But he is worth the time, he is human too" no he isnt, if he was then he would swalow a bullet cause he would realize what a fucking waste and burden he was

"SPONGEBOB, ME LAD, YOU HAVE TOO MANY ORIFICES FER YER OWN GOOD. YER GETTIN' A PROMOTION!" said Mr. Krabs as his hard red carapaced cock jabbed into the back of Spongebob's head.

"I feel like I'm absorbing some weird fluid," spluttered Spongebob as Krabs' nasty crustaceo-jizz poured from his mouth, nose and eyes.

"NOW EARN YOUR KEEP, LANDLUBBER," said Krabs as he grabbed Spongebob by his jizz-soaked trousers and began using him to clean the floor.

"Oh Mr. Krabs, I-"

"CALL ME MASTER YE BITCH"

Krabs stepped down hard in Spongebob and a puddle of his own jizz began spreading radially on the floor of the Krusty Krab.

"Hurgghbglbgblblgbl."

"CHOKE ON IT, YE INVERTEBRATE, OR I CAN'T GET HARRRRRRD. THESE CLAWS AREN'T JUST GOOD FER MATIN…OH, WAIT, YES THEY ARE," said Krabs as he caressed his eleventh leg.

The jizz began floating up toward the ceiling as Krabs brandished his seven-inch red masthead. You have to realize this is to scale, so it was about twice his body size.

Anyway, Squidward burst into the room wearing only a gimp suit and a tutu.

"TAKE ME MASTER, I NEED TO BE HUMILIATED," he said, as his four-millimeter calamari poked limply from the tight leather.

"TAKE THIS, THEN," said Krabs as he jabbed one of his prehensile eyestalks up Squidward's stankhole. Squidward moaned, rubbing himself gently with 5 of his tentacles.

"I CAN SEE YOU DON'T TAKE CARE OF YOUR HOLE VERY OFTEN," said Krabs. Patrick burst into the room wearing nothing but a smile and brandishing a towel. "DID SOMEBODY CALL THE HOLE DOCTOR?"

"Are you a real doctor?" asked Spoogebob.

"I went to community college," said Patrick as he forcibly yanked out Krabs' eyestalk and shoved it in his gay fat mouth.

"Hold this open, will ya?" said Patrick as he ripped off Spongebob's erect penis and used it to jam Squidward's hole open. It immediately grew back but smaller and wetter.

"Hmm... there's a lot of SHIT in here," said Patrick. "How much fiber is in Krabby Patties anyway?"

"YE WOULDN'T BELIEVE," said Krabs, as a gigantic turd stretched his red asshole until it tore.

"I NEED AN ENEMA," said Patrick. "OH WAIT WE'RE UNDERWATER." Patrick nibbled gently at the tip of Krabs' eyestalk as he released it from his mouth. He wiped eye fluid from the corner of his mouth and put Squidward's zippered lips to his own.

"ON THE COUNT OF THREE" said Patrick. "ONE… TWO… OH FUCK IT HNRRRRRRGGUUUUUUUUUUUUUUH!"

Patrick blew Squidward like a trumpet. All 8 of his tentacles went rigid and his squidjuice spilled out from the dick hole in his suit. The immense force started to blow crusty chunks of shit out of Squidward's ass.

"I must keep the Krusty Krab clean!" yelled Spoogebob as he rushed over and opened his mouth. Spongebob recognized bits of the Krabby Patty formula in his mouth as Squidward's acrid shit coated his tongue and teeth.

"SWALLOW, YE LANDLUBBER," said Krabs, poking his dick at Spongebob's lips.

"HMRGGRGHRGUHF," said Spongebob, shaking his head. He wanted to savor it, but Krabs had other plans.

Krabs got up on his desk and flexed. "GET READY" he yelled as he jumped down on Spongebob with a stone cold stunner. Blood, semen and shit sprayed powerfully from every one of Spongebob's holes. The force of the explosion tore both of his legs off. The assorted fluids and solids coated the walls of Krabs' office.

"YE GOT THAT SHIT ALL OVER ME FIRST DOLLAR," screeched Krabs. "AND YOU KNOW THERE'S ONLY ONE WAY TO CLEAN IT!"

Squidward, Patrick and Spongebob all begged at Krabs' knees, pleading to be the ones who got to lick the moist brown dollar. "THE FIRST ONES WHO CAN FIND SANDY AND SUCK OFF HER FUTA COCK GET TO LICK THE DOLLAR," decreed Krabs, stowing the dollar in his ass for safekeeping.

The three homos scrambled out of the room and towards the treedome.

ONE HOUR LATER

Spongebob, Patrick and Squidward approached the door of Sandy's tree house, not so much as an undergarment between them, and knocked politely on the door.

Sandy didn't respond, so Patrick broke down the door with his erect, barrel-like member.

"SANDY," they screamed, not caring about the lack of water. "SAAAAAANDY!"

Patrick picked up some mud and smeared it on his face. "I'M DIRTY DAN," he growled.

"I hope Dirty Dan likes getting RAMMED UP THE ASS," yelled Spongebob, as he thrust his supple yellow cattle prod into Patrick's chasmal pink rear. Patrick groaned in pleasure.

"Who you callin' pinhead?"

"SHUT THE FUCK UP! DIRTY DAN DOESN'T TALK," screamed Spongebob as he climaxed.

Patrick scooped out some of Spongebob's cum from his cavernous brown crevice and smeared it into Squidward's eyes. "YOU'RE DIRTY DAN!"

"UNGHHHH, IT HURTS SO GOOD!" Squidward smeared the semen into his eyes until they bled. Blood and semen gushed down his face.

"THIS REMINDS ME OF THAILAND," said Spongebob pensively, puffing on his pipe, which he fashioned out of one of his older penises.

Squidward enjoyed what remained of Spongebob's cum as Spongebob rode the tip of Patrick's voluminous horsehitch into Sandy's room. She was sleeping, but she looked like she had put on weight. Her futa cock was fully erect.

"LET'S RAPE HER," suggested Patrick, peeling Spongebob off his penis and throwing him violently against the wall. "Wait Patrick, don't you know ANYTHING about squirrels?" cautioned Spongebob, ripping off his damaged member and growing a new one. He placed the damaged one on a necklace he was keeping.

"I KNOW THEY'RE EXCELLENT TARGETS FOR RAPE, ESPECIALLY WHILE THEY'RE SLEEPING," said Patrick as he jammed his holiday yule log into Sandy's ear. She was fast asleep and didn't seem to notice, but her cock twitched.

"It's called HIBERNATION, Patrick. Squirrels stuff valuable treasures into their vaginas and then go to sleep for six months."

"TREASURE? I WANT TREASURE" roared Patrick as he dove head-first into Sandy's gaping pussy. "UHH, I'M STUCK. WHERE'S THE TREASURE?"

"GO...DEEPER!" grunted Spongebob, giving Patrick a good shove.

"I CAN'T. I'M TOO FAT," he replied. "I'M REALLY HORNY THOUGH."

Spongebob chuckled. His plan had worked. Patrick was incapacitated and he was free to suck off Sandy's futa cock while she slept.

"SPONGEBOB? SPONGEBOB, WHAT ARE YOU DOING OUT THERE?" Patrick's muffled voice rang out from somewhere nearby, but Spongebob was enjoying Sandy's hard, flexible prick in his mouth.

Sandy rolled over and her dick went through the side of Spongebob's mouth and out one of his ear holes. "COME ON, DAMMIT, WHY WON'T YOU CUM?" muttered Spongebob as he moved himself sensually up and down the length of Sandy's anaconda.

At last, the sleeping squirrel climaxed, shooting hot greasy cum from Spongebob's ear. He pocketed some of it because he knew Krabs would require proof, probably while raping him violently.

"MMMRH? WHO SUCKED ME OFF?" murred Sandy as she rubbed her eyes.

"SPONGEBOB, YOU CHEATER!" yelled Patrick, his voice muffled by the squirrel's vaginal wall.

Spongebob ran as fast as his gay little legs would carry him out of Sandy's room. Squidward was attempting to fuck a tree.

$------------------$















I’ve been worried about you. How are you getting along without a country? Last I heard you were stuck in that broken down bus known as the old U S of A. Didn’t that thing lose its steering after they ripped out the old Constitution? Now, shit, you tell me the brakes are shot and the passengers are what? Bat shit? Still talking about the Democratic Party as if it were, you know, a thing? Trying to shoe-horn yet another Clintonista into the driver’s seat. Hey, look on the bright side. It might only be mad cow. You can hope. Anyway, enough of Trump, Hilary, Republicans, Democrats and the whole God awful stew of yesterday’s news. Good-bye to the whole have-your-cake-and-bomb-them-too mentality. Bury the fuckers. It’s over. Good riddance.

The question is what are you going to do now, player? I mean that bus is headed down the mountain. All the f’ing passingers are screaming. “do something! Do something!” But there’s not one f’ing asshole on the whole God damned bus who can act. I know, scientists are revealing truths, politicians scheming and babbling incoherently, but hey, who is shitting whom? All that means jack. It’s out of f’ing control! It’s obvious. The land of the free and the home of the brave? No man, it’s an improvised explosive device tied to a runaway bus. Where is right and where wrong? Who the fuck’s got his finger on the nukes? Two to one his other finger is up his ass. What’s the dot gov doing man? The vehicle is smashing into people, wrecking countries. What for? Democracy? Excuse me? It is death in the largefamily size, plain and simple. And the family is your family, Buddy..

The whole world watches with horror while this out-of-control motherfucker careens down the mountain. This sad remains of a country is smashing everything up. I know, I know, it’s the deep state, pulling levers, wrenching the wheel, pumping pedals but it don’t mean shit. That’s because the deep-state is bonkers, stupid, vicious and never learned to drive an out-of-control motherfucker like this baby. That is, if the deep-state exists. I mean who the fuck knows? Anyway, the shit they pull, if they really pull shit, is not going to save their asses let alone yours.

So why is the deep-state still in control? What keeps the deep-state in control of this out-of-control mother fucker? Assuming they exist of course. Nothing about them is legitimate. The whole dot gov thing is a punch and judy show with a stick of dynamite up its ass. Secretly, behind the scenes the deep state is babbling out of f’ing control. They are hopeless on every count. Still they slip the bullshit to the bullshitters and everyone toddles along behind.

How does it work? How does the bullshit get to the bullshitter. Deep-state guys must tell non-deep-state guys to do things, or convey to them that they should do things in some circuitous underhand deep-state way, right? That is if there really are deep-state guys. I mean it’s non-deep-state guys who actually do the dirty work, correct? Deep-state guys don’t actually do shit. Deep-state guys get things done with hints and signs and shit and who knows what to signal their pleasure or displeasure to non-deep-state guys who toddle off in service to the deep state guys who may or may not exist. Non-deep-state guys learn to divine deep-state guys’ desires even without nods and winks and whatever. It’s all one big bollocks of bosses and lackeys and subtle hints and raised eyebrows and gobs of hypocrisy to cover over a cuckoo, vicious, moronic, and totally fucked up pile of deep-state shit. Of course now I’m talking about the highest level.

But deep-state guys, if they exist, are still just guys, right? I mean, they are just guys! Why are those non-deep-state guys kissing their butts? Given the obvious cluelessness of the deep-state guys hinting the planet into the crapper, isn’t your obedience a little, how should I put it, dumb? I know those deep-state guys are awesome, but come on. It’s just habit, isn’t it? I mean the USA, aside from being this out-of-control bomb, is now just a bad habit, isn’t it? Courts? Elections? Constitution? Forget about it. It’s just habit. There’s no rhyme or reason, even for the deep-state guys. And given that it’s taking us to the crapper, a bad habit. Forget about the founding fathers, this shit is really happening, dude.

I suppose you could get money and power so-called from sucking up, but is that enough to trade for species extinction? What good is toddling along behind the deep state guys on a planet cooked well-done? Why not, as Nancy Reagan put it, just say no? Okay, deep-state guys will be deep-state guys. I sure as hell am not going to talk them out of it, even though they are being stupid. They are going to deep-state themselves right into deep do do, assuming they exist. But you, kid, you! Are you ready to crash headfirst into eternity? Is this a new sexual orientation?

Now I’m sure you don’t need any more proof that everything is fucked up and on the way to the crapper. All roads lead to shit. That, I think, is one thing everyone can agree to. The bedrock of civilized conversation. So that’s why I skipped that part. Maybe it’s a hundred years, maybe two hundred. It’s hard to imagine more. Most likely much less, more like fifteen or two, but what do I know? After whatever, eternity. The difference is the difference of a blink of an eye. Anyway, what I want to ask is, is that okay with you?

Now before you get your knickers in a twist let me just say I am not trying to get you to do anything you don’t want to do. I’m not going to say, “it’s all going to shit unless…” Unless..? No, buddy. I don’t think there is an “unless”. Disabuse yourself of that “unless”. We’re headed for the crapper. Period, full stop.

Don’t believe me? Still of the what-me-worry persuasion? How about alternative fuels? If we are gobbling down energy of any kind we will burn hydrocarbons. If nobody is using them they will be cheap. Laws won’t stop deep-state people from finding a way to make a buck. And poverty makes laws disappear. In industrial civilization we always want more– vacations, houses, cars, entertainment. And industrial civilization needs to sell us more. Chug all the alternative fuels you want, we will still want more. We will fight for more and so need armies, navies and cyber-warriors. Militaries will use hydrocarbons and fuck you if you don’t like it. If it’s there we will use it. Industrial civilization always needs more. Only the end of industrial civilization will end hydrocarbon burning and that ain’t happening, buster. No, babe, the rock has begun to roll. It would take an absolute all-out mobilization of the entire species in a unified well-organized crash-course of action to eliminate industrial civilization without blowing up the world to give the planet even the ghost of a chance of a snowball in a steaming pile of shit. So that all-out effort will almost certainly fail. I hope that’s not too alarmist.

So no, I don’t expect you to do anything, Buddy. Put your mind to rest. The planet is barbecuing, shit is spreading, people are getting upset, and the deep-state is doubling down in order to pursue an astonishingly stupid mind-fuck of world-domination, — unless they don’t exist in which case nobody is steering the fucking bus. Put it all together and it spells bye-bye.

Hey, know what? Every deep-state guy, if he exists, is pursuing a sub-rosa scheme to feather a tropical-island bolt-hole nest a la Saddam. A comfy little hidey-hole for our bird-brained leaders. They plan to skip out and lay low in style when whatever hits the whatever. Maybe you can flap your way to one of those with them? Kiss the right ass and win a trip to cloud-cuckoo land. When the champagne runs out and they scamper aboard their jets maybe you can hitch a ride as drink steward or just stow away like a bed bug.

Of course that won’t last long. In the end you just dry up into a parasite’s remains, the fossil of an exoskeleton. Is that what you want, Buddy? To end up as a kind of parasitic remains? This, I admit, is what I am worried about. You, Buddy, you! Buddy, you’re not a tapeworm. You’re better than that. Wouldn’t it be better to make this all-out last-ditch effort even if it is, in all likelihood, futile? Wouldn’t that be a better, a nobler way to go than sucking blood til the earth runs dry! Killing people, destroying cities, fucking up every place you are not? So if you think it would be a good idea to make this effort, it might be worthwhile to ask just what this effort would entail. I mean for fucking real.

Well, that's just, like, your opinion, man.

They're rushing defense doesn't appear to be the most potent at first glance, but there is a lot this front 7 does to support the NFL's best passing defense and the third best scoring defense.

Linebackers are responsible for tight ends and running backs most of the time in pass coverage. Football Outsiders ranks Seattle 2nd against tight ends and 5th against running backs. Source

They've had nine fumble takeaways (7 fumbles were forced by front seven players), tied for 3rd. [Source](http://www.footballoutsiders.com/stats/teamdef)

In the red zone, when the field gets tighter and the front 7's athleticism becomes more effective, Seattle's defense ranks 4th (41.67% scoring percentage). [Source](http://espn.go.com/nfl/statistics/team/_/stat/givetake/sort/takeFumbles/position/defense/league/nfc)

Seattle's tied for the 5th most sacks (31, should have had more on Sunday). [Source](http://espn.go.com/nfl/statistics/team/_/stat/passing/sort/sacks/position/defense)

They've only allowed four rushing touchdowns, and the longest run they've given up is just 28 yards. [Source](http://espn.go.com/nfl/statistics/team/_/stat/rushing/sort/rushingTouchdowns/position/defense)

Football Outsiders ranks Seattle's pass rush as the 6th best in the NFL. [Source](http://www.footballoutsiders.com/stats/dl)

Last year, Bobby Wagner had the best run stop percentage ([Source](https://www.profootballfocus.com/about/pff-signature-stats/#RunStopPercentage) ), KJ Wright had the 4th best tackling efficiency ([Source](https://www.profootballfocus.com/about/pff-signature-stats/#TacklingEfficiency) ) and Bruce Irvin was the 6th most productive pass rusher ( [Source](https://www.profootballfocus.com/about/pff-signature-stats/#PassRushingProductivity) ). Those three have only gotten better this year.

There are eight players with multiple sacks. Chris Clemons has been this team's best pass rusher since 2010, but our two new additions (Michael Bennett with 6.5 and Cliff Avril with 5.5) have more sacks than him. Clinton McDonald has emerged as a quality pass rusher and has the same amount of sacks as Clemons (3.5). The team also has 26 tackles for a loss. [Source](http://espn.go.com/nfl/team/stats/_/name/sea/seattle-seahawks)

From a purely subjective standpoint, this front seven is also just damn scary.

[Exhibit A](http://s3.amazonaws.com/br-cdn/temp_images/2013/10/18/2013-10-1719_54_50.gif)

[Exhibit B](http://i.minus.com/iExO6YvM6b6d4.gif)

[Exhibit C](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-Mw0VB64Y5oE/Una-gtpMLhI/AAAAAAAADNk/4h5vq-_Z3W8/s400/GLENHI.gif)

[Exhibit D](http://cdn2.sbnation.com/imported_assets/1237707/idlGK3ptDOwsA.gif)

[Exhibit E](http://imageshack.com/a/img822/4760/uh5m.gif)

[Exhibit F](http://cdn2.sbnation.com/imported_assets/1847911/iQK5UrSrEQEb6.gif)

[Exhibit G](http://cdn0.sbnation.com/imported_assets/1875949/i6E7GF9LPSZRm.gif)

This unit is aggressive and it might be the most athletic group in the league. They consistently get to the quarterback, and when they're playing good run defense it is almost impossible to rush the ball. Yeah, they've had some bad games, but I wouldn't let that determine how good this front seven is.

Back the fuck off. Shes MY Swedish girlfriend you fucking dumbass. If you try to get at her, I will find where you live and beat the shit out of you. I'll tie your body to a chair and fucking curb stomp your balls until you pass out from the pain.I will drive you to the hospital and slice your throat open just to throw you into the doorway and make you beg mercilessly for help.

hi.
you're on a rock floating in space.
pretty cool, huh?
some of it's water.
fuck it, actually most of it's water.
i can't even get from here to there without buying a boat.
it's sad.
i'm sad.
i miss you.
how did this happen?
a long time ago, actually never, and also now, nothing is nowhere.
when?
never.
makes sense, right?
like i said, it didn't happen.
nothing was never anywhere.
that's why it's been everywhere.
it's been so everywhere you don't need a where.
you don't even need a when.
that's how every it gets.
forget this.
i wanna be something.
go somewhere.
do something.
i want things to change.
i want to invent time and space.
and i know it's possible because everything is here and it probably already happened.
i just don't know when to start.
and that's exactly where it started.
whoah, i paused it.
i think there's a universe now.
what's it made of?
quarks & stuff
ah, that's a thing.
in a place.
don't like it?
try a new place.
at a different time™.
try to stick together, because the world is gonna get bigger.
and emptier.
but it's not empty yet.
it's still very full, and about a kjghpillion degrees.
great news!
the quarks are now happily married, in groups of three called a proton or a neutron
and there's something else flying around too that wants to join in but can't cause it's still too
HOT

great news!
the protons and neutrons are now happily married to each other.
and some of them even doubled up.
great news, the electrons have now joined in
congratulations, the world is now a bunch of gas in space.
but it's getting closer together.
and it's getting closer together.
and it's getting closer toge-
it's a star
new shit just got made!
some stars burn out and die.
bigger stars burn out and die with passion, and make some brand new, way crazier shit.
space dust
which allows newer, more interesting stars to be made, and then die, and explode into
even crazier space dust
so now stars have cool stuff around them, like rocks, ice, and funny clouds, which can make some very interesting things.
like this ball of flaming rocks for example.
holy shit, we just got hit with another ball of flaming rocks.
and it kind of made a mess.
which is
now the moon
weather update:
it's raining rocks from outer space.
weather update:
those rocks might have had water inside them, and now there's hot steam in the sky.
weather update:
cooler temperatures today, and the floor is no longer lava.
weather update:
it's raining.
severe flooding alert:
the entire world is now an ocean.
volcano alert:
that's land!
there's life in the ocean
what?
something's alive in the ocean
oh cool, like a plant or an animal?
no, a microscopic speck.
it lives at the bottom of the ocean and eats chemical soup, which is being served hot and fresh, made from gnarly space ingredients left over from when it was raining rocks or whatever.
oh yeah, and it can do that.
it has secret instructions written inside itself telling it how to build another one of itself.
so that's pretty nifty, i would say.
tired of living at the bottom of the ocean?
now you can eat sunlight!
using a revolutionary technique, you can convert sunlight into food
taste the sun
side effect: now there's oxygen everywhere and the sky's blue.
then the earth might have been a snowball for a while, maybe even a couple of times.
it's a sponge.
it's a plant.
it's a worm, and some other types of weird strange water bugs and strange fish.
it's the Cambrian explosion
"wow, that's animals and stuff"
but we're still in the ocean, hey, can we go on land?
no
why?
the sun is a deadly lazer
oh okay.
not anymore, there's a blanket
now the animals can go on land.
come on, animals, let's go on land!
nope, can't walk yet.
and there's no food yet, so i don't care.
ok, will you learn to walk if there's plants up here?
maybe, said some bugs, and fish.
ok, so i can go on land, but i have to go back in the water to
have babies
learn to use an egg.
i was already doing that.
use a stronger egg.
put water in it.
have a baby, on land, in an egg.
water is in the egg.
baby, in the egg, in the water, in the egg.
works for me.
bye bye ocean
and now everything's huge.
including bugs.
wanna see a map of the land?
sure.
oh fuck, now everything's dead.
just kidding, here are the survivors.
keep your eye on this one because it's about to become the dinosaurs.
here's another map of the land.
yeah, it broke apart, don't worry about it, it does that all the time.
here comes a meteor.
and the dinosaurs are gone
it's mammal time, here come the mammals.
look at those breasts.
now they're gonna dominate the world and one of them just learned how to grab stuff.
and walk.
no, like, walk like that.
and grab stuff at the same time.
and bang rocks together to make pointed rocks.
"ouch"
and set things on fire.
"yeouch"
and make crazy sounds with their voice.
"gneurshk"
which can mean different things.
that's a human person
and now they're everywhere.
almost.
ice age
what, you can walk over here?
cool.
not anymore
well i guess we're stuck here now.
let's review.
there's people on the planet.
and they're chasing their food.
fuck it, time to plant some grass.
look at this.
i control the food now.
now everyone will want to be my friend and live near me.
let's all build houses except mine is bigger because i own the food.
this is great, i wonder if anyone else is doing this.
tired of using rocks for everything?
use metal.
it's underground.
better farming was just invented, in a sweet dank valley right in between these two rivers.
and the animals are helping.
guess what happens next
more food.
and more people who came to buy the food.
now you need people to help make the food and keep track of the sales.
and now you need houses for people to live in and people to make the houses, and now there's more people and they invent things, which makes things better and more people come and there's more farming and more people to make more things for more people and now there's business, money, writing, laws, power.
Society
coming soon to a dank river valley near you.
meanwhile, out in the middle of nowhere, the horse is probably being tamed.
why is all my metal so lame and lumpy?
tired of using lame, sad metal?
introducing
Bronze
made with special ingredient tin from the far lands of tin land.
i don't know, my dealer won't tell me where he gets it.
also, guess what?
egypt
meanwhile, out in the middle of nowhere, they figured out how to put wheels on a horse.
now we're getting somewhere.
also
china
and did i mention
indus river valley civilization
norte chico
the middle east is getting more complicated, maybe because it's in the middle of the east.
knock knock, er, clop clop.
it's the people with the horses.
and they made an empire.
and then everyone else copied their horses.
greeks
ah look, it must be the greeks, er, a beta version of the greeks.
let's check in with the indus river valley civilization.
they're gone.
guess who's not gone?
china
new arrivals in india, maybe it's those horse people i was talking about, or their cousins or something
and they wrote some hymns and mantras and stuff
you could make a religion out of this.
there's the bronze age collapse.
now the phoenicians can get down to business
also, can we switch to a metal that's a little easier to find?
thanks.
look who came back to israel, it's the twelve tribes of israel.
and they believe in God
just 1 though, he's got like a ten step program.
here's some huge heads.
must be the olmecs.
the phoenicians make some colonies.
the greeks copy their idea and make some colonies.
the phoenicians made a colony so big it makes colonies.
here comes the assyrian empire.
never mind, it's the babylonian- median-
it's the Persian Empire
"wow, that's big"
ah, the buddha was just enlightened.
who's the buddha?
this guy, who sat under a tree for so long that he figured out how to ignore the fact that we're all dying.
you could make a religion out of this.
oops, china just broke, but while it was breaking, confucius was figuring out how to have good morals.
ah, the greeks just had the idea of thinking about stuff.
and right over here, alexander just had the idea of conquering the entire persian empire.
it's a great idea.
he was great.
and now he's dead.
hopefully the rest of the gang will be able to share the empire evenly between them.
knock knock, it's chandragupta, he says get the hell out of here.
will you get the hell out of here if i give you 500 elephants?
ok thanks, bye
time to conquer all of india
or
most of india
but what about this part?
that's the tamil kings, no one conquers the tamil kings.
who are the tamil kings?
merchants, probably
and they've got spices
who would like to buy the spices?
me, said the arabians, swiftly buying it and selling it to the rest of the world.
hey, china put itself back together again, with good morals as their main philosophy.
actually, they have three main philosophies.
out here, the horse nomads run wild and free, and they would like to ransack your city.
let's check the greekification levels of the greekified kingdoms.
greekification overload!
bye, said the parthians.
bye, said the jews.
hi, said the parthians, taking over the entire place.
heyyyyyyyy, said the romans, eating the entire mediterranean for breakfast.
thanks for invading our homeland, said the jews, who were starting to get tired of people invading their homeland.
hi, everything's great, said some guy who seems to be getting very popular and is then arrested and killed for being too popular, which only makes him more popular.
you could make a religion out of this.
want silk?
now you can buy it from china.
they just made a
brand new road to the world
or you can
get there on water
sick! new trade routes! said india, accidentally spreading their religion to the entire southeast.
hmm, that's a good place for an epic trading kingdom.
there goes buddhism traveling up the silk road.
i wonder if it'll reach china before it collapses again.
remember the persian empire?
yep, said the persians, making a new one.
axum is getting so powerful they would like to build a long stick.
has anyone populated madagascar yet?
let's do it together.
china is whole again
then it broke again
still can't cross the sahara desert?
try camels.
hell yeah! now we've got business
said the ghana empire, selling lots of gold, and slaves
hi, i live in the roman empire, and i was wondering
is loving jesus legal yet?
no.
actually, ok, sure, said constantine, moving the capital way over here to be closer to his
main rival
don't worry about rome, it won't fall.
it's the golden age of india
there's the gupta empire, not chandragupta, just gupta.
first name chandra.
the first.
guess who's in rome?
barbarians
what's a barbarian?
non-romans, said the romans, being invaded by non-romans.
r.i.p., roman empire, er, actually just half of it, the other half is just fine, but it's not in rome anymore so let's give it a new name.
the mayans have figured out the stars
oh and here's a huge city, population: everyone
the göktürks have taken over the entire eurasian steppe.
great job, göktürks.
how's india?
broken.
how's china?
back together
how's those trading kingdoms?
bigger, and there's more of them
korea has 3 kingdoms.
japan has a kingdom, it's the sunrise kingdom.
deep in the arabian desert, on the top of a mountain, the real god whispers in muhammed's ear.
so he goes down to the cube where everyone worships gods and he tells them their gods are all fake.
and everyone got so mad at him that he had to leave town and go to a different town.
you could make a religion out of this.
and maybe conquer the world as well.
the roman empire is long gone, but somehow the pope is still the pope.
plus there's
new kingdoms all over europe
i wonder if there's room for moors.
here's all the wisdom.
in a house.
it's the baghdad house of wisdom.
just in time for the
islamic golden age
let's bring stuff to the coast and sell it, and become the swahili on the swahili coast, said the swahili on the swahili coast.
remember this tiny space you have to go through to get from here to there?
someone owns that now.
wanna get enlightened in the middle of nowhere?
the franks have the biggest kingdom in europe, and the pope is so proud that he invites the king over for christmas.
surprise! you're the new roman emperor, said the pope, pretending to still be part of the roman empire.
then the franks broke their kingdom into what will later be called france and not france.
but the northerners, or just norse if you don't have much time, are exploring.
they go north, from the north to the northern north.
and they find some land.
two types of land.
and they name them accordingly.
they also invade some other places, and get called many names, such as vikings.
there's the rus.
the kievan rus.
are they vikings?
i don't think so, said the kievan rus.
ok, fair enough.
the pope is ready to make some more emperors.
of the "roman empire".
the holy roman empire.
it's actually germany but don't worry about it.
new kingdoms.
christianize all the kingdoms
which brand would you like?
mine's better.
mine's better.
mine's better.
time to conquer england, said william.
it's a bird, it's a plane
it's the seljuk turks
aah! said the byzantine empire who's getting so small and almost doesn't exist anymore.
we need help!
they need help, so they call the pope.
hey pope, can you help us get rid of the seljuks?
maybe take back the holy land on the way?
come on, i know you want to take back the holy land.
yes, i do actually want to do that.
let's do a crusade.
crusade
they did many crusades, some of which almost didn't fail.
but at least the italians got some sweet trade deals.
goodbye mayans.
hello toltecs
goodbye toltecs.
hello mississippi
look at those mounds.
there's the pueblo.
i always wondered how to build a town in a cliff.
guess who's here?
khmer.
where?
here.
and pagan is there.
vietnam unconquered itself, korea just became itself, and japan is so addicted to art that the military might have to take over the government.
china just invented bombs, and typing.
and the mongols just invaded most of the universe.
nice going, Genghis!
i bet that will last a long time.
some of the islamic turks were unaffected by the mongol invasions because they were busy invading india.
is it tonga time?
i think it's tonga time.
i just found out where the swahili gets all their gold.
look at this chad.
means "lake".
there's an empire there.
right in the middle of
Africa
the king of mali is so rich he's going on tour to let everyone know.
wow, that guy's rich, everyone said.
the christians are doing a great job reconquering iberia, which will soon be called spain and not spain.
please remain christian.
we will check in later to see if you're still christian when you least expect.
whoops, half of europe just died.
ming
china's back, yay!
hey khmer, time to share.
new kingdoms here and there.
oh, look who controls all the islands.
it's the mahajapit.
majahapit.
mapajahit.
mahapajit.
mapajahit.
majapahit?
oh, italy's really rich, time for them to care a lot about art and the ancient classics.
it's kinda like a rebirth.
here's a printer.
let's make books.
so you think you can conquer the byzantine empire?
yep, said the ottoman turks.
nice job, ottoman turks.
whoops, you missed a spot.
don't forget to ban europe from the indian spice trade.
what? that's bullshit, said portugal, spiceless.
well i guess we'll have to find another way to india
wait! said christopher columbus, probably smoking crack.
if the world is round, let's go this way to india.
nah, don't worry, we already got this, said portugal.
so chris goes to spain.
hey spain, wanna hire me to find india by going around back of the world?
no.
please?
no.
please?
no.
please?
ok.
so he sails into the ocean.
and discovers more ocean.
and then discovers the indies.
and japan.
let's draw a line to decide who gets which half of the world.
the aztec and inca empires are off to a great start.
i wonder if they know that europe just discovered their continent?
the habsburgs are marrying into so many royal families they might have to start marrying each other.
move over lithuania, here comes moscow.
ivan wants to make russia great again.
move over timurids, maybe go invade india or something.
persia just made persia persian again.
let's make it the other kind of islam.
the one where we thought the first guy should have been the other guy.
hey christians!
do you sin?
now you can buy your way out of hell.
that's bullshit.
this whole thing is bullshit.
that's a scam.
fuck the church.
here's 95 reasons why, said martin luther, in his new book, which might have accidentally started the protestant reformation.
you know what would be magnificent, said suleiman, wearing an onion hat?
what if the ottoman empire was really big?
which it is now.
what if russia was big? said ivan, trying not to be terrible.
portugal had a dream that they controlled the entire indian ocean, including the spice trade.
and then that dream was real.
and spain realized that this is not india, but they pillaged it anyway.
damn, said england and france.
we gotta start pillaging some stuff.
then the dutch revolt and all the hipsters move to amsterdam.
damn, said amsterdam.
we gotta start pillaging some stuff.
question 1: can you get to india through north america?
no, but at least there's beaver.
question 2: steal the spice trade.
that's not a question, but the dutch did it anyway.
sugar
guess where all the sugar's made?
in brazil.
stolen
and the caribbean.
and it's so god damn profitable you might forget to not do slavery.
the next thing on russia's to-do list is to get bigger.
britain and france are having a friendly discussion about who should control the entire world.
more specifically, ohio.
then it escalates into a seven year discussion, giving prussia a chance to show austria who's boss.
but what about britain and france, did they figure out who's boss?
yes they did.
it's britain.
guess who's broke?
also britain.
so they start taxing the hell out of america.
fuck you, says america, declaring their independence, and fighting for it.
and france helps them win, now france is broke.
and britain'll have to send their prisoners to a different continent.
wait, if france is broke, why do the king and queen still wear such fancy dresses?
let's overthrow the palace and cut all their heads off! said robespierre, cutting everybody's head off until someone eventually got mad and cut his head off.
you could make a reli- no, don't.
haiti is staring to like the idea of a revolution.
especially the slaves, who free themselves by killing their masters.
why didn't we think of this before?
wait, who's in charge of france now?
me
said napoleon, trying to take over europe.
luckily, they banished him to an island.
but he came back
luckily, they banished him to another island.
there goes latin america, becoming independent in the latin american wars of independence.
britain just figured out how to turn steam into power.
so now they can make
many different types of machines and factories with machines in them so they can make a lot of products real fast
then they invent some trains.
and conquer india and maybe put some trains there.
hey, china! said britain.
buy stuff from us!
nah dude, we already got everything, says china.
so britain tried to get them addicted to opium.
which worked, actually.
but then china made it illegal and dumped it all into the sea.
so britain threw a hissy fit, and made them open up five cities and give them an island.
britain and russia are playing a game where they try to stop each other from conquering afghanistan.
also, the
sultan of oman lives in zanzibar now
"that's just where he lives"
india just had a revolution, and they would like to govern themselves now.
nope, said britain, governing them even harder than before.
technology is about to go crazy
the united states finally figured out whether slavery is good or bad.
it's bad, they decided.
and then they continued manifesting their destiny, which is to kill the rest of the natives and take their land and maybe kick out the mexicans too.
i know, let's rape africa, said europe, scrambling to see who could rape it the fastest.
they never got ethiopia
britain and france are still hungry.
they never got thailand
the united states ran out of destiny to manifest, so they're looking for more.
hawaii
cuba
wait, spain controls cuba.
well, blame something on them and go to war!
what should we blame on spain?
let's blame the maine on spain.
so they blame the maine on spain.
now we're in business.
to celebrate, they kick panama out of panama and make a canal, connecting the two oceans.
britain just found oil in the middle east.
it makes cars go
china is so tired of being bossed around that they delete their old government and make a new, stronger government, which is accidentally weaker and controlled by a guy from the previous government.
europe hasn't had a war since the last war.
so they start world war 1.
look at those guns.
it's gonna be a great war.
so great we won't need a second one.
after it's over, they blame germany.
russia went on strike and the workers overthrew the government.
now everyone's paycheck is the same.
communism
in the soviet union
the arabs revolt and britain helps.
now the ottoman empire's gone so we can give the
jewish people a place to live
hopefully the arabs won't mind.
let's cut the cake, said sykes and picot, carving up the remains of the not-so-ottoman-anymore empire.
except turkey, turkey makes a brand new turkey
and then the saudis conquer arabia.
it just seemed like the right thing to do.
hello?
yes, it's the 1920's calling.
let's get in the car and drive to a party and listen to jazz on the radio and go to the movies.
the economy's great and it'll probably be great forever, just kidding.
germany's back, featuring hitler, the angry mustache model.
and he's mad at the jews for existing.
japan is finally conquering the east, and they're so excited they rape nanking way too hard.
they should probably just deny it.
hitler's out of control.
so the international community tackles him and then tries to explain why killing all the jews is a bad idea.
but he kills himself before they could explain it to him.
that's world war 2
bonus round!
pacific showdown.
united states vs. japan.
fight!
finish him
let's unite all the nations and have some
world peace
seems legit.
hi, i'm gandhi, and if britain doesn't get the hell out of india, i'm gonna starve myself in public.
wow, that worked?
bonus, now there's pakistan.
actually two pakistans.
one of them can be bangladesh later.
the jews and the arabs finally figured out which one of them should live in the holy land.
me, they both said at the same time.
let's divide up the land so everyone's happy.
sike, they both get angrier
look out china, there's a new china in china.
what's on the menu?
communism!
no thanks, said the other china, escaping to an island.
i wonder which one is the real china?
there's the korean war, korea versus korea.
nobody wins, then it's on pause forever.
let's meet the sponsors.
oh, it's the two global superpowers.
they're having a friendly debate over which economic system is good, and which one is an evil virus of Satan.
and they both have atom bombs.
fight!
wait, no, that would be the end of the world.
let's just keep it cool and spy on each other instead.
and make sure we have enough atom bombs.
i'll race you to space.
now let's make some more countries fight themselves.
europe is tired of pillaging other continents, so the continents they were pillaging are tired of being pillaged.
so here's a new map, with new countries.
now you can't tell who they're being pillaged by.
the united states finally decided whether racism is good or bad.
they decided it's bad, and the world agrees.
south africa might need another minute to think about it.
let's check the world population.
whoa.
okay.
technology's better too, that might keep happening.
the soviet union decides to relax a little, and accidentally falls apart.
europe makes a union, so now they can all use the same money, except britain, because they don't feel like it.
let's check the mail.
surprise, it's on the computer.
whoops, someone just attacked america.
i bet they'll remember that.
phone call.
surprise, it's in your pocket.
wanna learn everything?
surprise, it's on the computer.
now your phone's a computer, which is in your pocket.
whoops, the economy just crashed.
don't worry, the big banks won't fail because they're not supposed to.
surprise!
flying robots.
with bombs.
wanna print a brain?
some people have no friends.
some people have no food.
the globe is warming
and the ocean is full of plastic
let's save the planet! said everybody, not knowing how.
let's invent a thing inventor, said the thing inventor inventor, after being invented by a thing inventor.
that's pretty cool.
by the way, where the hell are we?
FIN

It's so fun! I started a club and put fliers all over town. I did this so I could show this show to people and educate all of these simpletons who clearly could not wrap there minds around R&M humor.
I had over 20 people show up to our first meeting. Everyone seemed excited. We continued to watch season 1 and you could just tell that everyone couldn't understand the humor.
There was a girl who attended and she complimented my fedora and I opened the door for her and tipped my fedora making sure to refer to her as M'Lady.
I could tell she was floored by my gentleman like characteristics. She told me she loved my neckbeard and fedora and wanted to come and check out my magic cards.
She accompanied me home where we ate doritos and mountain dew together. I asked her if she liked IQ tests and she said hers was extremely high which immediately caused my willie to grow twice it's original size. She told me my lack of deodorant and cologne really turned her on.
She scooted my Settlers Of Catan box out of the way and began making out with me. I was in quite the corfuffle. After we made out I looked her in the eye and said, You just wanted me for my high IQ. She began sobbing and told me not to leave and thats when I put on my minecraft hoodie and as I lowered my 8 bit sunglasses said "We are Wubba Lubba Dub Done" and I walked out of my room and went outside where a parade was happening just for me. Word of my high IQ spread throughout my town and thousands of topless women stood at the ready. I gave a speech and the crowd hung off my every word. I became mayor and I am mayor of that town still till this very day. Questions welcomed.

Well if you like the show you clearly have a very high IQ, like myself. So do not feel bad!

 I know sometimes, people like ourselves, who have astrinomical IQ's can feel down and sad because nobody gets us. 

 I once went up to a "friend" (or I thought he was my friend, we were as close as two brothers) and yelled I'M PICKLE RICK!!!!  

Do you know what his response was???  

"I don't watch Rick & Morty....it sucks"

I then proceded to take out a pickle I keep in my fridge (labeled pickle rick) and beat him over the head with it while shoving szcheuan sauce into his eyeholes until he was dead. 

I then ate him to hide the evidence.
  Not like it matters. Not like anything anyone ever does matters. 
I'M PICKLE RICK!!















$------------------$















You act as if you do anything of meaning which is laughable. You're pathetic. A sad excuse for a human and acting like you're anything more than what you're describing is hilarious. You're so full of yourself yet you do nothing of importance. I'm not lying. I'm not the one acting all mighty like you are so honestly I'm done with this conversation. You're an idiot and also will never amount to anything but keep acting like you will.
Art is worth how much you're willing to pay, therefore his art is worth nothing to me :smiley: enjoy acting like you know more than everyone because you sit here and suck off a shitty artist because society says he's famous and good.
Don't bother replying cause I'm blocking you have a shitty day :smiley:

As my hands clenched tighter around the assistance handles in the disabled toilets I found myself in I could feel and hear the walls cracking. The strenuous unclenching and forceful pushing made no distraction to the burning of a thousand supernova I felt around the delicate ring to my dark chasm.

As the bricks of the toilet block began to shatter around myself like glass ware falling from the table I managed to send myself deaf with the amount of herculean yelling I was bellowing from my lungs. Slowly I could feel the rosebud in between my rosy cheeks begin to part like that of the red sea in the story of Moses.

Solid and slow I could feel the end result of a week of accumulation of black mass scraping its way down my long tube of meat innards. Its relative size being that of a baseball forced my red ring to stretch to a size thought impossible to my naive virgin faecal cave.

Suddenly and without warning I felt a rush of liquid greater than that of Niagara falls rush faster than the Mississippi down the waste pipes of my insides towards the concrete nugget. A sound even louder than my strongman yawp began to rumble around my soft mid section.

The pressurisation within me could last no longer. My brown eye having been fully stretched to ludicrous limits finally gave way with a tear. The black mass propelled by an apocalyptically large amount of brown liquid that followed crashed into the porcelain throne I was perched upon.

Having been made in the most remote factories of mainland China this Ming Flushy boi could not withstand the force of a weeks worth compacted gut rot. Having anticipated this worst case scenario I managed to move myself into a squat and hang on for dear life as the white seat of relief shattered around me.

Having expelled enough liquid to fill an Olympic sized swimming pool along with a sphere of bowel product large enough to choke a Clydesdale I resorted to attempting the impossible of cleaning a shit that can't wipe. I grabbed what sheets I could from this back end of town Lavatory building could offer.

Still hovering of the razor sharp shards below I began to wipe the deflated mud patch that resided between my now whip lashed posterior. To my surprise I found not a horrific sight of both expulsion and my own flesh but a completely dry chocolate star fish.

A little bit of backstory.

I started playing CS:GO around two or three years ago. When I first started out I already saw and knew firsthand that the game was going to be challenging. I knew that it was going to be difficult, but I am now at a loss.

As time went on, just as we all did, I began to learn about jailbreak, simon says, hopscotch and other things.

I began to learn the concept of being a warden, and using keybinds to look different directiosn

I've used almost every surf training map that they have out there which people have told me to use.

I've practiced my bhopping every day for weeks at a time.

I've done just about everything in the book that people have told me to try and get better. I've taken month long breaks, I've taken breathers, sit outs and all other manner of just underline resting periods.

I feel as though nothing has helped.

As much as I hate to admit it, it has also started to impact my personal life.

Friends, family and others tell me I don't act like how I used to. They say my personality has been changed and I notice it too.

I've sat awake at night thinking to myself, "Why do I keep trying to get better at something I know I'm no good at?"

But then I hear people tell me that I'm not necessarily bad but then I'm not necessarily good either.

All in all it has made me pretty emotionally upset and overall depressed me more often than not.

I can't quit. Not now. I feel like I've invested far too much time into the game to stop now. I don't know what goal I'm trying to reach, what possible end game I'm looking for that will finally sate this hunger to get better.

You sit there and wish that there was a magic word or something that could just make you better. But there is no such word.

I find myself sitting at Ralph's General Store day in and day out, thinking, plotting doing anything I can to try and think of how to get better.

I've tried calming myself down, steadily breathing, not getting uppity or angry yet I find it still doesn't work.

If I could put into words the level of discouragement I feel that has resulted from CS:GO, I would try. But I can't.

I guess the underline point is, is I'm ready to give up. I feel like everyone around me is better than me at everything. Surf shortcuts, silky pearl surfing, simon says, and whatever else.

It even feels like it has carried over into other games such as Fortnite and even offline games like Lego Dinos.

So if anyone has any suggestions or any advice to give I'd appreciate it.

Thanks.

-Dlec.

Edit: Thanks so much for the reply's so far. This has all given me some hope.

I was arrested at 18 with 3 of my girlfriends for pot. I was terrified, it's the only time I've ever been arrested. My car was towed, we got frisked, cuffed, and put into a van. We got to the station they took our mugshots, prints, medical info, and lead us to a room that was like a mix of an office & gym. A policewoman in her late 20's early 30's came in, put 4 boxes in front of us and with a smile, said "Strip, bra & panties too!" The looker room at our old school had private stalls, my doctor was the only person who'd ever seen me naked and I thought that was humiliating. We got undressed as slowly as possible, my hands trembled as I took my bra off. We stood there nude, trying to cover up to preserve what little dignity we still had. "Hands behind your head!" smiling as she said it, I don't know if it was sexual or a power thing but she loved her job. "Wow, you'er going to be popular girls in here tonight. Now stand on the red line, facing the chair." She put on gloves making sure to loudly snap them, then ripped off a piece of that paper they use on doctor's tables and put it on the chair. If you want a visual of what what happened, look up "ACLU prison strip search is abusive" they show a training video, censoring the girl's face and nothing else. She told us 1 by 1 to do that, plus said to do jumping jacks and "Lift your tits by the nipple." even my friend with A cups had to do it. She'd make rude comments about our bodies and look at our faces. If she saw we looked away she'd yell "Eyes forward!" she made sure we saw every inch of each other's skin. "I still think you girls are hiding something." and 1 by 1 we had to do it again. We showered next, she'd say things like "Scrub those pussies, girls like fish to be fresh." We got on uniforms and she walked us to our cell, during the walk said we'd have 3 lesbian cellmates. I was trying not to cry, she put us all in a 4 person cell, laughed "told ya!" Years later, I'm not gay or bi but I do have a WIP fetish.

when I was young and I discovered nutting since it just dripped out I peed it into a bottle then I was bragging to my buddies how I was cumming and they're like "dude what is that" so I brought the piss bottle with flakes of nut to school in my bag and my crush saw it

Hahaha my horse broke my toes

*How?*

She stepped on them and twisted and wouldn’t get off my toes and I had no shoes on

*Oh dang*

She Weighs over 15,000 pounds

*1500?*

Nope add another 0 too that

*There’s no was she can be that much.. maybe 1500?? But not 15,000*

She almost as big as a damn draft horse and her hoofs are bigger than my head

And we got papers on her telling us her weight

*The record for weight is 3336 in England*

Okay well this horse isn’t from here Abby you can’t be calling me a lair when I have damn papers in this bitch. You haven’t had horses your whole life and you sure don’t know everything about a horse honey so kinda get over yourself

You might be reading this shit on the internet but everything you read on the internet isn’t true. I have papers on this horse and your calling me a lair thatz real funny don’t you think. You haven’t even seen this horse this horse is bigger and huger then any horse ive own and she 10x the size of your

*You could get him/her in the record book. It would be famous.*

See thatz funny I hate bitches like you who know it all when you don’t and yes horses can weight over 15,000 pounds because I’ve seen some and I own one so don’t sit here and tell me I’m lying when I’m not. And my facts are straight. And this horse came from a prison and they had papers on her and it tell us everything about her so before you go and tell someone they lying make sure you have your facts straight. Bc you Mrs. Know it all isn’t always right and I didn’t ask for you in put I was talking to Abby

I’m done with the consideration I got animals to feed

Halloween is the devil's favorite holiday because everyone who participates in halloween is actually worshipping the devil. Its a straight gateway to hell. Carving pumpkins and lighting them is an invitation to invite the devil into your house, your lives and giving him control over your whole life, family, finances and destiny. When you wear a costume, no matter how innocent it looks, you're still changing your identity in Christ. You're partaking in evil. Did you even know the real origin in halloween? Halloween was invented by witches and warlocks who killed little children and used their blood as a sacrifice and on October 31st, they'd summon the devil and all the evil spirits and would let the devil have the child's soul. Theres evil in Halloween and whoever participates in it, chooses to follow the devil and worship him because thats exactly what people are doing when they celebrate Halloween. Anything that is dark and evil is from satan. Anything that is good and loving is from God. Even horror movies are from the devil. I stay away from all evil. I only follow Jesus. Hes the true light in this world, and without Jesus as your personal Lord and Savior, you won't make it to heaven. Theres no such thing as a "good" person. We're all sinners in need of a Savior. Jesus sacrificed his life for you and shed his blood for your sins. You have to ask God to forgive you for your sins, repent and accept Jesus as your Lord and Savior and have a personal relationship with him. You have to be born-again and saved, or else you wont make it to heaven. We're all already condemned to hell from adam and eve when they sinned. So we're automatically going to hell just for what adam and eve did because they brought sin into the world and every single person has sinned. God is holy, he wont let evil enter into his kingdom in heaven. But thank God for his beautiful love and mercy, he sent Jesus into the world to be the Savior for everyone's sins. Therefore, by accepting Jesus as your personal Lord and Savior, you are no longer condemned to hell like we all originally are. His blood cleanses you from all your sins and on judgement day, you'll stand before God with no guilt, no shame, you'll be a saint like Jesus and wont be condemned to hell. 😊 Today is the day to accept Jesus as your Savior. Give your life to him and tell him to come into your heart. Hell is real and so is heaven. The devil wants you and so does Jesus. But it's all your choice who you choose to follow and its your choice where you'll spend eternity where the soul NEVER dies. Heaven or Hell. Its your choice. Jesus is the ONLY way to heaven. Theres no other way.﻿

I’d watch your life bro. I wonder if they’d be ok with my life. On one occasion my son was in diapers and I noticed he took a shit. I picked him up and the sly bastard unlatched his diaper. Turd fell out and it made the most perfect impact plop on the ground. We just stared at the turd together.

I was wearing some regular underwear today because all my boxers were dirty, also some loose thin pants because it was pretty warm out. Anyway im in class when the teacher asks me to come up to the board to read a part of the book, im a bit nervous because i dont like pubic speaking but whatever and i start reading it. I notice i have to read 2 fucking pages of this shit, i start fucking up some words and i get a mini anxiety attack followed by an ever growing boner which looks bigger because underwear bunches up ur balls and cock.

I think whatever bitches will just think my cock is huge so great success, the thing is i start looking at some of the hotter girls in class in their yoga pants with their legs crossed over, my boner gets bigger and its starting to become noticable. i hear some people in the class say something and smiling, at this point im nervous as fuck and i can feel my face becoming red, i fumble with the words because all this compression in my underwear starts to feel good, at the same time its uncomfortable as fuck. I read some more and out of nowhere i say to the teacher "i cant do this anymore can i sit down?" she says no and tells me to finish, my knees start to weaken as i feel an orgasm starting to develop, i yell to the teacher "i have to go now!" the class starts laughing and a girl says "to put ur boner away" now the whole class is in tears laughing and tears of pain start to roll down my eyes but yet my penis is about to explode semen. I run to the door and try to open the doorknob but for some reason it doesnt open, i hear comments like "hes gone fuckin insane", i dont know what comes over me but i accept my new role as crazy.

I rip open my pants and yell "this is so fucking uncomfortable!" and whip my cock out, everybody gasps and yells omg, i start pulling on it and within seconds i start to explode, the teacher runs over and tries to stop me but i just end up jizzing on her, then on a couple people in the front row. everybody is screaming and security comes in and points a gun at me and tell me to get on the ground, i make a large cum stain on the floor where i am dragged away.

Leftists describe The_Donald as "the most evil narcissist for hundreds and hundreds of years". They elaborate that he is a "raging psychopath, devoid of the normal human responses to other people's suffering", and whose only ambition in life is to become all-powerful and immortal. He is also a sadist who hurts and murders people—especially Mexicans—just for pleasure. He has no conscience, feels no remorse, and does not recognize the worth and humanity of anybody except himself. He feels no need for human companionship or friendship, and cannot comprehend love or affection for another. He believes he is superior to everyone around him, to the point that he frequently refers to himself in the third-person as "The_Donald". Leftists also state that The_Donald is "incredibly power hungry. Racist, really", and that if The_Donald were to look into the Mirror of AknavI, he would see "Himself, all-powerful and eternal. That's what he wants."

I simply can't ignore it at this point but you trolls leave me no choice. You must've all seen the allegation post and brought up several accusations that i wouldn't have ever dreamed of. Which is why I'd like to make a post addressing it even further. I thought I would never have to go back to it but it seems nothing i say will be able to change your mind about me

One the most common things I've seen in the comments are people accusing me of having intercourse with a dog. Why? No other reason aside from me being a furry. It is a vile exaggeration of furries and it can't be further from the truth. 
The allegation came from a coworker who had it out for me constantly and wanted me to suffer. It had almost little to nothing to do with me being a furry. I do not take my personal interests to workplaces so its baseless to assume I went to jail because I am a furry.

Next question i get is that if this page is satire. I've gotten this question a lot from commenters and from page messages. This page is not satire, not a parody. Just a furry admining a gaming page and nothing else. Our posts used to be me posting about my trainwreck of a life and later on mainly submissions. It seems that starting with submissions the page really went viral and attracted a lot of trolls 

In conclusion, I'd like to say that i welcome anybody to this page. If you are a furry or a gamer this is the place for you. Even if you are a troll, i hope that this page gives you a favourable opinion for furries. And if not, you don't need to like the page.

Edit: another contribution to this is to the fact that i used the word "found" innocent instead of using "proven" innocent which are have very different meanings. English is not my first language so I wasn't able to really explain myself. I was PROVEN innocent because of lack of evidence and an alibi. Anybody who has played the Ace attorney game would understand.

"Let's open up your pic-a-nic basket today," Yogi Bear purred as Ranger Smith bent down and braced himself. "Yogi...no!" He screamed as he felt paws open a different hole than usual. The strong bear put an entire rib up his urethra. "OH SWEET CTHULU WHY!?!?" the ranger screamed in unbearable pain. The bone was pulled out aggressively, but some spicy sauce remained. "Now, since I'm smarter than an av-er-age bear, I know how to close the basket," Ranger Smith heard as he began to recover. A strong grip surrounded his penis and the unlucky young man screamed louder than before, as a thick fluid that looked like watery pink frosting spurted from the hole.

LOL, or lol, is an acronym for laugh(ing) out loud[1][2][3] or lots of laughs,[4][5][6] and a popular element of Internet slang. It was first used almost exclusively on Usenet, but has since become widespread in other forms of computer-mediated communication and even face-to-face communication. It is one of many initialisms for expressing bodily reactions, in particular laughter, as text, including initialisms for more emphatic expressions of laughter such as LMAO[7] ("laugh(ing) my ass off") and ROFL[8][9][10] (or its older form ROTFL;[11][12] "roll(ing) on the floor laughing"). Other unrelated expansions include the now mostly obsolete "lots of luck" or "lots of love" used in letter-writing.[13]

The list of acronyms "grows by the month",[9] and they are collected along with emoticons and smileys into folk dictionaries that are circulated informally amongst users of Usenet, IRC, and other forms of (textual) computer-mediated communication.[14] These initialisms are controversial, and several authors[15][16][17][18] recommend against their use, either in general or in specific contexts such as business communications.

LOL was first documented in the Oxford English Dictionary in March 2011.[19]

Analysis

Laccetti (professor of humanities at Stevens Institute of Technology) and Molski, in their essay entitled The Lost Art of Writing, are critical of the terms, predicting reduced chances of employment for students who use such slang, stating that, "Unfortunately for these students, their bosses will not be 'lol' when they read a report that lacks proper punctuation and grammar, has numerous misspellings, various made-up words, and silly acronyms."[15][16] Fondiller and Nerone in their style manual assert that "professional or business communication should never be careless or poorly constructed" whether one is writing an electronic mail message or an article for publication, and warn against the use of smileys and abbreviations, stating that they are "no more than e-mail slang and have no place in business communication".[17]

Yunker and Barry in a study of online courses and how they can be improved through podcasting have found that these slang terms, and emoticons as well, are "often misunderstood" by students and are "difficult to decipher" unless their meanings are explained in advance. They single out the example of "ROFL" as not obviously being the abbreviation of "rolling on the floor laughing" (emphasis added).[18] Haig singles out LOL as one of the three most popular initialisms in Internet slang, alongside BFN[dubious ] ("bye for now") and IMHO ("in my honest/humble opinion"). He describes the various initialisms of Internet slang as convenient, but warns that "as ever more obscure acronyms emerge they can also be rather confusing".[1] Bidgoli likewise states that these initialisms "save keystrokes for the sender but [...] might make comprehension of the message more difficult for the receiver" and that "[s]lang may hold different meanings and lead to misunderstandings especially in international settings"; he advises that they be used "only when you are sure that the other person knows the meaning".[20]

Shortis observes that ROFL is a means of "annotating text with stage directions".[10] Hershock, in discussing these terms in the context of performative utterances, points out the difference between telling someone that one is laughing out loud and actually laughing out loud: "The latter response is a straightforward action. The former is a self-reflexive representation of an action: I not only do something but also show you that I am doing it. Or indeed, I may not actually laugh out loud but may use the locution 'LOL' to communicate my appreciation of your attempt at humor."[9]

David Crystal notes that use of LOL is not necessarily genuine, just as the use of smiley faces or grins is not necessarily genuine, posing the rhetorical question "How many people are actually 'laughing out loud' when they send LOL?".[21] Franzini concurs, stating that there is as yet no research that has determined the percentage of people who are actually laughing out loud when they write LOL.[2]

Victoria Clarke, in her analysis of telnet talkers, states that capitalization is important when people write LOL, and that "a user who types LOL may well be laughing louder than one who types lol", and opines that "these standard expressions of laughter are losing force through overuse".[22] Egan describes LOL, ROFL, and other initialisms as helpful so long as they are not overused. He recommends against their use in business correspondence because the recipient may not be aware of their meanings, and because in general neither they nor emoticons are (in his view) appropriate in such correspondence.[3] June Hines Moore shares that view.[23] So, too, does Lindsell-Roberts, who gives the same advice of not using them in business correspondence, "or you won't be LOL".[24]

Acceptance

On March 24, 2011, LOL, along with other acronyms, was formally recognized in an update of the Oxford English Dictionary.[19][25] In their research, it was determined that the earliest recorded use of LOL as an initialism was for "little old lady" in the 1960s.[26] They also discovered that the oldest written record of the use of LOL in the contemporary meaning of "Laughing Out Loud" was from a message typed by Wayne Pearson in the 1980s, from the archives of Usenet.[27]

Gabriella Coleman references "lulz" extensively in her anthropological studies of Anonymous.[28][29]

A 2003 study of college students by Naomi Baron found that the use of these initialisms in computer-mediated communication (CMC), specifically in instant messaging, was actually lower than she had expected. The students "used few abbreviations, acronyms, and emoticons". Out of 2,185 transmissions, there were 90 initialisms in total;[30] 76 were occurrences of LOL.[31]

LOL, ROFL, and other initialisms have crossed from computer-mediated communication to face-to-face communication. David Crystal—likening the introduction of LOL, ROFL, and others into spoken language in magnitude to the revolution of Johannes Gutenberg's invention of movable type in the 15th century—states that this is "a brand new variety of language evolving", invented by young people within five years, that "extend[s] the range of the language, the expressiveness [and] the richness of the language".[32][30] However Geoffrey K. Pullum argues that even if interjections such as LOL and ROFL were to become very common in spoken English, their "total effect on language" would be "utterly trivial".[33]

Lexical form
The past tense of lol is lolled. The participle form is lolling.

Variants
lul: phonetic spelling of LOL. "LUL" is also commonly used in the gaming community, due to it being an emote from BetterTTV, an extension of Twitch.tv.
lolz: Occasionally used in place of LOL.
lulz: Often used to denote laughter at someone who is the victim of a prank, or a reason for performing an action. Its use originated with Internet trolls. According to a New York Times article about Internet trolling, "lulz means the joy of disrupting another's emotional equilibrium."[34] Can be used as a noun – e.g. "do it for the lulz.", shortened into "ftlulz" (to distinguish it from "ftl" – "for the loss"). See also LulzSec.
LOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOL: For added emphasis, LOL can be appended with any number of additional iterations of "OL". In cases such as these, the abbreviation is not to be read literally (i.e., "Laughing out loud out loud out loud out loud"), but is meant to suggest several LOLs in a row.
trolololol or trollololol: A portmanteau of troll and LOL iterated. Indicates that the prank or joke was made by internet trolls, or the user thinks the prank or joke qualifies as internet trolling. See also Mr. Trololo.
Derivations
lolwut (sometimes "lulwut"): lol + wut, used to indicate bemused laughter, or confusion.
lawl, lawlz, or lal: Pseudo-pronunciation of LOL. Saying "lawl" is sometimes meant in mockery of those who use the term LOL, and is not meant to express laughter.
lel: A satirical form of lol, often used to denote bemusement or lack of amusement in response to a statement.

You don't get to call me your best friend. You lost my trust and you lied to me I need you to understand that. What I did at school was my last act of kindness to you. You don't get to manipulate me by hurting yourself simply because you're "in love" with me. That was insulting to me. Carl is the one thing I'm sure about in my life. Holding on to knowing I'm going to have a husband and kids one day is what is keeping me going. For a while having a best friend I could count on made me happy too. But you hurt me and I will never forgive you for that. But you need to forgive yourself and get better because that's the best you can do in this situation. You said you respected Carl but I know you don't and I know what game you think you're playing. He's your friend still but don't mistake me for the same. I could have gone in there for my original intent saying how disturbed I was and how I saw it as harassment and manipulation but I didn't. You were my best friend but you hurt me and I never expected that so I let it slip. But I can't let you back into my life. I can't let you hurt me or anyone I care about. You can think I've got it all wrong I don't care anymore because what's done is done. Now you know how to avoid this in the future. Don't hurt yourself because it's not going to solve anything. Take care of yourself. Be grateful for the friends and family you have. If you need anything you have squad, don't let them slip away.

What the hell is your problem? BLAMING, CHEATING AND LYING to people is a good way for you. Are you even aware of the amount of bullshit you have done, how it has affected others? I can't believe that you accused him of being emotionally abusive towards you. It hasn't even been a week and already you're dating someone else. I bet you'll tell him LIES just so he can believe and protect you from such LIES. I bet you wanted him because of his looks, or of charms, or the way he talks to you, you probably barley know the man and he most likely barley knows anything about you. I like how the old one got you a promose ring and you said you loved him, but WAIT here's the kicker, you replaced him for someone else after 3 days and you probably only wanted him for attention or the dick after the brake up. I wonder, do you know anything about love? Did you know that in a relationship, both partners are supposed to care about the others emotions, are supposed to talk to each other, and not cheat and lie. I guess you didn't know better on that last part. You know your ruining your high school career, but that doesn't mean you just drag others down with you. Why ruin othrrs, along with yourself, with LIES. It' not healthy, you should really go see a therapist and see what's wrong with you . . .I would write more but nahh I think you got the message. My point is, just stop messing around with people's lives. Don't be blessed that you have good friends, at this point some of them are so done with your bullshit that they're basically just there so no drama will be aimed towards them. you may think you're innocent and not doing anything wrong, but you are and I hope you start to realize what fuck you're doing.

The mouse knows where it is at all times. It knows this because it knows where it isn't, by subtracting where it is, from where it isn't, or where it isn't, from where it is, whichever is greater, it obtains a difference, or deviation. The hand-mouse guidance system uses deviations to generate corrective commands to drive the mouse from a position where it is, to a position where it isn't, and arriving at a position where it wasn't, it now is. Consequently, the position where it is, is now the position that it wasn't, and it follows that the position where it was, is now the position that it isn't. In the event of the position that it is in is not the position that it wasn't, the system has required a variation. The variation being the difference between where the mouse is, and where it wasn't. If variation is considered to be a significant factor, it too, may be corrected by the hand. However, the mouse must also know where it was. The mouse guidance computance scenario works as follows: Because a variation has modified some of the information the mouse has obtained, it is not sure just where it is, however it is sure where it isn't, within reason, and it knows where it was. It now subracts where it should be, from where it wasn't, or vice versa. By differentiating this from the algebraic sum and where it shouldn't be, and where it was. It is able to obtain a deviation, and a variation, which is called "a fucking misclick the entire fleet is dead"

"SPONGEBOB, ME LAD, YOU HAVE TOO MANY ORIFICES FER YER OWN GOOD. YER GETTIN' A PROMOTION!" said Mr. Krabs as his hard red carapaced cock jabbed into the back of Spongebob's head.

"I feel like I'm absorbing some weird fluid," spluttered Spongebob as Krabs' nasty crustaceo-jizz poured from his mouth, nose and eyes.

"NOW EARN YOUR KEEP, LANDLUBBER," said Krabs as he grabbed Spongebob by his jizz-soaked trousers and began using him to clean the floor.

"Oh Mr. Krabs, I-"

"CALL ME MASTER YE BITCH"

Krabs stepped down hard in Spongebob and a puddle of his own jizz began spreading radially on the floor of the Krusty Krab.

"Hurgghbglbgblblgbl."

"CHOKE ON IT, YE INVERTEBRATE, OR I CAN'T GET HARRRRRRD. THESE CLAWS AREN'T JUST GOOD FER MATIN…OH, WAIT, YES THEY ARE," said Krabs as he caressed his eleventh leg.

The jizz began floating up toward the ceiling as Krabs brandished his seven-inch red masthead. You have to realize this is to scale, so it was about twice his body size.

Anyway, Squidward burst into the room wearing only a gimp suit and a tutu.

"TAKE ME MASTER, I NEED TO BE HUMILIATED," he said, as his four-millimeter calamari poked limply from the tight leather.

"TAKE THIS, THEN," said Krabs as he jabbed one of his prehensile eyestalks up Squidward's stankhole. Squidward moaned, rubbing himself gently with 5 of his tentacles.

"I CAN SEE YOU DON'T TAKE CARE OF YOUR HOLE VERY OFTEN," said Krabs. Patrick burst into the room wearing nothing but a smile and brandishing a towel. "DID SOMEBODY CALL THE HOLE DOCTOR?"

"Are you a real doctor?" asked Spoogebob.

"I went to community college," said Patrick as he forcibly yanked out Krabs' eyestalk and shoved it in his gay fat mouth.

"Hold this open, will ya?" said Patrick as he ripped off Spongebob's erect penis and used it to jam Squidward's hole open. It immediately grew back but smaller and wetter.

"Hmm... there's a lot of SHIT in here," said Patrick. "How much fiber is in Krabby Patties anyway?"

"YE WOULDN'T BELIEVE," said Krabs, as a gigantic turd stretched his red asshole until it tore.

"I NEED AN ENEMA," said Patrick. "OH WAIT WE'RE UNDERWATER." Patrick nibbled gently at the tip of Krabs' eyestalk as he released it from his mouth. He wiped eye fluid from the corner of his mouth and put Squidward's zippered lips to his own.

"ON THE COUNT OF THREE" said Patrick. "ONE… TWO… OH FUCK IT HNRRRRRRGGUUUUUUUUUUUUUUH!"

Patrick blew Squidward like a trumpet. All 8 of his tentacles went rigid and his squidjuice spilled out from the dick hole in his suit. The immense force started to blow crusty chunks of shit out of Squidward's ass.

"I must keep the Krusty Krab clean!" yelled Spoogebob as he rushed over and opened his mouth. Spongebob recognized bits of the Krabby Patty formula in his mouth as Squidward's acrid shit coated his tongue and teeth.

"SWALLOW, YE LANDLUBBER," said Krabs, poking his dick at Spongebob's lips.

"HMRGGRGHRGUHF," said Spongebob, shaking his head. He wanted to savor it, but Krabs had other plans.

Krabs got up on his desk and flexed. "GET READY" he yelled as he jumped down on Spongebob with a stone cold stunner. Blood, semen and shit sprayed powerfully from every one of Spongebob's holes. The force of the explosion tore both of his legs off. The assorted fluids and solids coated the walls of Krabs' office.

"YE GOT THAT SHIT ALL OVER ME FIRST DOLLAR," screeched Krabs. "AND YOU KNOW THERE'S ONLY ONE WAY TO CLEAN IT!"

Squidward, Patrick and Spongebob all begged at Krabs' knees, pleading to be the ones who got to lick the moist brown dollar. "THE FIRST ONES WHO CAN FIND SANDY AND SUCK OFF HER FUTA COCK GET TO LICK THE DOLLAR," decreed Krabs, stowing the dollar in his ass for safekeeping.

The three homos scrambled out of the room and towards the treedome.

**ONE HOUR LATER**

Spongebob, Patrick and Squidward approached the door of Sandy's tree house, not so much as an undergarment between them, and knocked politely on the door.

Sandy didn't respond, so Patrick broke down the door with his erect, barrel-like member.

"SANDY," they screamed, not caring about the lack of water. "SAAAAAANDY!"

Patrick picked up some mud and smeared it on his face. "I'M DIRTY DAN," he growled.

"I hope Dirty Dan likes getting RAMMED UP THE ASS," yelled Spongebob, as he thrust his supple yellow cattle prod into Patrick's chasmal pink rear. Patrick groaned in pleasure.

"Who you callin' pinhead?"

"SHUT THE FUCK UP! DIRTY DAN DOESN'T TALK," screamed Spongebob as he climaxed.

Patrick scooped out some of Spongebob's cum from his cavernous brown crevice and smeared it into Squidward's eyes. "YOU'RE DIRTY DAN!"

"UNGHHHH, IT HURTS SO GOOD!" Squidward smeared the semen into his eyes until they bled. Blood and semen gushed down his face.

"THIS REMINDS ME OF THAILAND," said Spongebob pensively, puffing on his pipe, which he fashioned out of one of his older penises.

Squidward enjoyed what remained of Spongebob's cum as Spongebob rode the tip of Patrick's voluminous horsehitch into Sandy's room. She was sleeping, but she looked like she had put on weight. Her futa cock was fully erect.

"LET'S RAPE HER," suggested Patrick, peeling Spongebob off his penis and throwing him violently against the wall.
"Wait Patrick, don't you know ANYTHING about squirrels?" cautioned Spongebob, ripping off his damaged member and growing a new one. He placed the damaged one on a necklace he was keeping.

"I KNOW THEY'RE EXCELLENT TARGETS FOR RAPE, ESPECIALLY WHILE THEY'RE SLEEPING," said Patrick as he jammed his holiday yule log into Sandy's ear. She was fast asleep and didn't seem to notice, but her cock twitched.

"It's called HIBERNATION, Patrick. Squirrels stuff valuable treasures into their vaginas and then go to sleep for six months."

"TREASURE? I WANT TREASURE" roared Patrick as he dove head-first into Sandy's gaping pussy. "UHH, I'M STUCK. WHERE'S THE TREASURE?"

"GO...DEEPER!" grunted Spongebob, giving Patrick a good shove.

"I CAN'T. I'M TOO FAT," he replied. "I'M REALLY HORNY THOUGH."

Spongebob chuckled. His plan had worked. Patrick was incapacitated and he was free to suck off Sandy's futa cock while she slept.

"SPONGEBOB? SPONGEBOB, WHAT ARE YOU DOING OUT THERE?" Patrick's muffled voice rang out from somewhere nearby, but Spongebob was enjoying Sandy's hard, flexible prick in his mouth.

Sandy rolled over and her dick went through the side of Spongebob's mouth and out one of his ear holes. "COME ON, DAMMIT, WHY WON'T YOU CUM?" muttered Spongebob as he moved himself sensually up and down the length of Sandy's anaconda.

At last, the sleeping squirrel climaxed, shooting hot greasy cum from Spongebob's ear. He pocketed some of it because he knew Krabs would require proof, probably while raping him violently.

"MMMRH? WHO SUCKED ME OFF?" murred Sandy as she rubbed her eyes.

"SPONGEBOB, YOU CHEATER!" yelled Patrick, his voice muffled by the squirrel's vaginal wall.

Spongebob ran as fast as his gay little legs would carry him out of Sandy's room. Squidward was attempting to fuck a tree.

To be fair, you have to have a very high IQ to understand The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim. The humour is extremely subtle, and without a solid grasp of theoretical physics and magic most of the jokes will go over a typical viewers head. There's also Belethor's nihilistic outlook, which is deftly woven into his characterisation- his personal philosophy draws heavily from Anthil Morvir and The Gourmet's literature, for instance. The fans understand this stuff; they have the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate the depths of these jokes, to realise that they're not just funny- they say something deep about LIFE. As a consequence people who dislike The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim truly ARE idiots- of course they wouldn't appreciate, for instance, the humour in the Guard's existential catchphrase "Then I Took An Arrow To The Knee," which itself is a cryptic reference to Marcius Carvain's Cyrodillic epic An Explorers Guide To Skyrim. I'm smirking right now just imagining one of those addlepated simpletons scratching their heads in confusion as Urag gro-Shub's genius wit unfolds itself on their computer screens. What fools.. how I pity them. 😂

And yes, by the way, i DO have an Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim tattoo. And no, you cannot see it. It's for the nord lasses' eyes only- and even then they have to demonstrate that they're within 5 IQ points of my own (preferably lower) beforehand. Nothin personnel kid 😎

A stentorian cacophony of turbulent sentiments wreaks havoc within as the addling admission is meticulously digested. Guileless astonishment is not among them, because this is not a revelation as much as it is a corroboration of a shrewd presupposition. Entrenched inquisitiveness compels her to ponder the precise thoughts that bestrew his shambolic mind. What exactly IS his perception of her? Begotten by the deleterious ramifications that might inauspiciously emerge should his enigmatic mentor become cognizant of this thorny development - if such a disquieting scenario has not already BECOME a direful actuality, there’s prudential trepidation. Is that not the crux of the matter of her inability to tarry here? Even so, the importunate enervation that commendable efforts to asphyxiate inextinguishable desires is diminished by his candor. She does not struggle in solitude, and there is inestimable relief to be gleaned from that knowledge. ❝ That makes TWO of us, but YOU’RE the more confusing one. ❞ An anomaly, an evanescent and diminutive smile that is unequivocally DEVOID of malicious noxiousness toys with intrepid lips.

EVERYONE seems to have provided either a partially or entirely inaccurate definition of what a Cleveland Steamer actually is. This classic and creative move is indeed a way to ensure that any desired break-up with a particular girl is accomplished without chance of reconciliation! Okay, THIS is how to perfectly execute a Cleveland Steamer: First, get your soon-to-be-ex drunk to the point of passing out. This serves two purposes. One, it allows you to precisely carry out the defecation on her chest without protest. Two, it almost assures that, because she drank so damn much, she will be even MORE sickened by the stench when she wakes in the morn. But back to the instructions. After passing out, the victim (girl) must be carefully placed in her bed with the covers pulled back. At this time, strip off her top and lay the longest, smokiest and smelliest logs possible directly on, around and between her tits. One may prep for this by eating lots of green vegetables, collard greens in particular, then smoking a pack of menthol cigarettes and eating jalapeno poppers at the same time. After dropping your shit pudding on her chest, and this is very important, pull the covers (preferably including at least two wool blankets and a down comforter) up over her head. If need be, leave her nostrils uncovered so that she won't suffocate. Then, after "blanketing" the smoking poo on her chest with as many covers as are available, turn the thermostat in her room up as high as it will go. If you can run that heat upwards of 90-95 degrees, DO IT! After a night of her poo pot pie literally baking on her chest under the multi-layered covers AND with a room temp of around 90 degrees, she will indeed wake to the smell in this steamy sauna of shit that will make her WISH she was engulfed by the smell of something much more tolerable, like the stench of rotting possum carcasses in the desert heat. THIS, my friends, is the REAL Cleveland Steamer!!!

(I'm a 14-year-old girl. I've just selected three CDs from various Stephen O’Mally projects, and head to the counter to make my purchase. The cashier is a middle-aged man.)

Cashier: "Are these for your dad?"

Me: "Actually, no, they're for me."

Cashier: "Uh, the Metallica CDs are over there." *points*

Me: "Yeah, well, I hate Metallica. I much prefer O’Mally’s work."

Cashier: "But girls your age are supposed to like Metallica!"

Me: "Yeah, well, I don't! I like O’Mally."

Cashier: "It's obvious that you have some sort of mental problem. It's not normal for girls your age to like drone."

(The manager has now approached the counter.)

Manager *to cashier* You! To my office now! *To me* "I'm so sorry about that. He shouldn't be talking to you that way. Personally, it's great to see kids that appreciate great music."

(He gave me 50% off for my troubles.)

Pumpingiron was taken so I settled? What's it too yah anyhow? We all make sacrifices in this world, some grander than others yah, but I've taken my licks. Was I dissapointed? Of course I was god dammnit but I'm getting by. I'm doing what I can day to day to get by. I can afford groceries. I have a home and a vehicle, I even got myself a woman who cares for me dearly.


So here's my question again and I'm going to be plain as all hell. What's your business judging ME for something I had almost no control over? Something that YOU think I should be ashamed of. Something that, now, whenever people are attracted by these comments are going to read YOUR comment and say. "Look at his username" or "What is his dense?" or "Doesn't he know he's some redundant asshole who is doubling down on a poorly thought out decision?" or "Wow this person must be some sort of jerk to have have the complacency to be unoriginal". And we both know that's what it's coming down to now. Online judgment.


Judge him for his name. Judgem for his writing. Jujjem for his fonts. Like who has the time do fancy fonts. NO, really I'm asking you and I want a response, do you? Would you even know how to?

When you type, "Hey..." and it autocorrects to:

"SPONGEBOB, ME LAD, YOU HAVE TOO MANY ORIFICES FER YER OWN GOOD. YER GETTIN' A PROMOTION!" said Mr. Krabs as his hard red carapaced cock jabbed into the back of Spongebob's head.

"I feel like I'm absorbing some weird fluid," spluttered Spongebob as Krabs' nasty crustaceo-jizz poured from his mouth, nose and eyes.

"NOW EARN YOUR KEEP, LANDLUBBER," said Krabs as he grabbed Spongebob by his jizz-soaked trousers and began using him to clean the floor.

"Oh Mr. Krabs, I-"

"CALL ME MASTER YE BITCH"

Krabs stepped down hard in Spongebob and a puddle of his own jizz began spreading radially on the floor of the Krusty Krab.

"Hurgghbglbgblblgbl."

"CHOKE ON IT, YE INVERTEBRATE, OR I CAN'T GET HARRRRRRD. THESE CLAWS AREN'T JUST GOOD FER MATIN…OH, WAIT, YES THEY ARE," said Krabs as he caressed his eleventh leg.

The jizz began floating up toward the ceiling as Krabs brandished his seven-inch red masthead. You have to realize this is to scale, so it was about twice his body size.

Anyway, Squidward burst into the room wearing only a gimp suit and a tutu.

"TAKE ME MASTER, I NEED TO BE HUMILIATED," he said, as his four-millimeter calamari poked limply from the tight leather.

"TAKE THIS, THEN," said Krabs as he jabbed one of his prehensile eyestalks up Squidward's stankhole. Squidward moaned, rubbing himself gently with 5 of his tentacles.

"I CAN SEE YOU DON'T TAKE CARE OF YOUR HOLE VERY OFTEN," said Krabs. Patrick burst into the room wearing nothing but a smile and brandishing a towel. "DID SOMEBODY CALL THE HOLE DOCTOR?"

"Are you a real doctor?" asked Spoogebob.

"I went to community college," said Patrick as he forcibly yanked out Krabs' eyestalk and shoved it in his gay fat mouth.

"Hold this open, will ya?" said Patrick as he ripped off Spongebob's erect penis and used it to jam Squidward's hole open. It immediately grew back but smaller and wetter.

"Hmm... there's a lot of SHIT in here," said Patrick. "How much fiber is in Krabby Patties anyway?"

"YE WOULDN'T BELIEVE," said Krabs, as a gigantic turd stretched his red asshole until it tore.

"I NEED AN ENEMA," said Patrick. "OH WAIT WE'RE UNDERWATER." Patrick nibbled gently at the tip of Krabs' eyestalk as he released it from his mouth. He wiped eye fluid from the corner of his mouth and put Squidward's zippered lips to his own.

"ON THE COUNT OF THREE" said Patrick. "ONE… TWO… OH FUCK IT HNRRRRRRGGUUUUUUUUUUUUUUH!"

Patrick blew Squidward like a trumpet. All 8 of his tentacles went rigid and his squidjuice spilled out from the dick hole in his suit. The immense force started to blow crusty chunks of shit out of Squidward's ass.

"I must keep the Krusty Krab clean!" yelled Spoogebob as he rushed over and opened his mouth. Spongebob recognized bits of the Krabby Patty formula in his mouth as Squidward's acrid shit coated his tongue and teeth.

"SWALLOW, YE LANDLUBBER," said Krabs, poking his dick at Spongebob's lips.

"HMRGGRGHRGUHF," said Spongebob, shaking his head. He wanted to savor it, but Krabs had other plans.

Krabs got up on his desk and flexed. "GET READY" he yelled as he jumped down on Spongebob with a stone cold stunner. Blood, semen and shit sprayed powerfully from every one of Spongebob's holes. The force of the explosion tore both of his legs off. The assorted fluids and solids coated the walls of Krabs' office.

"YE GOT THAT SHIT ALL OVER ME FIRST DOLLAR," screeched Krabs. "AND YOU KNOW THERE'S ONLY ONE WAY TO CLEAN IT!"

Squidward, Patrick and Spongebob all begged at Krabs' knees, pleading to be the ones who got to lick the moist brown dollar. "THE FIRST ONES WHO CAN FIND SANDY AND SUCK OFF HER FUTA COCK GET TO LICK THE DOLLAR," decreed Krabs, stowing the dollar in his ass for safekeeping.

The three homos scrambled out of the room and towards the treedome.

**ONE HOUR LATER**

Spongebob, Patrick and Squidward approached the door of Sandy's tree house, not so much as an undergarment between them, and knocked politely on the door.

Sandy didn't respond, so Patrick broke down the door with his erect, barrel-like member.

"SANDY," they screamed, not caring about the lack of water. "SAAAAAANDY!"

Patrick picked up some mud and smeared it on his face. "I'M DIRTY DAN," he growled.

"I hope Dirty Dan likes getting RAMMED UP THE ASS," yelled Spongebob, as he thrust his supple yellow cattle prod into Patrick's chasmal pink rear. Patrick groaned in pleasure.

"Who you callin' pinhead?"

"SHUT THE FUCK UP! DIRTY DAN DOESN'T TALK," screamed Spongebob as he climaxed.

Patrick scooped out some of Spongebob's cum from his cavernous brown crevice and smeared it into Squidward's eyes. "YOU'RE DIRTY DAN!"

"UNGHHHH, IT HURTS SO GOOD!" Squidward smeared the semen into his eyes until they bled. Blood and semen gushed down his face.

"THIS REMINDS ME OF THAILAND," said Spongebob pensively, puffing on his pipe, which he fashioned out of one of his older penises.

Squidward enjoyed what remained of Spongebob's cum as Spongebob rode the tip of Patrick's voluminous horsehitch into Sandy's room. She was sleeping, but she looked like she had put on weight. Her futa cock was fully erect.

"LET'S RAPE HER," suggested Patrick, peeling Spongebob off his penis and throwing him violently against the wall.
"Wait Patrick, don't you know ANYTHING about squirrels?" cautioned Spongebob, ripping off his damaged member and growing a new one. He placed the damaged one on a necklace he was keeping.

"I KNOW THEY'RE EXCELLENT TARGETS FOR RAPE, ESPECIALLY WHILE THEY'RE SLEEPING," said Patrick as he jammed his holiday yule log into Sandy's ear. She was fast asleep and didn't seem to notice, but her cock twitched.

"It's called HIBERNATION, Patrick. Squirrels stuff valuable treasures into their vaginas and then go to sleep for six months."

"TREASURE? I WANT TREASURE" roared Patrick as he dove head-first into Sandy's gaping pussy. "UHH, I'M STUCK. WHERE'S THE TREASURE?"

"GO...DEEPER!" grunted Spongebob, giving Patrick a good shove.

"I CAN'T. I'M TOO FAT," he replied. "I'M REALLY HORNY THOUGH."

Spongebob chuckled. His plan had worked. Patrick was incapacitated and he was free to suck off Sandy's futa cock while she slept.

"SPONGEBOB? SPONGEBOB, WHAT ARE YOU DOING OUT THERE?" Patrick's muffled voice rang out from somewhere nearby, but Spongebob was enjoying Sandy's hard, flexible prick in his mouth.

Sandy rolled over and her dick went through the side of Spongebob's mouth and out one of his ear holes. "COME ON, DAMMIT, WHY WON'T YOU CUM?" muttered Spongebob as he moved himself sensually up and down the length of Sandy's anaconda.

At last, the sleeping squirrel climaxed, shooting hot greasy cum from Spongebob's ear. He pocketed some of it because he knew Krabs would require proof, probably while raping him violently.

"MMMRH? WHO SUCKED ME OFF?" murred Sandy as she rubbed her eyes.

"SPONGEBOB, YOU CHEATER!" yelled Patrick, his voice muffled by the squirrel's vaginal wall.

Spongebob ran as fast as his gay little legs would carry him out of Sandy's room. Squidward was attempting to fuck a tree.

"Rick and Morty"? Only a plebeian worm such as yourself would engage in viewing broadcasts of such a sad and idiotic show. Unlike you low IQ apes, I please my optical sensors with only the finest of entertainment. I'll bet that you're inquiring as to what source of entertainment I am referring to. Although I don't expect you to comprehend it, the television show in question is "Young Sheldon". You see, the humor is vastly superior to that of "Rick and Morty". First of all "Rick and Morty" relies heavily on improvisional comedy, while the intellectual humor of "Young Sheldon" is scripted and well thought out before being presented to an audience. Second of all "Rick and Morty" is extremely unfaithful to its source material (Back to the Future, for you simpletons) while "Young Sheldon" is just as good if not better than watching "The Big Bang Theory". I could go on and on about how "Rick and Morty" is vastly inferior to "Young Sheldon" but I highly doubt that you have the mental capability to process such logic. So if you'll excuse me, I'm going to pour a glass of brandy whilst I redigest the latest episode of "Young Sheldon" so I can make an entry about it to the "Young Sheldon" wikia. Hopefully, I can forget about ever having the displeasure of interacting with you.*Sighs... How tedious.

IQ and understanding of quantum mechanics is completely different. IQ does not measure knowledge, but the ability to obtain and use knowledge.

The fans are not all brain wizzes. In fact from my life experience it is quite contrary. My dumbest friend who can't pass highschool math or English loves the show, whole other friends who are studying physics as I do and I would say are very smart do not watch the show. I'm not saying dumb people watch Rick in North, but rather not all Smart people watch the show and all people watching are not smart.

You can not say someone is smart based on the show they watched. No matter the show. It can be a lecture on gravitational waves by Steven Hawkings and the person watching can be dumb. I don't watch Rick and Morty. Not because I have other shows I like and prefer not to watch T.V.

Also to say "As a consequence people who dislike Rick & Morty truly ARE idiots" shows you are of a lower intelligence. To pass judgement on those who do not have similar interest is one of the qualities of someone with low intellect.

Personal story : 

Last summer there was a store that sold like a rock that was edible and I thought it was so weird

 But once I tried it it was so addicting and I all I mostly ate was that rock/sand thing with out realizing I started becoming thinner than I already am and I realized that rock thing was clogging my insides 

So I had to stop and I am so glad I did or I would’ve never been alive today Additctions like these are dangerous﻿

What the fuck did you just fucking say about me, you little bitch? I’ll have you know I graduated top of my class in the Equestrian Enthausiast Society, and I’ve been involved in numerous dressage competitions in the Olympics, and I have over 300 confirmed medals. I am trained in horse warfare and I’m the top galloper in the entire US cavalry forces. You are nothing to me but just another bar. I will jump the fuck over you with elegance the likes of which has never been seen before on this Earth, mark my fucking words. You think you can get away with saying that shit to me over the Internet? Think again, fucker. As we speak I am contacting my secret network of horse paper companies across the USA and my horse's weight is being accurately measured right now so you better prepare for the storm, maggot. The storm that tells your pathetic little face how much my horse weighs to the nanogram. You’re fucking academically dishonest, kid. I can be anywhere, anytime, and I can show you the papers in over seven hundred ways, and that’s just with my bare hands. Not only am I extensively trained in horse weighing, but I have access to the entire arsenal of the United States Mounted Cavalry Brigade and I will use it to its full extent to wipe your smug ass off the face of academic society, you little shit. If only you could have known what unholy retribution your little “clever” comment was about to bring down upon you, maybe you would have held your fucking tongue.

I suction cup my mouth to ricks bare anus cavity, when suddenly
WUBBALUBBADUBDUB
A transfer of his szechuan sauce right into my mouth and down my throat
GULP
I try to pull my head away to gasp for air but he won't let me, he reaches behind himself and forces the back of my head between his food machine more
"WUBBALUBBADUBDUB" 
"BURGERTIME"
"IM PICKLE RICK"
This definitely was more than just sauce being passed, I felt wet chunks blown in the back of my throat as he forcefully made me swallow them with my mouth still glued to his food machine
"Oh yea baby you like that, don't you little fuck boi, huh? Whos your grandpa? That's right, I'm you grandpa morty, now it's time for baby fuckboi to get his protein in. Open wide."
He said to me aggressively, as he forced another one out
AND THAT'S THE WAY THE NEWS GOES
What tasted like teriyaki and ketchup was ejected out of his 🅱️anus. I threw up in my mouth from the taste, but he kept my head and mouth firmly lodged between his Mc™buns so nothing left my mouth. There was no escaping this one
"P-PLEASE! R-RELE-EASE ME!"
I said with my mouth full of Oriental mcnugget sauce
he turned around, grinned a toothy grin, and simply shook his head, "NO!"
Fearing for my life, I swallowed his sauce, and he finally released me from his Mc™anus
GASPING FOR AIR
"So how's that for eating sauce?"
He said in a smug and condescending way

A little bit of backstory.

I started playing CS:GO around two or three years ago. When I first started out I already saw and knew firsthand that the game was going to be challenging. I knew that it was going to be difficult, but I am now at a loss.

As time went on, just as we all did, I began to learn about jailbreak, simon says, hopscotch and other things.

I began to learn the concept of being a warden, and using keybinds to look different directiosn

I've used almost every surf training map that they have out there which people have told me to use.

I've practiced my bhopping every day for weeks at a time.

I've done just about everything in the book that people have told me to try and get better. I've taken month long breaks, I've taken breathers, sit outs and all other manner of just underline resting periods.

I feel as though nothing has helped.

As much as I hate to admit it, it has also started to impact my personal life.

Friends, family and others tell me I don't act like how I used to. They say my personality has been changed and I notice it too.

I've sat awake at night thinking to myself, "Why do I keep trying to get better at something I know I'm no good at?"

But then I hear people tell me that I'm not necessarily bad but then I'm not necessarily good either.

All in all it has made me pretty emotionally upset and overall depressed me more often than not.

I can't quit. Not now. I feel like I've invested far too much time into the game to stop now. I don't know what goal I'm trying to reach, what possible end game I'm looking for that will finally sate this hunger to get better.

You sit there and wish that there was a magic word or something that could just make you better. But there is no such word.

I find myself sitting at Ralph's General Store day in and day out, thinking, plotting doing anything I can to try and think of how to get better.

I've tried calming myself down, steadily breathing, not getting uppity or angry yet I find it still doesn't work.

If I could put into words the level of discouragement I feel that has resulted from CS:GO, I would try. But I can't.

I guess the underline point is, is I'm ready to give up. I feel like everyone around me is better than me at everything. Surf shortcuts, silky pearl surfing, simon says, and whatever else.

It even feels like it has carried over into other games such as Fortnite and even offline games like Lego Dinos.

So if anyone has any suggestions or any advice to give I'd appreciate it.

Thanks.

-Dlec.

'Child love practice' is a term within pedophilia that describes special relationships between pedophiles and children, when love and care for children is being put into practice. This means loving children in the exact same way as an average teleiophile would love an adult partner, by being there for your lover and supporting her or him, while caressing, kissing, and enjoying consensus sex together with lusts and orgasms.
 
However, child love practice can be done at different levels, which means different levels of intensity and legality.
 
An important thing for novice child lovers to know, is that you can do a lot with a child before it actually becomes illegal in most countries. And you can even go pretty far and do illegal things without it being easily detected nor proved. You can actually go pretty far and experience delicious satisfactions without taking much of risks. Or, you may go for the very top level, have a penetrative sexual intercourse with a child, and risk everything to access the very core of God's Heaven.
 
There are 5 main levels of child love practice, each one containing allowed and restricted interactions with children:
 
Level 1 | very secure
 
The first level of child love practice is ideal for all newcomers who are just starting out being around and getting to know children, and probably the place where most pedophiles start at anyway when interacting with children.
 
Not to mention, being ideal for pedophiles who feel like they can't control their lusts fully when they're around children.
 
It's also an ideal level for anyone who have lots to loose in life, or a very important reputation to keep at status quo.
 
This level is limited to the following rules:
 

    Clothed physical contact only
    Never being alone with children (5-10 minutes at max)
    General physical play
        Hold hands
        Carry around
        Read books on the lap
    Careful hugging
    No kissing
    No intimate care / wash
    No intentional touching of genitals

 
This level is bulletproof and cannot put you in any trouble; unless someone is making false claims, which is quite rare.
 
Even if you should become tempted to push the boundaries, you have already made sure that other adults are around, while not being all that intimate with them in the first place, which will discourage and suppress such impulses.
 
But, it can become pretty frustrating for pedophiles to be around children, and interact with them both mentally and physically, while not being able to do anything; especially when it becomes more intimate, like reading books for young children on your lap. But, if you know about urge control, this level can be practiced comfortably, safely and securely.
 
It is very rewarding just being among children and having a great time together. Pedophiles are usually very popular among kids, because the kids detect their unique interest and love for them, which is a nice experience for all parties.
 
Many pedophiles stop at this level, just to be on the fully safe and comfortable side regarding the society and laws. Because, this level allows them to interact with children while sleeping perfectly well every single night.
 
Level 2 | reasonably secure
 
The second level of child love practice is all about pushing the limits just a little bit further, but still stay fully legal.
 
This is usually the next logical step for newbie child lovers to move to, or any other for that matter who wants more intimacy with children, as more intimacy this step will provide.
 
This level is limited to the following rules:
 

    Clothed physical contact only
    Being alone with children (for longer periods)
    General physical play
        Hold hands
        Carry around
        Read books on the lap
        Tickle the child's body
    Intimate hugging
    Intimate touching
    Smelling into the child's hair
    Kissing the child's face and mouth
    Intimate care and wash
        Help drying with toilet paper
        Change diapers
        Help with bathing
    No intentional touching of genitals

*The grayed out rules must still be enforced!
 
This is actually pretty close to the default child love level for regular parents, babysitters and daycare workers.
 
But, this level is not especially recommended for anyone who has a very important reputation to keep, as it will involve certain interactions that some people may look at as quite intimate; and probably a little bit too intimate if either the child isn't yours, or if it happens very often and intensively.
 
Whilst being fully legal interactions, the children may actually tell about the most intimate ones, which may cause some alarms to go off. Imagine little Sophia coming home from preschool and tells that uncle Joe, who works there, likes to kiss her mouth and tickle her a lot. Legal? Yes. Assuring? No.
 
You won't be sent to jail if something like the latter happens, but it can quickly become a scratch on your reputation, with various social and career related consequences.
 
And it's definitely not a recommended level for those who feel that they have trouble controlling their lusts around children; because when you start to e.g. kiss those red and wet little mouths, your sexuality may suddenly switch on fully.
 
But, this level will definitely make things way more intimate, thus way more rewarding for the pedophiles who can handle it and control themselves; being able to be all alone together, really squeeze them when hugging them, smelling them, feeling their lips onto yours when kissing, and both see them and legally touch them in all nude during intimate care.
 
Level 3 | less secure
 
The third level of child love practice is the first level that actually becomes sexual. In other words, you will now get an orgasm while being close to and intimate with a child. Though, you will only touch yourself, not the child's genitals.
 
This is the next natural step to take for most 2nd level child lovers who want to go further with child love practice, and experience sexual releases while interacting with kids.
 
The main part of this level is to masturbate yourself while doing any of the listed activities below. And ideally, hide it so neither the child nor anyone else detects it.
 
This level is limited to the following rules:
 

    Clothed physical contact only
    Being alone with children for longer periods
    General physical play
        Hold hands
        Carry around
        Read books on the lap
        Tickle the child's body
    Intimate hugging
    Intimate touching
    Smelling into the child's hair
    Kissing the child's face and mouth
    Intimate care and wash
        Help drying with toilet paper
        Change diapers
        Help with bathing
    No intentional touching of genitals
    Masturbate yourself
        While the child doesn't notice it
        While the child sleeps

*The grayed out rules must still be enforced!
 
This level is less secure of obvious reasons: the child may notice that your behavior changes, thus become unsure about you, or even scared of you. You may also get caught by the child, or by any adult around, while satisfying yourself. And neither scenario will become pleasant to experience.
 
This is referred to as passive sexual abuse in court, and is considered as fully illegal by law, in most countries.
 
However, it will become enormously hard taking you to court and prove what you did. Thus, most pedophiles who do get caught for this, do get away with it. But your social status and whole life in general will nevertheless change for the worse.
 
But, and a quite big one that is, if you manage to keep this hidden from the child and your surroundings, you will actually be able to have passive sex with children, and thus experience something extremely wonderful as a genuine pedophile. And if being very careful, you can keep on doing this forever, thus get lots of sexual rewards in your life, in the same time as staying safe, unconcerned and happy.
 
This is a very great level to stop at if you want to stay as safe as possible, while still being able to experience sex with kids.
 
Level 4 | dangerous
 
The fourth level of child love practice is the level that becomes fully sexual, and the child will be introduced to sex while being fully conscious about it.
 
When a child is fully aware about what happens, you will get a 2-way sexual relationship, which is a very powerful experience for a genuine pedophile: not only will you be fiddling with children and getting orgasms while doing so, but you will also be communicating sexually. You'll smile at each other, giggle, whisper, and see how the child responds to caressing, touching and sexual stimuli. This is a whole new playground for all pedophiles to set themselves loose within.
 
This level is limited to the following rules:
 

    Clothed physical contact only
    Being alone with children for longer periods
    General physical play
        Hold hands
        Carry around
        Read books on the lap
        Tickle the child's body
    Intimate hugging
    Intimate touching
    Smelling into the child's hair
    Kissing the child's face and mouth
    Intimate care and wash
        Help drying with toilet paper
        Change diapers
        Help with bathing
    Masturbate yourself
        While the child doesn't notice it
        While the child sleeps
        While the child notices it or looks at you
    Practicing sex with children
        Masturbate the child
        Get masturbated by the child
    No penetration

*The grayed out rules must still be enforced!
 
However, things become very risky and illegal at this level, as this is the first level that introduces prison time as a possible risk, making it a less ideal step for the faint hearted pedophiles who got a lot to loose in life.
 
But, this is also the level that many pedophiles think it's worth dying for; because there are no real comparisons in life to having real sex with real children as genuine pedophiles.
 
And since penetration is forbidden at this level, you can't be prosecuted for premature rape, which usually limits the consequences and prison time significantly if caught.
 
Of course, you may have sex with a child while it's asleep, which might seem safer to many of you, but can actually become less safe than if the child actually had been awake:
 
Because, there will always be that risk of the child waking up while you're doing it, thus suddenly finding itself in a critical situation that it wasn't prepared for at all, causing it to freak out in many different ways. Some children have even pretended to be asleep, in pure fear of what's happening, and then told about it the very next day to another adult. Thus, sleeping kids aren't as safe as most probably think.
 
Having sex with sleeping children isn't a problem however, if the children are already introduced and used to sex in their awaken states. Sometimes it can be nice to have sex with sleeping children, who're quite active and restless in their awaken states, giving you the opportunity to enjoy them while being all calm and still, and enjoy them over very long and intense sessions, like warm little play dolls.
 
Level 5 | highly dangerous
 
The fifth level of child love practice is the level that goes all the way to town. This is where penetration will occur, as in sliding slowly into a wet kiddie mouth, or a wet and supertight kiddie vagina or bum, and ejaculate far inside it.
 
This step is the ultimate step for all genuine pedophiles who are fully dedicated and committed to go all the way and live their lives to the very fullest. This is the last and highest level of child love practice, and it doesn't get any further nor higher.
 
The following initial rules, and beyond, are now allowed:
 

    Clothed physical contact only
    Being alone with children for longer periods
    General physical play
        Hold hands
        Carry around
        Read books on the lap
        Tickle the child's body
    Intimate hugging
    Intimate touching
    Smelling into the child's hair
    Kissing the child's face and mouth
    Intimate care and wash
        Help drying with toilet paper
        Change diapers
        Help with bathing
    Masturbate yourself
        While the child doesn't notice it
        While the child sleeps
        While the child notices it or looks at you
    Practicing sex with children
        Masturbate the child
        Get masturbated by the child
    Full penetration
        Oral
        Vagina
        Anal

 
Any sexual penetration of children equals premature rape by most laws worldwide, and is the ultimate crime to commit with the worst consequences and hardest prison times.
 
But, this risk is the price you'll have to pay to experience fully sexual intercourses with children, all the way from babies to adolescents, and enter the very core of God's Heaven.
 
If you can live with the risk of getting caught for something like this, this is the level to proceed to. The sexual satisfaction that you get from such child love practice goes far beyond any stimulating drugs available on this planet; which usually puts most fears in its shadow anyway, sooner or later.
 
The Bottom Line
 
As you now have learned, child love practice can actually be done on several different and specific levels.
 
Ideally, you should choose one level that fits you best, and stick to that level and its rules. Of course, you are free to move to a higher level whenever you feel like in the future.
 
However, knowing what level to enter and stay on can become quite difficult for newbies. This is a decision that you'll have to make all by your own, by thinking thoroughly through your life and what you can afford loosing in it and not, and how much you're willing to sacrifice to experience the sort of child love practice that you want the most.
 
The most interesting level however, is probably the 3rd level, as it is relatively safe to practice while still being extremely powerful regarding excitement, sexual arouse and release.
 
Just remember the simple rule of child love levels: the higher you go, the less secure your life becomes, but the closer to Heaven you do get.
 
Most importantly, this security guide, and whole handbook in general, will help you go all the way, while staying as safe and prepared as one can possibly be. There are so many pedophiles who're enjoying Level 5 child love practice as we speak, and is free as birds and happy as lottery billionaires.
 
It's all about security and preparations, so keep on reading...

What's that, you made a fucking OkCupid, a little dating profile? You expect to find your next hookup? Well, let me take a moment to congratulate you, the monkey learned a trick. Look at you, uploading pictures, spewing your vile filth all over this website, huh? Congratulations! You must have have an IQ in the double digits! Here's a little piece of advise, slick: next time you're gonna ghost me, a gr8 person? Just make sure you don't pick Ellie Parker, daughter of the Papa Parker Pizza empire. I have bought people like you. I have destroyed people like you. It's nothing for me to call up my father and have every pizza jockey in the nation have a photo of you, right above their oven. Thinking about you, my personal army of pizza makers. They'll put sauce on you. They'll lay you out. They'll swing you around in the air just like in the old movies.

Then they'll destroy you.

Piece by piece. Piece by delicious piece. Cheesy piece by cheesy crust piece. They'll destroy you. That's option one. Option two is you can apologize to me. Just say you're sorry. Takes a big man to apologize, don't it? Humble yourself before a goddess, a pizza goddess?

Anyway. That's about it. Go fuck yourself.

I think the universal theme expressed in both Boku no Pico and Rick and Morty plays an important role throughout both works. They share the motifs of a twisted sense of love and affection. In the case of Rick and Morty it is seen in their relationship where Rick needs Morty in possibly an emotionally manner but also in an unethical way (as seen in the show when the mortys are shown to be used as a pain field). Boku no Pico resembles this in that the relationship may not be wholly ethical or morally accepted in some cases but many are still attracted to this because their themes can be applied to the real world. Is love and morals in our world not as twisted? Both media productions express this- while a bit different- and while many viewers might see these two as “stupid” they just lack the knowledge and education to analyze the underlying themes and deeper meanings behind the grotesque humor and adult themed intercourse

Okay I know Unblocked Fawn.
He isn't 8 he is 12.
And just because he is a bit young that doesn't mean you should talk shit about him.
You sound a lot fucking younger than he does and it isn't just your voice that sounds young... you sound so immature.
What he is saying isn't getting through that thick skull of yours. 
I have no respect for some little kid like you sitting on the fucking internet and picking out every little thing you don't like and calling people out for it. You have no fucking right, you do the same fucking thing Leafy does and see where he is at now? Not many people watch his fucking content anymore. 

Since I'm an actual human being with feelings I decided to give your content a chance.
But your poor choice of words, your bad editing, your sick insults, got me to the point where I couldn't even watch it anymore. 

At least Fawn has a decent opinion on things and made a point.
Fawn can be aggressive with his words some times and he may of repeated himself a lot.
But he is a really good kid.
And you have no fucking right to bully anyone. 
Your content is complete trash. And your one of the biggest hypocrites I've ever seen.
Go do something else besides sitting on your computer and making fun of people.
Go find  REAL FUCKING SKILL besides sitting on your computer making videos where you bully people and most of the words you chose is "Retarded" And the way you use it is incorrect.

BUT HERE IS WHERE AS A DECENT HUMAN BEING I WILL SIDE WITH YOU ON SOMETHING.
Because as a content creator you should have the decentcy to treat someone as an actual human being and not a play thing that you can let your anger out by calling them names and making them feel shitty.

I notied a lot of the comments here... and your all fucking idiots to be honest.
Telling some kid that you don't know to kill themselves is completley just unnacceptable.
I bet most of the people who said it are adults.
Is your life really that low and pathetic that you have to tell a child to kill themselves?
And your making fun of his weight?
WHAT THE HELL GIVES YOU THE RIGHT TO MAKE FUN OF SOMEONE FOR THAT?
Being fat or overweight doesn't make you less of a person and you have no fucking right to make fun of them for it.
How about you all get a FUCKING BRAIN and take time to actually make a solid and real point and make REAL criticism instead of making yourselves look as bad as this kid calling other people names and making fun of their content (even though his content is really terrible)

Act like decent human beings and just stop acting like little children in pre-school making fun of eachother because of one or several little thing we don't like about them.

None of the college age kids can speak correctly, write a coherent sentence, and NEVER do ANY homework. I'm forced to do group work with them and it's unbelievable. As a result, all the classes are taught at a middle school level. My teacher accused me of copying out of the book because my grammar was correct. One of our Earth Science "experiments" was holding dry soil in a cup, then adding water, and writing down which was heavier. Seriously. I knew going in the teachers are liberal - but every teacher automatically assumes the kids are on board with their far left beliefs. And they are! I don't know what politics has to do with Science, but my Earth Science teacher said on the first day "I'm a lefty (to applause) and you're going to see the issues that matter to ME". What an EGO! Who the hell cares! That's how important agenda - in any setting - is to them! I would never have the gall to batter my political beliefs into anyone - let alone a whole class. Geez. This has to be the result of the Dewey "create a better citizen" or dead-head automoton who obeys, doesn't question and worships authority. It's a shame. What will these kids do for work?

My co-worker is the most annoying guy in the world.  I wish to God I wasn’t so nice to him when I first started working at my new job.  I should have wondered why he was so overly nice at the start.  I thought it was just good manners but it was purely desperation. You see, the guy is a douchebag, alright?  There, I said it.  All the other co-workers round on him like he’s diseased and now I’m stuck with him and don’t know how to get rid of him.  I don’t mean to sound mean and I know I probably do but you don’t understand.
For example, every morning when I get to the office, I go into the break room for my morning cup of coffee, this is MY moment, the moment I take before dealing with my idiot of a manager and all the other bastards I have to smile at and report to.

How? Sorry but Jack obviously should not be on this list. These people are mean, annoying, ungrateful, an undeserving people. Sean is my personal favorite YouTuber, and he loves and cares for his fans. A lot of these people put on a mask for their video's, trying to act like someone they're not. But Sean? No. You can tell that Jacksepticeye is honest and genuine in his video's, and has willingly said that he is childish. He has put a message out every single milestone video he makes, when he sees the " Congratulations and thank you Sean, you helped me out so much and you make me so happy." comments on social media when he hits those milestones, he says something along the lines of no thank you, you guys got me here, I wouldn't be here if I didn't have you guys supporting me, he honestly cares. This number pisses me off, check your facts before you say stuff like that.

Before doing a chick, you fish one of your roommate's used condoms from the trash, turn it inside-out, and put it on. When the chick gets pregnant, you say, "It ain't mine!"

"Janice thought I got her pregnant during our one night stand, but it's probably my roommate's because I gave her the ol' Cincinnati Switcheroo."

The alt-right and the alt-left are both stupid. They lack a clear understanding of who they are, and that's a hate group. I, however, am not a sheep who watches FOX or CNN. I watch Rick and Morty, as that is all I need. R&M teaches nihilism. For simple minded people like most of you, Nihilism is the belief that all values are baseless and that nothing can be known or communicated. Now I hear some of you say that you believe in this philosophy, but a true nihilist would believe in nothing, have no loyalties, and no purpose other than, perhaps, an impulse to destroy. And as some Internet trolls will say, NIHILISM IS NOT VIOLENT!!! IF I HEAR ONE MORE OF YOU IDIOTS CALLING OUT THIS PERFECT AND TRUE PHILOSOPHY, I WILL THROW YOUR HEAD IN A WALL!

Hey, my name is Zach, or Capn as most people call me. I'm at the ripe old age of 15, and I have fallen in love with video games. I play them whenever possible, and I recently started cheating. This is probably one of my favorite cheats because it gives you the most bang for your buck. Now lets get into my resume. I have been admin of a few servers, including gaming servers such as ones on Gmod, CSGO, and Minecraft (unfortunately). I can demonstrate good helping abilities and very good people skills that will make the community a better place to be. Aside from jsut gaming leadership experience, I am a Star Scout and I have worked for years as a Den Chief where I am a leader for younger cub scouts. I am currently with Troop 55 out of Houston, TX and I do many community services with them and on my own time. I am a sophomore in Highschool, and I am a Straight A student without trying too hard which means I have a lot of time for helping everyone out. In school I do Model UN so I am very good at being diplomatic and explain everything well. This allows me to help out people who are confused and instead of further progression a problem. I have already started helping people and making connections with the community. If you ask around Im sure you will find somebody who I have helped out with the cheat at one point or another.
While all of this might not be the best "coding" or "cheating" experience, I do have the leadership and helpfulness in me, plus I love to learn and grow. I hope I can learn more about how everything works so I can better help my fellow cheaters in the penguware community. Now that all of my resume is over, lets talk about other stuff. I have an amazing sense of humor (at least I think so) and can be sarcastic at times, but I know when the right time and place  is, so I wont make people confused about rules or anything important. I can fluently speak English and can do conversational Spanish as well. Other than that, I am also a beast with google translate so I've got the languages down. Finally I'd just like to say that this is an amazing community with fabulous members and staff, and hopefully I can become a part of the staff to make it even more fabulous.

Hello I'm Seth the programmer, An with me it's chuck the CyberCUCK but don't mind too much about him he's just here to kiss my ass and to do the research I'm too lazy to do on my own because it's for a character from a series I have no interest in, and of course I didn't even do any effort for verifying the information that he gave even do if I cared about accurate facts as much as I claim I do I would check the information thats given to me, but no I just take whatever he gives me at face value, because as much as we keep saying that we are god tier vs debaters we never put any actual debate in our videos we are just a couple of douchebags that automatically agrees with whatever the other onbe said, while we treat anyone with a different opinion like he was a complete retard, but don't bother to call us out for that because we'll deny that we did that.

Today we're gonna debunk Screwattack's naruto vs ichigo, because as always they have proven to be complete idiots that don't know anything, because its a fact that naruto its faster than light for that one time he dodged an attack that was stated to be like a flash of light, of course this statement its vague as fuck and it doesn't in anyway proves that the attack was moving at the speed of light, but you see What a call research its nothing but a logical fallacy called confirmation bias in which I looked specically for the information that backs up my opinion, no matter how flimsy or questionable it is, while dismissing all other data that contradics it even if it far more numerous and I have no real argument agains them other that making up something to disprove it without even showing any evidence to support my claims but it doesn't matter you're all either bias, gullible or insane enough to blindly believe in anything that I tell you anyway, I'll also claim that naruto its planet level because of a ghide that says that a secondary character that doesn't directly relate to him is planet level, and also if you pay attention to his calculation for naruto speed its pretty clear that even by their own lowballed calculation they were downplaying naruto's speed even though the thing that I'm pointing to its nothing but a typo that anyone that check the actual formula that they did to calculate his speed at base form should be able clarify and realize that the end result its actually correct, but of course you're not gonna do that you're just gonna inmidiatly do the same thing that I did and assume the worst just because you hate them so much that you're willing to inmidiatly believe any bad thing anyone says about them, I'm also gonna take into account a feat from a videogame even do I called them out from doing that with android 18, it doesn't matter my fanboys will still defend me even when I'm being a blatant hypocrite.

And because of all of that naruto should have won... wait he did won oh well I'll still put out my "debunk" just bitching about how he should have stomp harder or I'll just of a sudden change my veredict just to spite them, and say thet they screw over ichigo even though I'll still spend most of the video complaining about naruto while barely touching upon ichigo and without even giving any reasoning as to why he should have won, but Of course my legion of mindless sheeps will take this as proof of me being not bias even though I still have a cartoon of my punching superman as my intro, not only showcasing my intense hatefull spite and favoritism but also my massive ego, because I'm the definition of an internet tough guy, I project myself like an invincible badass while in reality I'm too much of a bitch to even show my face, hell even my avatar has a mask, and I always have someone else with me on my debunk videos because I don't dare to attack someone else's content unless I feel like I have someone else to back me up.

And also thanks for all the support you guys thanks to fanboys like you I can just live by obsessing over japenese cartoons instead ever doing anything actually productive with my life, you make me feel like I was a legend or a celebrity when in reality I'm a nobody that no one its gonna remember 20 years from now

First, be smart from the very beginning. Pulverize all teeth, burn off fingerprints, and disfigure the face. Forcing a DNA test to establish identity (if it ever comes to that) might introduce the legal/forensic hurdle that saves your ass down the line. An unidentifiable body can, in a pinch, be dressed in thrift store clothes and dropped in a bad part of town where the police are less likely to question it. I don't recommend that disposal method, I'm just saying an easily identifiable body is an even bigger threat than the opposite. Assuming you have it inside a house where you can work on it a bit, the first thing you want to do is drain it of fluids. This will make it easier to cut up, and slow decomposition a little bit. The best way to do this quick and dirty is to perforate the body with a pointed knife and then perform CPR on it. Cut the fronts of the thighs deep & diagonally to slit the femoral arteries; then pump the chest. The valves in the heart will still work when dead, and the springback of the ribcage can put apply a fair amount of suction to the artria. Do this in a tub. Plug the drain and mingle lots of bleach with the bodily fluids before unplugging the drain to empty the tub. This should help control the stench of death, which would otherwise reek from your gutter gratings. Do everything you can to control odors. Plug in an ionizer, burn candles, leave bowls of baking soda everywhere. Ventilate the room in the middle of the night, but otherwise keep it closed. Keep the body under a plastic sheet while it's in the tub. If you want to bury, I recommend seperating the body into several parts and burying them seperately. For one thing, it's easier to dig a deep enough hole for a head than for an entire body. This reduces your chances of being discovered while you are actually outside and digging the grave. That is the one thing you can't do inside the doors of your house, and represents a vulnerable moment you want to keep brief, under 2 hours. Do it between 3 and 5 am. It's also less likely for someone to call the police if their dog digs up some chunk of meat than if they dig up an enitre body. They may assume it's an animal carcass disfigured by decomposition, and leave it alone or dispose of it. It's also more likely that the dog will consume all of it before anyone knows the difference. A whole skeleton is another story. You can cut a body into 6 pieces faster than you think. It's not much different than boning a chicken, but it takes more work, a big knife, and time. A hammer will be useful for pulverizing joints or driving the knife deep where it doesn't want to go. Anyway it's wise to crush as much of the skeleton as you can along the way. It will aid in making the body less identifiable for what it is as it decomposes. Don't return to the same site 6 times for 6 burials.You'll attract suspicion from anyone nearby, and you'll wind up placing the body parts close enough together to be found by any serious investigation. Put them in plastic bags with lots of bleach, and store in a freezer until you have enough time to bury them all. Depending on what tools you have available, you may find that you're get really good at deconstructing the body. You might prefer to slowly sprinkle it down a drain without leaving your house. This avoids the long-term risk of discovery associated with burial, and the overwhelming supply of bacteria in a sewer accellerates deconomposition while providing a convenient cover smell. Truly grinding down a body takes a lot more work, and you run the risk of fouling your plumbing and calling in a plumber. So don't try it unless you know how to clear bones and meat out of a drainpipe. A good food processor can be useful. But don't over-use it, or power drills or saws. They're noisy and they attract attention. And forget the kitchen sink. It's better if you actually remove one of the toilets in your house from its base, which will give you direct access to one of the largest sewer pipes that enters your house. Follow any disposals with lots of bleach and then run the water for 5 or 10 minutes on top of that. And plug that pipe when you're not using it, to prevent any sewer gasses from backing up into your house. Usually, a U-trap inside the toilet does that for you.

Funny you complain about manners when a guy calls me cancer for liking a certain tv show. LOL. At least my points make sense unlike yours. Please tell me where my grammar mess ups were. Maybe I have a dialect but I do not have grammar issues.  For a side note that "garbage show " is the most highly rated and viewed manga asides from the One Piece. So you are telling me at least 1 million people are " pure cancer. " Ridiculous. You watch a trash show like One Punch Man and dare to compare it to the great Naruto. One Punch Man ranked 21 last time I checked. Naruto is not even my favorite show. Assumptions are made quite a lot by the people of the internet. Especially by you Saitama jock riders that have no credence to your argument.﻿

No amount of 'tips' can save this language now. C++ never had a clear goal. The features of C++ were added almost at random. Stroustrup's original idea was essentially "C is cool and OOP is cool so let's bolt OOP onto C". Retrospectively, OOP was massively overhyped and is the wrong tool for the job for most of the people most of the time. Half of the GoF design patterns just emulate idioms from functional programming. Real OOP languages like Smalltalk and IO express many useful things that C++ cannot. The feature that C needed most was perhaps parametric polymorphism (aka generics in Java and C#, first seen in ML in the late 1970s) but instead of that C++ got templates that weren't designed to solve any particular problem but rather to kind of solve several completely unrelated problems (e.g. generics and metaprogramming). Someone actually discovered by accident that C++ templates are Turing complete and they wrote and published a program that computed prime numbers at compile time. Wow. A remarkable observation that led to decades of template abuse where people used templates to solve problems much better solved by other pre-existing solutions such Lisp macros and ML polymorphism. Worse, this abuse led to even more language features being piled on top, like template partial specialization.
The massive incidental complexity in C++ made it almost impossible to write a working compiler. For example, it remains extremely difficult to write a parser for the C++ language. The syntax also has horrible aspects like List<Set<int>> being interpreted as logical shift right. None of the original C++ compilers were reliable. Only after two decades did we start to see solid C++ compilers (by which time C++ was in decline in industry due to Java and C#).
C++ is said to be fast but the reality is that C++ is essentially only fast when you write C-like code and even then it is only fast for certain kinds of programs. Due to the "you don't pay for what you don't use" attitude, C++ is generally inefficient. RAII injects lots of unnecessary function calls at the end of scope, sometimes even expensive virtual calls. These calls often require data that would otherwise be dead so the data are kept alive, increasing register pressure and spilling and decreasing performance. The C++ exception mechanism is very inefficient (~6x slower than OCaml) because it unwinds the stack frame by frame calling destructors rather than long jumping. Allocation with new and delete is slow compared to a modern garbage collector so people are encouraged to use STL collections but these pre-allocate huge blocks of memory in comparison so you've lost the memory-efficiency of C and then you are advised to write your own STL allocator which is no better than using C in the first place. One of the main long-standing advantages of C over modern languages is the unpredictable latency incurred by garbage collectors. C++ offers the worst of both worlds by not having a garbage collector (making it impossible to leverage useful concepts like purely functional data structures properly) but it encourages all destructors to avalanche so you get unbounded pause times (worse than any production GC). Although templates are abused for metaprogramming they are very poor at it and C++ has no real support for metaprogramming. For example, you cannot write an efficient portable regular expression library in C++ because there is no way to do run-time code generation and compilation as you can in Java, C# and languages dating back to Lisp (1960). So while Java and C# have had regular expressions in their standard libraries for well over 10 years, C++ only just got them and they are slow.
C++ is so complicated that even world experts make rookie mistakes with it. Herb Sutter works for Microsoft and sits on the C++ standards committee where he influences the future of C++. In a lecture he gave his favorite 10-line C++ program, a thread-safe object cache.
My personal feeling is that the new Rust programming language is what C++ should have been. It has useful known features like generics, discriminated unions and pattern matching and useful new features like memory safety without garbage collection.

A little bit of backstory.

I started playing CS:GO around two or three years ago. When I first started out I already saw and knew firsthand that the game was going to be challenging. I knew that it was going to be difficult, but I am now at a loss.

As time went on, just as we all did, I began to learn callouts, tactics, plays and other things.

I began to learn the concept of jigglepeeking, strafing etc.

I've used almost every aim training map that they have out there which people have told me to use.

I've practiced my spraypatterns every day for weeks at a time.

I've done just about everything in the book that people have told me to try and get better. I've taken month long breaks, I've taken breathers, sit outs and all other manner of just underline resting periods.

I feel as though nothing has helped.

As much as I hate to admit it, it has also started to impact my personal life.

Friends, family and others tell me I don't act like how I used to. They say my personality has been changed and I notice it too.

I've sat awake at night thinking to myself, "Why do I keep trying to get better at something I know I'm no good at?"

But then I hear people tell me that I'm not necessarily bad but then I'm not necessarily good either.

All in all it has made me pretty emotionally upset and overall depressed me more often than not.

I can't quit. Not now. I feel like I've invested far too much time into the game to stop now. I don't know what goal I'm trying to reach, what possible end game I'm looking for that will finally sate this hunger to get better.

You sit there and wish that there was a magic word or something that could just make you better. But there is no such word.

I find myself sitting and my desk day in and day out, thinking, plotting doing anything I can to try and think of how to get better.

I've tried calming myself down, steadily breathing, not getting uppity or angry yet I find it still doesn't work.

If I could put into words the level of discouragement I feel that has resulted from CS:GO, I would try. But I can't.

I guess the underline point is, is I'm ready to give up. I feel like everyone around me is better than me at everything. Aiming, playstyle, peeking, whatever else.

It even feels like it has carried over into other games such as PUBG and even offline games like Fallout.

So if anyone has any suggestions or any advice to give I'd appreciate it.

Thanks.

-Asher.

That’s so sad that you know that. Without looking it up, can you name your state representative and what bills they’re backing in Congress? You should stop keeping up with trash and keep up with the real world. Congress is about to vote on net neutrality, they’re gonna eviscerate our internet, where does your Congressman stand on that issue? Have you called your state representative to let them know where you stand? Oh but you have time to follow the Kartrashians every move you must have 5 minuets for reality.

I hate exclusives, I mean seriously, without those exclusives console gaming is dead, I don't hate consoles but I think they're the only reason consoled still exist as custom PCs are better (although they typically cost more) I love halo, the last of us and the uncharted series but there's no way I will buy a ps4 to play the sequels, I'll just wait to pi rate the copies which I hate doing because I love supporting good game developers but I don't like supporting the bad behaviors of exclusives, microtrasnactions, and releasing a non full game claiming parts of the game locked behind dlc, dlc is good if it's content that adds to the main experience, in all honesty I think no dlc should be released until a month after the game preventing the main story/game from being sold as dlc, we don't need people to control these industries, VOTE WITH YOUR WALLET do no support microtrasnactions, exclusives or outrageous dlc (some is Okay!) Otherwise gaming as we all know it will change into a lackluster cash grab with little to no effort made by producers and that is a future I hope to avoid, let's create a buyers market, one where if a corp. Does something nasty like WB we all boycott the game/microtrasnactions at least

First designed by Shigetaka Kurita in 1999, emojis have become an international phenomenon, transcending and augmenting phonetic text in the realm of digital communication much in the same way music transcends and augments phonetic text in a song.

By expanding the inherent humanity these anthropomorphic icons possess to the theatrical narrative form, Emojiland reveals itself as not only a spellbinding adventure in an epically imaginative world, but an equally striking meditation on what it means to be alive.

Emojiland features a “groundbreaking” musical score by Keith and Laura Harrison, whose diverse musical collaborators have included Ariana Grande, Babyface, Emmylou Harris, and Heather Headley, among others.  Drawing from musical styles contemporary to the source material, as well as classic theatre influences, the show is as satisfyingly eclectic as it is brilliantly cohesive.

In Emojiland, interconnected struggles of emojis living inside a smartphone escalate after a software update, threatening to wipe out Emojiland altogether.

I was shooting heroin and reading “The Fountainhead” in the front seat of my privately owned police cruiser when a call came in. I put a quarter in the radio to activate it. It was the chief.

“Bad news, detective. We got a situation.”

“What? Is the mayor trying to ban trans fats again?”

“Worse. Somebody just stole four hundred and forty-seven million dollars’ worth of bitcoins.”

The heroin needle practically fell out of my arm. “What kind of monster would do something like that? Bitcoins are the ultimate currency: virtual, anonymous, stateless. They represent true economic freedom, not subject to arbitrary manipulation by any government. Do we have any leads?”

“Not yet. But mark my words: we’re going to figure out who did this and we’re going to take them down … provided someone pays us a fair market rate to do so.”

“Easy, chief,” I said. “Any rate the market offers is, by definition, fair.”

He laughed. “That’s why you’re the best I got, Lisowski. Now you get out there and find those bitcoins.”

“Don’t worry,” I said. “I’m on it.”

I put a quarter in the siren. Ten minutes later, I was on the scene. It was a normal office building, strangled on all sides by public sidewalks. I hopped over them and went inside.

“Home Depot™ Presents the Police!®” I said, flashing my badge and my gun and a small picture of Ron Paul. “Nobody move unless you want to!” They didn’t.

“Now, which one of you punks is going to pay me to investigate this crime?” No one spoke up.

“Come on,” I said. “Don’t you all understand that the protection of private property is the foundation of all personal liberty?”

It didn’t seem like they did.

“Seriously, guys. Without a strong economic motivator, I’m just going to stand here and not solve this case. Cash is fine, but I prefer being paid in gold bullion or autographed Penn Jillette posters.”

Nothing. These people were stonewalling me. It almost seemed like they didn’t care that a fortune in computer money invented to buy drugs was missing.

I figured I could wait them out. I lit several cigarettes indoors. A pregnant lady coughed, and I told her that secondhand smoke is a myth. Just then, a man in glasses made a break for it.

“Subway™ Eat Fresh and Freeze, Scumbag!®” I yelled.

Too late. He was already out the front door. I went after him.

“Stop right there!” I yelled as I ran. He was faster than me because I always try to avoid stepping on public sidewalks. Our country needs a private-sidewalk voucher system, but, thanks to the incestuous interplay between our corrupt federal government and the public-sidewalk lobby, it will never happen.

I was losing him. “Listen, I’ll pay you to stop!” I yelled. “What would you consider an appropriate price point for stopping? I’ll offer you a thirteenth of an ounce of gold and a gently worn ‘Bob Barr ‘08’ extra-large long-sleeved men’s T-shirt!”

He turned. In his hand was a revolver that the Constitution said he had every right to own. He fired at me and missed. I pulled my own gun, put a quarter in it, and fired back. The bullet lodged in a U.S.P.S. mailbox less than a foot from his head. I shot the mailbox again, on purpose.

“All right, all right!” the man yelled, throwing down his weapon. “I give up, cop! I confess: I took the bitcoins.”

“Why’d you do it?” I asked, as I slapped a pair of Oikos™ Greek Yogurt Presents Handcuffs® on the guy.

“Because I was afraid.”

“Afraid?”

“Afraid of an economic future free from the pernicious meddling of central bankers,” he said. “I’m a central banker.”

I wanted to coldcock the guy. Years ago, a central banker killed my partner. Instead, I shook my head.

“Let this be a message to all your central-banker friends out on the street,” I said. “No matter how many bitcoins you steal, you’ll never take away the dream of an open society based on the principles of personal and economic freedom.”

He nodded, because he knew I was right. Then he swiped his credit card to pay me for arresting him.

I don’t think I’m going out on a limb by saying that air travel can be stressful. Crowded flights rarely bring out the best in people, and that’s why common courtesy is so important. If you’ve ever been on a plane where a parent blatantly disregards that courtesy and lets her little black kid cry his lungs out in the seat next to you, then you’ve probably been pretty aggravated, much as I was on a recent flight to Atlanta. And yet somehow—don’t ask me how—for some reason I’ve come out of this whole episode as the bad guy. Yes, me. You know, as if that makes any sense at all.


Why? Oh, because apparently slapping a little nigger baby and telling him to shut up makes you some kind of monster in this day and age. Go figure.


Seriously, though, explain to me how I come out of this one looking like “the villain.” What was I doing wrong? Sitting in my seat, drinking my alcohol, and minding my own business? I acted like a normal human being, and now I’m being vilified. Look, I have all the sympathy in the world for parents traveling with young children. I know it’s no picnic. But if you can’t get your child to behave, then I’m sorry, steps need to be taken. I mean, am I missing something here?


And man, you wouldn’t believe the looks I got after I hit that nigger kid. Seriously, they were looking at me like I just totally lost my shit. Like I’d been the one crying, ruining the flight for everyone! No joke, these people turned on me so quick. On me! The good guy in this situation! It was one of the most bizarre things I’ve ever seen in my life: An airplane full of people looked at a screaming colored kid, and then looked at me—the guy who hit the kid, mind you—and they all decide to side with the colored kid. I couldn’t believe my fucking eyes.


Are you telling me if you were sitting next to this screeching little tar baby, you wouldn’t slap him? Or at least call him a nigger and just tell him to shut up? Well, if you have that kind of restraint, then way to go, Mother Teresa! Good for you. But I think the rest of us mortals would have done exactly the same thing. And again, what exactly was wrong about what I did? That’s right, nothing! I was doing the right thing! I was making the flight better for everyone!


In fact, why am I even explaining myself here? The nigger kid was and is the bad guy! Has everyone gone crazy or something?


And, look, obviously that cunt flight attendant had it out for me from the beginning, so I can see how she might have turned a few of the passengers against me, especially the other niggers. Still, you would think a few of the non-nigger and non-cunt passengers on board would have come to their senses and defended me. Nope. Not one of them did. So now I got this negro kid bawling in one ear, a shrill cunt clucking in the other, and 60 people looking at me like I’m Attila the Hun. I know, right? It makes no sense.


I lost my job over this, you know. I got fired. Until a few days ago, I was president of AGC’s Unitech Composites and Structures unit. Over 20 years of expert stewardship. But, oh, slap a nigger baby and suddenly two decades of loyalty and professionalism go up in smoke. Now I’m collecting welfare like a fucking spic. Can you even begin to wrap your mind around how retarded that is?


The thing that really kills me, though, is how unnecessary all this attention was. This whole thing wouldn’t have gotten so out of hand if the goddamned Jew-controlled media hadn’t slipped it into their 24-hour news cycle, the little faggots. That’s right, the greedy Jewish media vultures just swooped in and made sure that I looked like some kind of monster. Me: a decent, normal guy on his fifth bourbon, trying to enjoy his flight.


Well, now it’s all over and my life is ruined. I hope you’re all happy, folks, because the real tragedy of this whole unfortunate episode is that it couldn’t have happened to a nicer guy.

It's something before the age of HD internet porn. You would call, some sexy sounding lady would  have answered telling you what a little hot Pikachu she is. Fapping for 3 minutes would had occured and after that about 5 minutes of thinking 'what the hell am I doing with my life'.

TL;DR: call, fap, regret. Repeat.

You show me a machine or a computer program that can match the stellar majesty of Luciano Pavarotti’s singing “Nessun Dorma,” and I’ll acknowledge it as music. Until then, it’s fucking garbage.
If you’re under 25 years old — or an immature 30-plus — I’m about to set your ass straight.
So, listen up.
Your music is fucking garbage.
There, I said it.
Mindless crap. Eardrum-bursting, dagger-in-the-eyes, ass-bagging, blow your fucking brains out — unadulterated dog shit. That pretty much sums up the type of music that’s popular with today’s young people. Listen, you stupid sons of bitches. I’m talking at you. I’m your elder. My opinion demands respect. Your music hasn’t got life. It’s fucking dead. Your music is void of humanity. It’s as fake as a porn queen’s orgasm. There’s no soul. It’s tripe. It’s a carp in the sea of music. The stuff you listen to was created by fucking machines. Today’s “artists” — there’s an oxymoron — don’t even need to know how to play musical instruments or sing. In other words, no fucking talent whatsoever is needed to succeed today in music. You heard me. No. Talent. Whatsoever.
And, I’m fucking sick of it because the current generation is taking the gold we gave you and dragging it into a sewer. Listen up, you little pricks. I’m not stuck in some kind of classic rock time warp. Fact is, I expose myself to many different kinds of music. I give all music a chance. Even the techno-trash littering the modern music scene is something I’ve tried to digest, which I found to be like choking down a plate of raw oysters laced with salmonella. It would be nice to enjoy fresh musical acts. I want to hear new songs. I like some young people, especially when they get my order right. But real music is written and performed by humans, not a fucking computer program linked up to a laser show. Fact: The more fancy gadgets and distractions you need, the most your music just flat out sucks.
Music should convey some sense of humanity — who we are, and what we feel. I know that’s a hard concept to digest since your idea of a relationship is picking up a new Twitter follower. Where’s the love and romance in the mind-numbing rubbish that’s played at most nightclubs? Is there any conveyance pain and loss? Or pride and joy? How about playing a catchy tune that’s just fun to sing along with? Is that too much to fucking ask?
I don’t expect to like everything that’s new. As an amateur observer of the human condition, I freely acknowledge that successive generations are obliged to a continuation of the species which sometimes entails pushing boundaries and violating the preferences of their elders. History shows the more radically different one generation is from one to the next, the greater degree of innovations are sparked from such permutations. Music is just one by-product of inevitable cultural and technological shifts, sometimes mislabeled as advances.
Yes, yes, yes! New music should piss off plenty of parents and leathery jokers like me. At least I’ll accept “cultural evolution” as being inevitable, and necessary.
If you don’t believe this, take a look at the past century. Nearly a hundred years ago, traditional musicians hated a new sound called jazz. Later, jazz loyalists despised rock n’ roll and even the early sound of Motown. After that, the rockers hated disco music. Then, just about everyone hated New Wave and the 1980’s. Next came rap music which irritated everyone over the age of 30. Now, it’s hip hop and something called dubstep, which is essentially music made by computers and sound-making software. This garbage makes rap sound like fucking Amadeus.
There’s a reason this “music” is used as a weapon on suspected terrorists, forcing them to wear earphones and being bombarded with such abuse for hours. I’m not making this up. This is the brain-frying shit they put on the headphones and strap to the ears of prisoners who are handcuffed behind their backs and sit naked in jail cells while they are forced to endure this madness. I’d rather blow my fucking brains out, and if I ever did managed to get out, I’d be running off to join the nearest terrorist cell in order to extract my revenge.
Have a listen this rubbish if you can stand it for more than a few seconds
I know what you’re thinking. You want to go after my music. You want to blast away at me. Go ahead, fuckers. See if you can top what I like at the conclusion of this article. You’re drawing so fucking dead you should even be in my game.
So, what constitutes real music? Here’s a list of things I believe to be essential.
REAL MUSIC DEFINED BY [redacted]:
(1) Real music is created by humans, not by a machine or a computer.
(2) Real music has structure and consistency.
(3) Real music elicits real emotions — of love, loss, anger, fear, happiness, hope, inspiration, or anything related to the gambit of being human.
(4) Real music requires talent.
(5) Real music requires instruments and/or voices.
(6) Real music should be cross generational.
(7) Real music shouldn’t need gadgets or special effects to be enjoyed.
Here and now, I’ll leave you with a video clip of real music (CLICK BELOW). When one of those fucking machines creates a sound that can somehow match this magical majesty, then give me a call. Until then, don’t label what you listen to as “music.”
It’s not music. It’s garbage.

That's me. Elmore Zuckerman Karma. Last week I was walking to work, when suddenly a cloud of smoke appeared all rolled out in the street. I walked through it, because it was in my way, but when I went inside, it was a room with a single TV. On the TV, was beloved president Bill Clinton, current president and husband of former president Hillary Clinton. Fox news was on the TV. Making a report comparing the current president to the great German leader and peacekeeper, Uncle Adolf. Also in the room was a genie. I had met him last week so I couldn't get my wishes, but still he wanted to show me something. He pulled out his IPhone, the great product designed by IBM, and showed me a video of some person typing on a screen. 

"That's me, Elmore Zuckerman Karma" I read. I stopped reading. It was such bad writing. Confused. Suddenly God walked in, kissed me on the cheek, and gave me a blank check signed by Bill Gates. Then I woke up. 

When I went to the bathroom, I quickly forgot my dream, but then on the counter. I saw a blank check signed by Bill Gates.

IQ and understanding of quantum mechanics is completely different. IQ does not measure knowledge, but the ability to obtain and use knowledge.

The fans are not all brain whizzes. In fact from my life experience it is quite contrary. My dumbest friend who can't pass highschool math or English loves the show, whole other friends who are studying physics as I do and I would say are very smart do not watch the show. I'm not saying dumb people watch Rick in North, but rather not all Smart people watch the show and all people watching are not smart.

You can not say someone is smart based on the show they watched. No matter the show. It can be a lecture on gravitational waves by Steven Hawkings and the person watching can be dumb. I don't watch Rick and Morty. Not because I have other shows I like and prefer not to watch T.V.

Also to say "As a consequence people who dislike Rick & Morty truly ARE idiots" shows you are of a lower intelligence. To pass judgement on those who do not have similar interest is one of the qualities of someone with low intellect.















$------------------$















To be fair, you have to have a very high IQ to understand supply side economics. The policy is extremely subtle, and without a solid grasp on conservatism most of the ideas will go over the typical representative's head. There is also Paul Ryan's nihilistic outlook, which is deftly woven into his healthcare bills- his personal philosophy draws heavily from Ayn Rand literature, for instance. The supporters understand this stuff; they have the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate the depths of these policies, to realize they're not just bad - they do something dangerous to LIFE.. As a consequence people who dislike Ryan & McConnell truly ARE idiots- of course they wouldn’t appreciate, for instance, the humor in Ryan's existential catchphrase “I am deeply concerned,” which itself is a cryptic reference to Orwell’s British epic 1984. I’m smirking right now just imagining one of those addlepated simpletons scratching their heads in confusion as the GOP’s genius wit unfolds itself on their healthcare system. What fools.. how I pity them. 😂  

And yes, by the way, i DO know how to dab. And no, you cannot see. It’s for the ladies’ eyes only- and even then they have to demonstrate that they’re within 5 CBO points of my own (preferably lower) beforehand. Nothin personnel kid 😎

Anyone else find this scene really hot? When this alien farts at Jar Jar? The alien just looks so feminine and sexy, and the way it farts and turns to him to flaunt it. Like it's inviting him to get closer for the next one.

I first watched this movie when I was very young and I have masturbated to this scene so many times.﻿

I have to confess: lately I’ve been rather disappointed in myself.  I just havn’t had the same peppy spring in my step.  I feel like there’s something weighing me down but im just not sure what?  I want to go back to being the firm, shapely way I used to be.  I miss it: that feeling of pain tinged relief.  Hearing that single, satisfying splash always put a smile on my face.  Now I have to flex and strain myself, only to hear a “plop” in return for my efforts.  I dearly miss that noise, I had become so familiar I sprung up when I didn’t hear it.  I turned and looked down, spotting to small offender.  Twas like receiving a golden nugget instead of a solid bar.  I sat back down and hoped the next contender would bring me the familiar tingle and noise of success.  However, I was disappointed to hear several more “plops” in quick succession.  I yearned to hear that familiar, comforting noise.  I am no rabbit, I’m a man and I want it to look manly; as if it had from the very bowels of the most testosterone fueled lumberjack the world had ever seen.   It has been several weeks from that day and I have yet to produce my familiar golden brick.  I miss those eye-wateringly painful moment just before the blissful splash.  I want to see to see that red spot of success on my wiping tissue.  My golden brick has been a trademark of mine beyond even my own memory.  My mother regaled the tale of how, within the first few years of my life, I had left one of my trademark golden bars in my Grandmother’s receptacle where it was later happened upon by my Grandfather.  He was so impressed with the girth in relation to my small frame he could not believe my small frame had produced it.  He found it more plausible that someone had broken-in and left the bar as a gift than the truth.  Twas not until my Mother verified its origin that he realized the truth and even then he was flabbergasted.  In fact, I just showed my Mother this very writing, to which she replied: “that’s all true, can’t make it up”.

What did thou just speaketh foul of me, thou little wench?

no, we the religious conservatives have decided you will live out a lifetime of horrific agony. We will now forget you exist while we go prevent teenagers from getting free , accessible birth control and also dispelling the absurd fairytale known as evolution, and then post on facebook about how it isn't the right time to discuss gun legislatute because its too soon since a huge mass shooting occured with yet another legally purchased weapon. Cars can kill people too,  should we ban all cars as well? this is my philosophical trump card. nobody ever recovers enough to continue a debate after i play that line. they usually walk away mumbling about how it is impossible to reason with someone whos beliefs are cast in concrete and rebar, i was never , ever going to change my mind because the church decides for me where the edges of morality lay, and my only goal is to defend my ideals and my rights with patriotic displays which communicate nothing except a comforting sense of conformity through simple symbolism.

Anime is my passion. From childhood, this thing thrilled me. From crazy action scenes to beautiful women (not the ones in ecchi or hentai- they are disgusting), and I sort of want to delve deeper into this otaku lifestyle.

But I feel so isolated, so alone. While normal people do normal things, I feel like an outcast. So, in order to find acceptance, I gathered some buddies and did many fun things. Not particularly anime, but other stuff nerds love.

I loved my nerd life, but there was one thing missing... a girlfriend. For most of my life, I believed that nerds can't get a girl. However, times are changing and I could see more and more nerd girls who are very hot. Some love anime more than I do, and I want to dig into this shit. Delve deeper. And I need a soul mate who can come with me...

You know, I can give up this nerd life and be some Tom, Dick, and Harry. But that crap ain't fun, and I ain't gonna sacrifice being a nerd to be into some mainstream crap. I want to do what I'm passionate about and be accepted (Of course, I may make sacrifices to people I care, but not to the extent of being a boring person).

But how do I start this? Believe it or not, I never dated a single girlfriend in my entire life! I was busy surviving the hardships of life until now. I am ready, but how do I begin the process of dating in general, and how do I carry this to otaku lifestyle?

Pour être honnête, il faut avoir un QI très élevé pour comprendre Jean-Luc Mélenchon. Son humour est extrêmement subtil, et sans une compréhension avancée de la politique, la plupart de ses blagues passeront au-dessus de la tête du téléspectateur lambda. Il y a aussi la perspective marxiste de Jean-Luc qui est habilement intégrée dans ses discours - sa philosophie personnelle s'inspire fortement des écrits de Chantal Mouffe, par exemple. Les partisans comprennent ce genre de choses; ils ont la capacité intellectuelle de vraiment apprécier la profondeur de ses idées, de réaliser qu'elles ne sont pas seulement politiques - elles disent quelque chose de profond à propos de la VIE. En conséquence, les gens qui n'aiment pas la France Insoumise sont vraiment des idiots - bien sûr, ils n'apprécieraient pas, par exemple, l'humour dans le slogan existentiel du parti «Can't Stenchon the Mélenchon», qui est lui-même le témoignage cryptique d'une idéologie opposée au communautarisme. Je suis en train de ricaner en ce moment, imaginez un de ces simplets pourris gâtés qui se grattent la tête dans la confusion alors que le génie de Mélenchon prend place sur leurs écrans de télévision. Quels imbéciles... comme je les plains. 

Et d'ailleurs, oui j'ai un tatouage France Insoumise. Et non, vous ne pouvez pas le voir. C'est pour les yeux des dames seulement - Et même elles doivent d'abord démontrer qu'elles sont dans les 5 points de QI de différence avec le mien (de préférence inférieurs).

Really? Reddit is far more right-wing. Those stupid "Did you just assume my gender?" and "Triggered" memes originated on Reddit. There's a lot of misogyny and transphobia on this website, too, with "There are only two genders" being the most common opinion on gender issues throughout Reddit. Reddit is so right-wing that "special snowflake" is a buzzword on this site. Someone even used that shitty buzzword in this very thread! Redditors are so right-wing that they're more easily triggered than the SJW Tumblrinas they won't stop whining about. (I'm not defending Tumblr, either. Both Reddit and Tumblr are cancerous cesspools of shit.) Reddit is far, FAR more edge-lordy and right-wing from what I've seen.
Seriously, dude, look around you. Reddit has become a big neckbeard circle-jerk of white male anti-SJW edge lords shouting "Triggered!" ironically and making tired Rick and Morty references.

Sorry for wall.
I've been meaning to complain about this for a long time, it is in a general sense, lying. For eons man has been struggling to articulate himself in a way best suited to the recipient, however, through no fault of his own the medium of his articulation is always time consuming (see hieroglyphs) or a method that is very consuming of area (see modern alphabets). So when someone does say "Sorry for the wall of text", it engages a part of your mind that you're often unaware of. It engages the part of your mind that processes expectation, and when you are met with not a wall, and more of a small bump, you are let down. Because of this, people are disappointed by the lack of a wall and feel exposed and weak. Some people are able to brush off the betrayal they have felt, while others are more likely to process the emotion in a negative way, and feel minor annoyance instead of the satisfaction they long for.
Another reason they may feel annoyed by the lack of the aforementioned "wall" is because the writer seems pretentious. They feel that what they're saying is so important, no matter the size of the text it is to be considered a wall of monumental proportions, a wall so vast that they must apologise for its very existence. A wall that many, if not all, dare not to attempt, for it is large, and it is mighty. Men from all across the land queue up, their crampons and ropes in hand, but although they may try to tackle this great obelisk of text, naught succeed. A wall of himalayan stature that is populated only by goats and eagles, leopards and monkeys, beasts of the alpine. A wall that will forever alter the way us mortal men, unable to produce a wall of such epic proportions, perceive reality, knowing that they are cursed never to replicate such a magisterial sight of a wall of text. But none of that would happen, for they have written a pitiful, hopeless mound of steaming manure. Populated with poor word choice, and littered with arbitrary commas and terrible sentence structure. For they are unable to build a wall that will stand the test of time, and they merely want to build a wall for the SAKE of building it.
The final nail in the coffin of these "builders of walls" is their own hubris. I can attest to the fact that by hurriedly scribbling out whatever comes into your mind in an attempt to build such a wall will result in strained fingers and a very quick realisation that you have nothing to say, so what you must do in this situation is continue your usage of dry words, because I swear to all that is holy if anyone has even bothered to read this far into my reply I will be thoroughly annoyed. The only purpose of this was to create a legiblbe wall of text for irony's sake, and not for the reader to actually acknowledge this wall's content. Because if I am to be entirely candid, the contents of this wall are utter rubbish, I have gone out of context so far I don't even remember what I started this with. I was going to write "Sorry for wall of text-- TLDR; Sorry for wall of text" and that would be it, but for some unholy reason I decided "Hey, let's see how far I can go without saying anything of value" and I think we can all agree I have gone far too far past the joke for this to be even remotely considered funny. If anything me taking 20 minutes out of my day to write a currently three thousand character reply to a comment for the sake of nothing but irony is quite possibly the saddest thing I've ever done, with the exception of my one thousand word Dat Boi essay, yes that's a real thing, and yes I have written over a dozen essays on memes, dat boi is just the biggest example of me wasting time. It probably is my best essay though, if I'm being candid once more. I recently started to get burned out when writing things, i think that's more to do with my personal life though, and again if I'm 100% honest with you I think this comment reply has become almost a diary entry to me, and if you want to get any more personal with me you're gonna have to put a ring on my finger. So I think a four thousand character wall is good enough for the sake of irony, and I bid you all good day.

Yeah, I think I know what’s going on here. She was practicing for a role in Grown Ups 3. She would’ve gotten it too, with her masterful and well thought out method acting of the over attached, sometimes literally, child; but, just she was about audition, Adam Sandler himself appeared testing children for the role of Bean’s sister in a reprisal of the “got to grow up” motif that was evident in his character arch as well as the first Grown Ups in general. 

To test how she’d take to the transition between her mother’s breast milk in the movie and regular dairy milk, Sandler put her through the scene in which she was forced she the changing of things, the onward marching of time, and her overall development as a functional human being by making the utterly and importantly symbolic switch from the breast pump to the milk carton. 

When she had done so, this stellar method actress of four years’ instincts sprang into immediate action; she forced herself to drop breast milk cold turkey without even informing the rest of the Grown Ups 3 crew to her performance, acting as though she had reached a true epiphany and refusing to take breast milk, even as another act.

Unable to take advantage of the four year olds artistry in this form, seeing as the audition had not been taped for budgetary reasons, she was kicked off the cast in favor of another child acting prodigy who was willing to sell out and be controlled by the man. What’s more, the incident got her blacklisted from all of Hollywood. “She’ll never work in this town again!” The director, who was also Adam Sandler, was once heard shouting. “Never!”

Having been fired and thrown away by all of tensiltown, the four year old began to lead a more normal life where our OP found her a year later.

Informative, you will give you an IQ heart to understand more about Rick Moretti. Very tasty, without the ability to understand the comprehension of physics, many of the gamblers go on the watch model. There is also fantasy, because it is put in its wisdom and nature - the philosophy itself is the book 'Narodnja Valya', for example. Runners understand these things. They have the ability to understand the deep water of this gossip, realizing that they do not comment on the life of Amadg. As a result, people falsely claim to get the correct Odats- we are not thankful for the example, the layout of humor is an existential "Libyan Luba tuk tuk", which itself is a sign of- invisible Turgenev Russian epic father and child. I'm Smarckang now thinking that one of the Odlipatd people is shaking their heads as a scholar at Dan Harmon appeared on their television table. What is ... how to feel sorry. 😂

And, by the way, I do not have to be tattooed on Rick Moretti. No, you will not find it. This is in the eyes of women, and then they have to show that they are leaving EQ 5 (less less) before they arrive. Children's children.

It's like that perfect moment in your favorite story when we learn an entirely new aspect of our protagonist's backstory that's been kept under wraps, and you just know this new nugget of information will come in handy when the protagonist next faces a challenge. And when it eventually happens that way, the first thing you realize is how well this has all been written.
Dunkey's given us a look into the machinations of how he became Dunkey, but not just because he wants to. He does it because it's directly relevant to what he's about to bring up next, and because it gives us insight into why he looks for and reacts to specific things in videogames.
Just like how our protagonist's new and relevant backstory gives us a new perspective of the immediate arc and of everything in the past, we get a new perspective on both Cuphead and Dunkey.

To be fair, you have to have a very high IQ to main Doomfist. The abilities are extremely difficult to master, and without a strong gamesense and years of practice most of his abilities will go not be used effectively by the typical playes. There’s also Doomfist’s liking of combat, which is deftly woven into his characterisation- his personal philosophy draws heavily from the story “The Tortoise and The Haire”, for instance. The fans main this hero; they have the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate the timing and precision in his abilities, to realise that they’re abilities in Overwatch- they say something deep about LIFE. As a consequence people who dislike Doomfist truly ARE idiots- of course they wouldn’t appreciate, for instance, the humour in Doomfist’s existential catchphrase “Meteor Strike” which itself is a cryptic reference to the asteroid impact 75 million years ago that wiped out the dinosaurs, just like he wipes out his enemies. I’m smirking right now just imagining one of those addlepated simpletons scratching their heads in confusion as Jeff Kaplan’s genius wit unfolds itself on their Monitors. What fools.. how I pity them. 😂

And yes, by the way, i DO have a Doomfist tattoo. And no, you cannot see it. It’s for the ladies’ eyes only- and even then they have to demonstrate that they’re within 5 IQ points of my own (preferably lower) beforehand. Nothin personnel kid 😎

We already have the lack of normal human races like Mexicans and Germans, and now bethesda is taking it even further? I've had Nord NPCs call my Redguard character "milk drinker" multiple times, which obviously an offensive racial slur. Oh yeah, and let's not forget how my Argonian keeps on getting called a "Lizard" and my Khajiit a "Cat".

I hope Bethesda stops this racism in their games, because if this continues, I might not ever buy a product of their's ever again. The strong racism in this game is already making me regret buying it new and not used...

Stfu you piece of greasy ass mayonnaise licking off the spoon egg head shaped bitch, it's offensive as fuck and rude. It has meaning. Us white ppl are the most privileged and you should use that to your advantage to help every race. Not tackle them down you ignorant pos. IT'S NOT YOUR WORD TO SAY. They earned it and it's theirs. Black ppl can't be privileged. Educate yourself you beavis and butthead look-alike. You look like you end an argument with n-gg-r because you've ran out of insults to use. Bet the letters are faded out in ya keyboard and your phone automatically predicts it after you type "ni" You dusty looking cunt, go back to hunting deer by the creek and listening to your BVB

MOTHERFUCKING SHIT. I WAS JUST MASTURBATING AND EVERYTHING WAS GOING GREAT. I WAS IN MY ROOM, I HAD MY HEADPHONES ON, I WAS TOTALLY NAKED SITTING AT MY COMPUTER FAPPING AWAY TO A VIDEO ON REDTUBE. ALL OF A SUDDEN THERE'S THIS REALLY SHARP PAIN IN MY DICK, LIKE IT JUST GOT STABBED WITH A SEWING NEEDLE. I JERKED MY HAND BACK AND IT BUMPED INTO MY COMPUTER TOWER, WHICH SITS ON THE DESK. WELL, I HAD MY STICK OF DEODORANT ON TOP OF THE TOWER, AND THAT BITCH FELL OFF AND LANDED DEODORANT-END-DOWN ON THE HEAD OF MY COCK. HOLY FUCKING SHIT DID THAT HURT, AND ON TOP OF THAT IT HIT SO HARD THAT IT ACTUALLY FORCED SOME DEODORANT INTO MY URETHRA. I'VE NEVER HAD ANYTHING BURN SO BAD IN MY ENTIRE LIFE. I JUMPED OUT OF MY FUCKING CHAIR AND STOOD UP BECAUSE IT HURT SO BAD; THIS CAUSED MY HEADPHONE CABLE TO GET YANKED OUT OF MY SPEAKERS, WHICH CAUSED "OH YEAH BABY COME DEEP IN MY TIGHT TEEN ASSHOLE UH UH UH" TO GET BLARED THROUGH MY FUCKING HOUSE AND ALMOST MAXIMUM VOLUME. NOW MY EYES ARE WATERING FROM THE PAIN OF THE DEODORANT INSIDE MY COCK BUT I MANAGE TO PUNCH ONE OF MY SPEAKERS HARD ENOUGH SO THEY TURN OFF. I LOOKED DOWN AND NOTICED BLOOD DRIPPING OFF OF MY COCK; I GUESS THE LIP OF THE PLASTIC DEODORANT THING BIT INTO MY FORESKIN AS IT CONNECTED WITH MY COCK. THE BLOOD WAS DRIPPING DOWN MY LEG.

THIS ALL HAPPENED IN THE SPACE OF MAYBE 6 SECONDS. IT MAY SEEM BAD BUT IT GETS WORSE. JUST AS I'M STANDING THERE TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHAT THE FUCK HAPPENED, MY BEDROOM DOOR FUCKING OPENS. MY DAD WAS STANDING THERE WITH MY ACCEPTANCE LETTER TO JOHNS HOPKINS. I FROZE AND HE STARED AT ME, NAKED WITH MY BLOODY ERECTION FOR MAYBE 15 SECONDS BEFORE HE NOTICED MY COMPUTER MONITOR AND THE BRUTAL ANAL SEX SCENE GOING ON FULL-SCREEN. HE IMMEDIATELY CLOSED THE DOOR AND LEFT WITHOUT SAYING ANYTHING. THIS MAY SEEM EMBARRASSING BUT MY DAD IS A SERIOUSLY CONSERVATIVE CHRISTIAN. THIS HAPPENED ABOUT 15 MINUTES AGO AND HE HASN'T SAID ANYTHING TO ME YET. I'M STILL IN MY ROOM TRYING TO GET THE GOD DAMN FUCKING OLD SPICE OUT OF MY COCK. WHAT SHOULD I DO /b/?

Don't say God's name in vain. It adds nothing to the discussion. And because it adds nothing to the discussion, I am justified in downvoting you. (See Redditquette on how downvotes should be applied for further clarification)

So let this be a lesson to you. You aren't being cool or edgy by saying God's name in vain. You are just being an asshole.

And then he looked at his desktop image, and saw Sonic’s bleeding eyes staring at him, and he knew: he was in a unforged spookypasta.

He fled from his room to the bathroom, but found that the toilet had been replaced by a stack of photos of Slenderman, soaked in remaining toiletwater. He went down the stairs to see his family, but they had no faces and were facing him. Facelessly. 

Losing face, he went outside, or would have, had there been an outside. For the door outside lead to the inside of his room, where ModOrganiser was up on the screen.

He clicked Run for SKSE, and everything became white.

Until he saw the brown and red of dirt, wood, and blood.

“WHAT IN OBLIVION IS THAT?”

“ARCHERS!”

“DRAGON!”

The executioner’s axe missed him by a hair, and the dragon, Alduin, stared the extradimensional human in the face.

Who ran.

He perished, like many that day on the 17th of Last Seed, but as his soul got filtered through the Dreamsleeve, a part of him knew that this comment is very silly and his reality would end upon the final sentence of this comment unless someone else continued the story.

Ryuuko Matoi was one day walking the streets of Tokyo feeling sad. Her best friend and favorite clothes, Senketsu, had died. All of the sudden Life Fibers began attacking, so Ryuuko took out her scissor sword to attack them but they were too strong like steel. They were like robots too Suddenly a black and red hedgehog instantly appeared, as if he stopped time and warped there and kicked the life fiber robot and destroyed it.

"Who are you?", asked Ryuuko.

"I am Shadow the Hedgehog, the Ultimate Life Form"

"What was that thing?"

"I was about to ask you the same question kid" replied Shadow.

"Hey, who are you calling a kid? Do you want to fight?" Ryuuko got mad.

"Challenge accepted, you're no match for me" said Shadow.

Battle BGM: I Am All of Me

Ryuuko and Shadow then fought. Shadow was able to block Ryuuko's sword slashes and got a lot of homing attacks on Ryuuko. Then Ryuuko caught Shadow and threw him but he landed. Shadow then used Chaos Control and almost froze Ryuuko but Ryuuko's sword was even faster and was 0.000000000001 cm away from Shadow's neck when he used Chaos Control.

"Youre pretty good, human. Hmph"

"So r u. hmph" Ryuuko said.

"Those are life fibers, they make whoever puts them on super strong but they can also be used for evil. My mom Ragyou almost took over the world with them"

"And those robots were made by Doctor Eggman. He puts animals inside them and tries to take over the world with the chaos emeralds"

"How could Ragyou be back? They must be teaming up. I think we should too. Right, ultimate life form?" said Ryuuko. Ryuuko was being sarcastic.

"Sure, but don't hold me back" said Shadow.

BGM: Blumenkranz

Meanwhile at Doctor Eggman's lab.

"Ohohohoho. These Life Fibers make my Badniks stronger and tougher. And my clothes look very fancy too! All because my egg pawns found this very beautiful lady"

Eggman looked up and he saw Ragyou who was back but she looked different. Half of her body was metal now so she is METAL RAGYOU.

"I should be thanking you Dr. Eggman for bringing me back to life and for giving me new metal powers and reviving the life fibers" said Ragyou. She was drinking tea.

"Thats because I got a chaos emerald and used its power to fix you. If we find six more we can take over the world with robots AND life fibers"

"Yes. Nobody will escape" said Ragyou.

Dr. Eggman tried giving Ragyou a rose but she slapped it out of his hands.

"No that is gross. I am a lesbian and an incest pedophile"

BGM: Sonic Adventure 2 OST - Event: Strategy

Ryuuko and Shadow went to GUN to go get weapons and they saw Commander Tower.

"G.U.N Commander Tower give us some weapons" said Shadow

"No way, Shadow. Only if you are going to save the world"

"WE are", said Ryuuko

"OK" and Commander Tower gave some weapons.

There were guns and swords and motorcycles but not enough people to hold them.

"We need an army", said Shadow

"I know where to find one", said Ryuuko and they rode theyre motorcycles to Honnouji Academy.

BGM: Tony Harnell's It Doesn't Matter

"Satsuki we need your help!" said Ryuuko.

"I'm busy" Satsuki said. She was busy chasing a certain blue hedgehog.

Sonic and Satsuki were having a battle. Satsuki used her two swords to try and cut him. Sonic did a spin dash and got out of the way, but they grazed each other.

"Hey you're pretty good. Shadow! Whose youre friend Im Sonic Sonic the Hedgehog!"

"Ryuuko Matoi and looks like you met my sister Satsuki Kiryuin"

"Sonic, quit goofing off. Doctor Eggman has teamed up with this Ragyou lady and they want to take over the world"

"Dont sweat it Shadow then we gotta team up too!"

Then the Four Devas of Honnouji Academy came and said,

"Lady Satsuki we will help you and Ryuuko defeat your mom again!"

And then Mako came in and there was a hallelujah with her theme song and a light and she said

"this is so cool i didnt know ryuuko made new friends if your friends with new friends I can be a friend too and their friends are ryuukos friends and my friends to everyone is everyones friend!"

Then the Nudist Beach soldiers came with Mikisugi and Tsumugu.

"If the life fibers are back we need to strip them because we are nudists", said Mikisugi and his nipples and weewee sparkled.

Sonic said, "We should invite more friends to this party!"

Then in the Tornado, Tails, Knuckles, and all of Sonic and Shadow's friends came and there was a tea party.

"Not bad. Everyone take some weapons", said Ryuuko and then everyone got powered up with guns and swords and even Amy.

BGM: Kiryuu G Kill

Suddenly, Satsuki's butler Soroi came in and told everyone.

"Milady everyones Ultima Uniforms came back and they are fixed like new!"

Shadow told Ryuuko

"Because your mom has been using the Chaos Emeralds to perform Chaos Control all your uniforms must have came back"

"No way" Ryuuko said.

"Wait. This means I can find my Godrobe Senketsu and we can use the emeralds to bring him back" said Ryuuko.

"Let's go find those Emeralds"

Satsuki got on top of her podium and bright light shone becasuse she is Satsuki.

"All students attention! You have new mission to find the chaos emeralds and fix Senketsu"

Tails flew up and said, "with my radar we can track them down but we'll need to be fast and get them before Eggman does"

"You heard the fox, go out and find those emerlads all students move out. The school Boot Camping Trip will now begin!" shouted Satsuki as she put on Junketsu.

Everyone searched high and low in beach zones, fire zones, ice zones, city zones, water zones, and more until they found six emeralds. Eggman and Ragyou's robot life fibers stood in the way but they were too weak because they did not have guns AND Ultima Uniforms

"Where's that damn seventh Chaos Emerald" said Ryuuko

"Damn. Eggman must have it", said Shadow

BGM: KiLLL la KiLL Start at 1:00

Then Doctor Eggman sent in his Egg Fleet to attack Honnouji Academy.

"Muahahaha. Looking four this?!" Doctor Eggman held up the last emerald.

"You'll never beat me without the last emerald! Egg Fibers attack!"

Everyone took out their guns and shot the Egg Fibers with super starch bullets.

But suddenly the last emerald slipped out of Eggman's hands and flew straight to Ryuuko. And all the pieces of Senketsu came out of the Chaos Emeralds and he was fixed.

"Ryuuko I am so happy you found me. I hid my pieces in the Chaos Emeralds when I fell to earth. Now you can put me on and become super powered"

Then Ryuuko did Life Fiber Synchronization and Shadow said,

"Not bad".

"Who is the fuzzball? I hope he doesn't chew on me", laughed Senketsu, but Shadow didn't find the joke funny.

Ryuuko, Satsuki, Shadow, and Sonic then led the attack on the Egg Fleet. Knuckles and Gamagoori ripped open the doors. Tails in his mecha and Jakuzure blasted down the bad guys. Inumuta and Rouge did spying. Mako, Sanageyama, Blaze and Silver fought on the ship. Big the Cat and Mako's family made croquettes for everyone so noone was hungry because the battle took lots of days.

BGM: Paul Shortino's E.G.G.M.A.N

"Give it up Eggman" said Sonic.

"Dumb hedgehogs and high school girls. You are no match for my latest invention with help from Ragyou. Behold! The Egg Spindle"

It was a giant spinning wheel with life fiber spikes and machine guns and lazer blasters and spun really fast.

"Ryuuko I have an idea", said Senketsu

"Follow my lead", said Shadow

"No. Follow MY lead" said Ryuuko

Shadow and Ryuuko combined their Spin Dash and Senketsu Gale

Sonic and Satsuki combined their Spin Dash and Junketsu Whirlwind and a mega combo attack was made.

"SUPER SONIC WIND OVERLORD FURY SLASH!"

"Oh no! It's not supposed to spin THAT way!" and Doctor Eggman was defeated but where was Ragyou? She disappeared

BGM: Powerman 5000's Almost Dead

Then a giant comet appeared in the sky the Black Arms were back and Metal Ragyou was with Black Doom.

"Hahaha. Eggman you are fool. I tricked you. Life Fibers became friends with the Black Arms. We are now evil friends. With this new power I am no longer Metal Ragyou, now I am METAL DOOM RAGYOU" said Metal Doom Ragyou.

"Yes. And we also secretly used Eggman's machines to bring someone back to life" said Black Doom

Ragyou then used Chaos Control to open a portal.

"NO WAY! She learned CHAOS CONTROL?!"

BGM: Before My Body is Dry

The Biolizard crashed onto the battlefield with Black Doom. They were even stronger now with help from the life fibers so to beat them you need to go Super.

So Sonic and Shadow used the Chaos Emeralds to go Super and then Ryuuko and Satsuki used everyone's life fibers to turn Super as well. Now Satsuki unlocked Junketsu Fashion Week too!

BGM: Aoi Eir's Sirius

"Ryuuko. You and Shadow are the only ones who can beat Metal Ragyou. Sonic and I will defeat them. We will follow you when he is dead" said Satsuki.

"Yeah, and I know you can do it, Shadow" said Sonic.

"Thanks sis" replied Ryuuko

"They won't stand a chance", said Shadow.

"Let's go show them REAL teamwork", said Senketsu. Shadow removed his inhibitor rings and launched with Senketsu and they flew into space.

Ragyou fused the REVOCS satellite with the Black Comet and the Space Colony ARK. It became the Meteor Fiber Rebirth Zero.

"Hahaha if this crashes into the earth the life fibers will spread everywhere and take over forever! NO! How can it be?! Prepare to be destroyed fakers! Take this my Doom Omnisilk Koketsu's CHAOS ABSOLUTE DOMINATION CONTROL!"

The attack froze Ryuuko and Shadow in place.

"We can't move!" said Ryuuko.

"Even if you cannot be affected by my first form, with Chaos power your time will stop" and Ragyou did a lot of damage, but then Senketsu absorbed it and learned a new combo attack.

"Shadow, use a Chaos Spear!", shouted Senketsu

"And I'll combine it to make..."

"SENKETSU CHAOS BLADE TRIDENT STORM"

Senketsu Chaos Trident Edge attacks with Senketsu Blade Gale bonded with Chaos Spear to attack in past, present, and future. It will hit no matter what. Ragyou was speared everywhere by 9999 energy spears

"NOOOOO! THAT'S IMPOSSIBLE. I'M BEING DESTROYED IN ALL TIMES. I NEED MORE POWER!"

Ultimate Battle BGM: Crush 40's Live and Learn

Meanwhile Sonic and Satsuki defeated Black Doom and were about to beat Biolizard but he was Chaos Controlled away.

"Something's wrong, we gotta go help those two", said Satsuki so they flew into space and saw Metal Doom Ragyou carrying the

Ragyou then performed her ultimate fusion to use life fibers to sew together Eggman machines, all of the Black Arms, the ARK, and the Final Hazard. The boss text spelled out.

THE FIBER HAZARD

"I'LL COVER THE EARTH IN LIFE FIBERS NO MATTER WHAT. PAST PRESENT AND FUTURE WILL BE COVERED. YOU TWO FAKERS AND YOUR FRIENDS WILL NEVER BEAT ME EVER!"

Now Ryuuko and Shadow got really really really mad

"Don't. You. EVER. CALL. US. FAKERS!"

Senketsu shouted "Time to end it! Sonic! Satsuki! Let me absorb some Chaos power and share it with you guys. Let's show her what a real ultimate fusion looks like!"

With both Chaos power and Godrobes Sonic and Shadow went past Super and past Hyper to get a new level. The Godrobes gave them their own Ultima Uniforms to make HYPER ULTIMA SONIC and HYPER ULTIMA SHADOW.

Then the Chaos Emeralds became studded into Senketsu and Junketsu to become CHAOS SENKETSU HAUTE COUTURE and CHAOS JUNKETSU HAUTE COUTURE.

"HOW DO YOU LIKE THIS?" Ragyou Fiber Hazard split herself from the falling colony to drop it on the earth.

"We don't think so!" replied Sonic and Satsuki as they proceeded to destroy it with a Junketsu Blade Boost which makes their boost gauge unlimited as long as they have rings.

"YOU'LL NEVER WIN! NEVER NEVER NEVER!" Shouted Ragyou Fiber Hazard. She used her Koketsu spears like punches in DBZ but Ryuuko and Shadow dodged them and counterattacked.

"PREPARE TO DIE YOU CREEP!" yelled Shadow and Ryuuko.

Ryuuko unlocked her swords and they became energy for the attack

"REAPER MODE: SENKETSU CHAOS FIBER RIPPER BLAAAAAAAAST!"

Ultimate power annihilated Ragyou and her fibers across time and space so she can never regenerate in any place or time. The day had been saved.

BGM: Sonic Adventure 2 ending theme

The two hedgehogs and the two girls went back down to earth and they saved the world.

Everyone had tea and a picnic and it was also a welcome home party for Senketsu too! Shadow and his friends and Ryuuko and her friends all had a good time.

"I underestimated you, Ryuuko" said Shadow.

"Me too. Ultimate Life Form. We make a good team saving the world", said Ryuuko.

"As long as he doesn't get lint on me" said Senketsu. And they all laughed.

[20:58] Carlevin: 34 days, 5 4's

[20:58] Carlevin: Strip naked.

[21:04] Tori Riandra 's eyes grow wider as more fours roll onto the table pushing her closer to her fate. Nodding obediently to the woman's words Tori stood ready to remove the little protection she had. "Yes ma'am." Her voice echo'd out. Starting with the bring pink ears that sat atop her head she let the head wear fall to the floor, it's bells chiming throughout the room as it hit the ground. Bending over the next piece to come off was her thigh-high socks, her hands unrolling them down. The strands of rope that barely covered her small frame was tricky to remove, her hands having to slip through the multiple holes, the rope moving quickly uncovering her nipples and slit. With it finally loose, Tori allowed it to drift down, stepping out of the outfit. With only her arms and hands left with any warmth the girl briskly removes them, leaving her body bare. "Is this good?" Tori asked, her nipples growing hard against the cool air.

[21:09] Carlevin grins and grabs your shoulders, forcing you onto your knees. She growls and grins down at you as she picks up the dice again, ready to seal your fate further. She aims her dick against you, oozing a slow glob precum from her dick, already rock hard. "Nnnfff... I am going to love churning you into jizz and ending your existence as nothing more than a load of my gooey seed." She grins down at you, her cock pulsating in anticipation.

[21:09] System: Carlevin rolls 1d4+1d4: 1 + 1 = 2

[21:14] System: Carlevin rolls 1d4+1d4: 4 + 4 = 8

[21:14] Carlevin: that's 8 4's

[21:14] Tori Riandra sequels softly as she is thrust onto her knees, those bright yellow pearls being greeted by Carlevin's cock, the slow drop of precum filling her nose with it's scent. Being trapped below the woman Tori could only rely on the next few rolls of dice. 'Reroll 1' brought a wave of excitement to her, doing a mental cheer, only to be crushed by the next roll putting her dangerously close to her life ending. 'Reroll 2' came after. Tori's eyes filled with worry as she awaited the next roll.
[21:15] Tori Riandra: Perm'd~

[21:16] Carlevin grins widely down at her.... "And here I even gave you a second chance... but it still came up as permavore... looks like you're going to be nothing more than my cum forever." She growls deeply and grins, that rock hard prick pulsating visibly with every pulse of her hearts. "I can't wait to end your existencce... do you want one last fuck before I end you... or to just get devoured?" She teases, her hungry nuts gurgling loudly.

[21:19] Tori Riandra feels her stomach well up inside of her, her life would be over soon, churned up forever to be cum. "W-we couldn't roll once more?" Tori pleaded, knowing that it was simply off the table. Her eye falling down to rest on the pulsating cock infront of her, it staring her down, ready to consume her. Being underneath the woman Tori didn't have any chance of making a getaway either. "If you'd be so kind I wouldn't mind one last fuck."

[21:21] Carlevin grins, "Okay... one last roll... d20's opposed... win it and I give you one last fuck... lose... and I -really- destroy you, I make you feel your end."

[21:23] Tori Riandra gulps at the woman's offer, unsure to take it or not, destruction of her not sounding too pleasant. "What does destroy mean?"

[21:25] Carlevin growls deeply, "I'm going to crush you on the way down, dislocate arms... crush the air from your lungs.... just break you on the way down."

[21:28] Tori Riandra shivers at the thought, her fate seeming much better to her then the results of losing. "And if I win we fuck?"

[21:28] Tori Riandra: ((Sorry for the delay, was completing one last bit of homework, done it now.)

[21:30] Carlevin nods, "And I give you a regular, gentle churning into perma-nutsludge."

[21:30] Tori Riandra timidly reaches for the die, tossing it gently onto the table.

[21:30] System: Tori Riandra rolls 1d20: 7

[21:31] System: Carlevin rolls 1d20: 6

[21:35] System: Tori Riandra rolls 1d20: 6

[21:35] Carlevin: Looks like you get one last fuck... get on the bed, bend over the edge... I'm going to ruin your pussy." she teases, her cock still rock hard and dripping precum down onto the floor, her growls soft and eager.

[21:38] Tori Riandra breaths a sigh of relief, happy to not have her body destroyed. Heading to Carlevin's words she crawls over to the edge of the bed, her ass swaying with each step she took, her cunt in full view. Bending over the edge of the bed Tori gripped onto the sheets, waiting for the predator to stretch her wide.

[21:40] Carlevin puts her big forpaws on the bed above her shoulders, that huge cock pushing up against your folds, her body shaking with pleasure as she starts to push her huge cock into that tight tunnel. She shudders a bit, growling with pleasure. "Good girl... just stay relaxed... it might hurt a bit from the size.

[21:44] Tori Riandra grimaced as she felt the rod poke at her entrance, the tip stretching her close to her limit. Ger face pushing into the bed as she bit down on the sheet, trying to hold back any grunts or moans. The growling heard behind her was enough to make her listen to the words the woman spoke, she felt submissive to the woman. Nodding into the blanket Tori tried to relax her body, fingers uncurling, letting go of the sheet with her teeth. "Yes ma'am."

[21:45] Tori Riandra: ((Don't reply to that, I'll add more. That was a crappy reply D:))

[21:47] Tori Riandra: Cont. Tori spoke as she loosened her body, hips holding firm against Carlevin's thrust, the weight above her pushing her into the bed slightly pinning her down. Her body was free to be used as the woman saw fit. Panting as her cock pulsed, rubbing against her clit Tori found herself growing wet aiding in the penetration.

[21:57] Carlevin pushes deeper into that tight pussy, bulging it out lewdly with her thick cock, her rod pushing down deeper into the girl's tunnel. She snarls with lust and bucks forwards, the tightness making her cock throb eagerly. She keeps pumping deeper and deeper, seeming to want to try and force that huge knot into your pussy, her shaft easily two feet in length counting it. She shakes with pleasure, her heavy nuts slapping against the back of your thighs with each thrust.

[22:02] Tori Riandra feels her jaw drop, mouth wide as she gets filled out by the taur's cock, stretching her walls past their limits. Her lips clinging tightly around the rock hard cock, greedily trying to draw more into her. "It's..... So big." She managed to blurt out as Carlevin pushed deeper into her. Feeling the pure size begin to stretch not only her cunt but her body out was something Tori hadn't ever felt before, her eye's wide as well as her mouth, a long lewd moan exiting from her agape jaw. The pressure of her knot would soon be felt, pushing against the tight entrance forcing Tori into the bed more, crushing her into the mattress.

[22:06] Carlevin shudders, she's amazed that this much of her massive cock fits inside of that tight pussy. She shudders and groans out, her knot grinding against her pussy, groaning and growling with pleasure as she pushes and pumps against that tight snatch, rubbing and grinding the knot against her as though trying to push the grapefruit sized knot into her pussy. "nfff... I am not going to tie with you sweetie... just tease... if you get knotted I won't be able to slurp you down my dick.

[22:09] Tori Riandra mewled out as that knot ground against her slit, pushing up against her clit as her body began to shiver. Pleasure coursing throughout her body with each movement Carlevin made, moans coerced out of her. Biting her lip Tori grunted as she rocked back against the woman, grinding her greedy cunt against the massive cock inside her. Her tongue lolling out of her mouth as she started to lose herself to the pleasure, an orgasm on the edge of overtaking her body.

[22:17] Carlevin starts to gush hot jizz into that needy cunt, her nuts twitching as she keeps squirting and gushing, emptying that massive load of jizz into her pussy. She shakes and moans, her ears pinning back against her head as her nuts keep gushing and pumping huge waves of hot cum deep into her body. She shakes a bit and pulls back, squirting and dripping hot jizz over her thighs.

[22:23] Tori Riandra is quickly pushed over the edge as she feels her womb fill up with the thick warm seed, her body trembling as she spasms underneath the woman. Her body taken over by orgasm, mind filled with nothing but pleasure as her womb was filled with nothing but cum. "Oh god! It's too much!~" She purred out, complete Ecstasy rolling in waves throughout her. Suddenly she felt empty, her cunt gaping wide while her thighs were coated in cum, it sliding down them to the ground coating her entire legs. Slumping into the bed Tori lay there, her chest rising and falling trying to recover from the orgasm. "T-thank you!" She moaned out while rolling over onto her back, her yellow pearls gazing lovingly towards the Taur's own.

[22:33] Carlevin smiles down at her and slides back, pushing her cock against the girl's feet, starting to pull her into that hot tunnel the jizz slicking it and making a mess of her feet. The feline growls deeply, "did it feel good sweetie? It looks like there isn't much left of your mind after that fucking.... there's about to be even less too." She keeps squeezing and tugging around her feet, her body shivering with pleasure, ears pinned back, "Nnff... squirm for me a lot sweetie... I want to really enjoy you."

[22:37] Tori Riandra keeps still as her feet get pulled into the head of Carlevin's cock, her mind and body flush while she panted. Her chest rising and falling. The warmth around her feet bringing her back slightly, her head raising to look at her situation. "W-wait..." She managed to mumbled in her drunken state. Her fingers curling into the sheets ever so lightly, a futile attempt to stop the slow drag of her body. The scent of sex swirling around the two, hot cum mixing itself into the air teasing into Tori's nose. Wiggling her toes she felt them tease the inner walls of her member.

[22:47] Carlevin kneads over her breasts a she starts to push herself up deeper into that thick, jizz oozing hot cum over her calves as they get pulled down into that hungry cock. "For what sweetie... you lost the rolls... I gave you your last fucking... its time to surrender to your fate my dear." She kisses her neck and hair, her purr warm and gentle even as she's drawing the girl down her cock to her end as nothing more than cum.

[22:51] Tori Riandra begins to relax into the woman's grasp feeling her fear float away as the warmth spread to her calves, the tight grip on them aiding in her relaxation. "Y-yes Ma'am." She would reply meekly, her fate fully sealed. Wiggling her legs, hoping to tease the Taur more and more. The cock pulling her down to her fate, to be churned and turned into nothing but cum. "What will you do once I'm cum?" Tori asked curiously.

[22:55] Carlevin kneads over her belly and up over her breasts, groaning with pleasure, her ears pinning back against her head as she flexes her cock, suddenly slurping up to her hips, pushing them down into her pulsating shaft, her legs starting to push down into those hungry nuts, the feeling of warmth and tingling teasing and tickling against her feet, feeling strangely good unlike what it must feel like to be inside off a stomach and being digested

[22:58] Tori Riandra gasps as she is suddenly thrust into the hungry cock. Her eye's widening as he entire lower body is now trapped inside of the woman's cock, pulling her arms down she attempted to push herself out only to find that her strength failed her. With the tips of her toes dipped into the warm bath of cum waiting for her Tori let out a moan, the tingling sensation warming her entire body. "Oh.... It feels nice.~" Her body giving a quick quiver.

[23:01] Carlevin: (( You should set your status to match what's happening ))

[23:04] Carlevin flexes her shaft again, pushing her calves down into that hungry shaft, already her skin is starting to melt into cum, the tingling pleasure setting deeper into her body, her body shaking with pleasure still, it feels amazing, overwhelming, like an orgasm that goes on for hours. Her shaft pulsates with lust, flexing again, squeezing, being gentle with her so she just feels that slick, hot cum coating her as she slides down the hungry shaft.

[23:07] Tori Riandra moans out more, her navel now pulled into the woman's shaft, calves melting away filling her with pleasure. Squirming inside the woman's cock Tori giggled playfully, clearly drunk on the pleasure provided for her. "More! More!" She moaned out, overwhelmed. Her petite frame barely visible on the underside of Carlevin's cock bulging out. Streching her hands down Tori tried to pry them inside, wedging her fingers into the slit of Carlevin's cock, pinning her arms to her side.

[23:14] Carlevin slurps her deeper, once it reaches her pussy lips the sensation changes... pleasure explodes through her love tunnel, like it was the most powerful orgasm she's ever had, every nerve lighting up like a forestorm and then going numb as it melts away into cum, the sensation of electric pleasure seeps deeper, as her head vanishes into that cock, so much of her gone now, bleached white cum and bleached white bone all that's left of most of her body now, melting away into cum forever as pleasure explodes through her.

[23:17] Tori Riandra feels an orgasm overtake her as her head is pulled inside, slurped into the cock for good, only to return as a batch of cum. Quivering on the way down Tori managed to utter one brief quick, "Thank you." Before she felt herself lost in the mind shattering pleasure brought upon her. Her hands exploring the walls around her before she fell into the heavy orbs, soaking inside them as the muscles kept her locked inside, time bringing her fate.

[23:25] Carlevin grins down at her nuts, feeling them slosh and churn, her purr warm and soft. "You're welcome." Her nuts churn and squeeze around her finishing the job, melting her away into seed forever. The feline moans and shudders, pumping her hands over the thick rod, panting and huffing heavily, the feline closing her eyes. "oh fuck you feel so good." She shakes, bucking and thrusting, cumming hard all over the floor, gushing out massive waves of hot cum with bones mixed in it, squirting and splattering all over the floor what used to be.... she never asked her name... she shivers, looking at the cumstain... really not having known who it was at all... gushing another big splat of cum at that thought.

To be fair, you have to have a very high IQ to understand the To Be Fair, You Have to Have a Very High IQ to Understand Rick and Morty Copypasta . The humour is extremely subtle, and without a solid grasp of theoretical physics most of the jokes will go over a typical viewer’s head. There’s also Niekish’s autistic outlook, which is deftly woven into his characterisation- his personal philosophy draws heavily from Narodnaya Volya literature, for instance. The fans understand this stuff; they have the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate the depths of these jokes, to realise that they’re not just funny- they say something deep about LIFE. As a consequence people who dislike To Be Fair, You Have to Have a Very High IQ to Understand Rick and Morty truly ARE idiots- of course they wouldn’t appreciate, for instance, the humour in Niekish’s existential catchphrase “To Be Fair, You Have to Have a Very High IQ to Understand Rick and Morty,” which itself is a cryptic reference to Turgenev’s Russian epic Fathers and Sons. I’m smirking right now just imagining one of those addlepated simpletons scratching their heads in confusion as Niekish’s genius wit unfolds itself on their computer screens. What fools.. how I pity them. 😂

And yes, by the way, i DO have a To Be Fair, You Have to Have a Very High IQ to Understand Rick and Morty tattoo. And no, you cannot see it. It’s for the ladies’ eyes only- and even then they have to demonstrate that they’re within 5 IQ points of my own (preferably lower) beforehand. Nothin personnel kid 😎

So I heard that some people believe that being a brony is gay. I told Pyro, Sparkup, amd Merlin this. They didn't like what I said. People should know that not only are us bronies artistic, some bronies are in the military, trained to kill. Some of us, like me, also have very sharp katanas lying around. So, if you have a problem with the idea of older people watching My Little Pony Friendship is Magic, this sword is ready.

All of us men are and have been complicit (willingly or not) in rape culture.
I think back to college, when there was a guy I knew who had a "reputation" and rumors of various degrees of shitty behavior swirling around him. He was one of the guys who sparked enough concern among some of the women on campus that they composed a list of guys to avoid. This list circulated via email (it was the mid to late 90s) around three of the local colleges, my PWI and two HBCUs. This was a whisper network for black women on our campuses to avoid being exploited or worse by these guys.
At the time, many of us guys who were not on the list thought it was just a "don't date him because he'll cheat on you" list. We were, at best, naive. I now know we were complicit in rape culture.
As an aside, I realize now that this is yet another example of why we really should listen to black women.
Anyway, this featured prominently on this list and while I don't have proof, I am sure that those questionable comments he's made and those times I've seen him drinking "with" a woman add up to he raped her. The List didn't save her because it started circulating before she got on campus or because she wasn't friends with anyone who was circulating it. Or maybe she thought as many of us did that it wasn't as serious as it was. None of that matters. I and many others attended parties and other events with this asshole and knew with 99% confidence he would rape someone that night. And we did nothing.
I guess our excuses were, "well, I didn't actually see him rape her" or "how do we know he wasn't just giving her a ride home because she was drunk" or "all that talk is just that, talk".
We knew. And we were cowards. We were complicit. We can hide behind the legal bullshit, like we didn't see anything so it can't be proven or the woman refused to press charges or even accuse him because of the stigma and the pressure she would feel from the community (why were you drunk? Why were you dressed that way? Why didn't you just avoid that guy?) and the fact that the way rape cases are litigated are heavily tilted against the victim.
So I can see where Tarantino is coming from. That is rape culture. We were and are a part of it, and it takes a lot of work for us to fix it. The first step is doing what he just did, which is admitting his role in it. The next step is identifying and dismantling the system which enables these predators so that they can never hurt anyone else again.
It starts with each of us men owning up to our past and present failures. We need to own up to the times our words and actions--and our silence and inaction--either directly or indirectly contributed to rape culture.

While pseudo intellectuals will claim that Rick and Morty is the smartest program on TV, they are clearly lying to themselves in an attempt at looking intelligent. Their brains could not come even close to comprehending the genius of The Big Bang Theory. Not only is  The Big Bang Theory a superbly written comedy, but an allegorical tale that subtlety comments on the Third Reich's prevalence in American society. In the episode "The Panty Piñata Polarization", Sheldon and Leonard are speaking Klingon. Now for those of you who do not know, the Klingons are a race of aliens in Star Trek. In the original series, they are destructive, and are enemies of the federation. One could easily compare them to Nazis. This shows that even the smartest minds have been corrupted by fascist ideologies. Later in the episode, Sheldon gets banned from the Cheesecake Factory, symbolizing America's attempt at resisting Nazi ways. Furthermore, Leonard even compares him to a super villain. Sheldon exacts his revenge, however. He takes Penny's underwear and places it on a telephone wire. Now, this genius scene can be dissected many ways. It can serve as a metaphor for Penny's morals being *stripped* away, or one could also compare it to a method of torture the Third Reich used, electrocution. At the end of the episode, Sheldon's banishment is lifted, proving that no matter how hard America tries to escape the roots o fascism, they will always be there. So the next time you hear "Bazinga" uttered on your television, know that it is not merely a humorous catchphrase, but a symbol of the wounded ideologies of America.

I know right? If I had kids, I would make sure they know the rule "Don't speak unless spoken to." I can't stand it when I'm at my brothers house and he just lets the damn things roam wherever they want, and say whatever they want whenever they want. The worst part is, he doesn't even make them do any work at all! You see when I was a kid, I had to walk uphill both ways to school in the snow every day, and then when I got back home my dad whipped me until I was done hoeing the fields by hand. They were pretty small fields, only about 7 acres, but I found it hard. I once thought about talking back to my dad, but then I didn't because I was good kid who did what he was told and never broke the rules except for that one time or two but that's beside the point. Anyway, truly astonishing that they would let their kids do that, you should probably be calling child protective services because the poor kids are also probably being raised to believe that 9/11 was real and that we evolved from monkeys. Truly ridiculous when you can go to Romania or some other weird Asian country and see tons of monkeys. Did you know that these evolutionist shits actually believe that elements can change into other elements? The world we live in is truly insane. On second thought though, don't call CPS. Murder the parents, adopt the kids and instruct them in the righteous ways of the Lord. Tell them the truth about 9/11 and Obama. It is your duty as an adult to make sure the next generation grows up properly to be good Christian men and women.

Please direct your attention to the cabin crew for important safety information. There is an instruction card in your seat pocket that illustrates the safety equipment on this aircraft. U.S. federal regulations require compliance with this information as well as all crew instructions, lighted information signs, and posted placards. Fasten your seatbelt by inserting the metal tip into the buckle. Tighten by pulling on the belt. To release your seatbelt, lift the metal flap on the buckle. It is the airlines policy that you keep your seatbelt fastened at all times while seated. This aircraft has two forward doors, one on each side, two window exits on each side over the wings, and two aft doors, one on each side. Window exits lead to off wing slides. To operate, remove the handle cover and pull the handle down and in. Doors are clearly marked with exit signs and instructions for door operation. Each door is equipped with an escape slide. In an emergency, lights will illuminate the isle. The cabin is pressurized. If there is a loss of cabin pressure, a panel will open and an oxygen mask will appear. Remain seated with your seatbelt fastened and pull the mask toward you to start the flow of oxygen. Oxygen will be flowing to the mask even though the bag may not inflate. Cover your nose and mouth with the mask. Place the elastic band around your head and tighten by pulling on the ends. Secure your own mask before assisting others. Your seat bottom cushion may be used as a flotation device. Pull up and remove the cushion. Upon exiting the aircraft, place your arms around the cushion and hold onto the straps located on the back. In addition, a life vest is located in a pouch beneath your seat. In a water evacuation, remove the vest from the pouch, throw the flap over your shoulder and pull the vest over your head. Do not inflate the vest until you leave the aircraft. Pull down on the red tabs in front to automatically inflate your vest. To manually inflate, blow into the tubes on either side. A water activated light is attached to each vest. This is a non smoking flight. Smoking is not permitted in the cabin and lavatories. U.S federal regulations prohibit tampering with, disabling or destroying lavatory smoke detectors. Cabin lights will now be turned off. Reading light buttons are located above your seat. Thank you for your attention.

I just wanted to say that I love trans women and traps, especially when I see them use their penises, whether it is to jerk off or fuck someone, I just love it. I wanna have sex with a trans woman so badly, but I don't wanna pay for sex, so I'm stuck with just fantasizing about it. I don't care id it's gay or not, I'd rather be the gayest fucker for wanting to suck a t-girl's cock than just not think about something that brings me so much joy. Thanks for reading.

Natsuki trap is easily the best choise of the cast, one cannot survive without a feminine penis in their lives, hes embarassed about his life choises but he loves to cocktease his dad, so he got beaten up, protagonist kun is a faggot so he wants to help out Natsuki to live a normal life as an average girl, but Natsuki refuses due to being a Tsundere. I feel bad that I cannot suck on his lovely cute feminine penis, if I could, id be sure to make him happy living as a girl.

Anyone else enjoys the feeling of peeing? I think it's a fine feeling. I'm obsessed of drinking liters and liters of water and soda just to pee. It's both exciting and feels good. Sometimes I wake up in the middle of night on violent "pee aches" in my bladder. They're almost painful because of how much of fluid is in my bladder, and I also get erections from it. It's really hard to aim when you really have to pee and your dick is on full boner mode.
I wonder how come I get boners from pain. I remember this one time hitting my toe so hard that it got swollen, and the pain gave me a boner. I'm all messed up like that.

I'm going to regret this, but I'm going to attempt to talk to you rationally. You're embarrassing yourself. You read like a dollar store knock off Professor Umbridge as a moderator in your own sub, and you're here replying to people in a drama sub about you. It's like you're screaming "Oh this is so funny hahaha this is so great you're talking about me look how much I don't care about how you're talking about me!" when everyone knows you wouldn't be here if you didn't care. Stop it. Go find something better to do. This will blow over and you can continue to mod your community as you see fit.


At least until a crowd of secure men come at you with mauve curtains and drag you out.

Man I fucking love hentai!

Like real women are all fine and dandy but some of these artists can make some amazing things. Good hentai is just amazing, and there's basically a great artist for every fetish, futa? We got you, autofelatio? We got you, Into feet? We got you, Big tits? Small tits? We got you. That one with gigantic women with small men? We got you, you into incest? We got you. Basically anything you can imagine has probably been drawn.

I know I'm beating a dead horse here(hell if you're into that there's probably hentai of it) but hentai is amazing and I'm so grateful for these amazing artists that put in so much hard work to give us awesome material to, uh, work with.

Sonic Underground is a great TV show. It's not just great, it's the fucking greatest. Fuck Twin Peaks, fuck South Park, because Sonic Underground is emotional, and makes you question life. In the theme song, one of the lyrics is "abandon your children" and that's a metaphor for how people are too attached to technology and they'll forget about everything around them just so they get likes on Facebook.

A cakewife sounds amazing. A beautiful red velvet cakewife. Her name would be Geraldine, and I can say that because I feel in my heart that I already know her and love her. Maybe I love her more than I have ever loved anyone or anything. What...what am I saying? Could this be for real? Ha. Hahaha. That's ridiculous. Oh, Geraldine. This foolish heart of mine is going to get us into so much trouble.

Oh sorry, did I get lost in myself again? I do that a lot, I'm a very interesting person, you see. My name is Richard, I graduated from Harvard university with a PHD in Theoretical Physics and Neurobiology.

This all happened in one night. We'll call it the transformation . She came over to me at around 10:30 and asked me to dance, being the social person I am, I could not afford to refuse. In an attempt to flatter her I engaged in scientific conversation, it failed and I had to resort to drinking until I was boozy and most importantly, a hell of a lot more sociable.

"Two martinis, please" I told the bartender, a skinny figure of a man-child with a face as egregious to accompany it. "And make it snappy" The woman from before was standing next to me, her hand on the bar, her fingers tapping anxiously on the surface.

When the drinks came, I was annoyed, not just for the fact that it took 5 minutes too long to simply poor a martini from a bottle (imbecile), or because I had nothing to talk about with the lady from before, but also because of the fact that the drink had a peculiar green tint to it. An ugly kind of green tint. The worse part of all was the atrocious taste of the martini's themselves.

I noticed something funny, odd, wrong. My skin was turning a pale, smooth, fruity green. I had spent the best hours of last night applying a ridiculous amount of product to my face and this green look was ruining it. Why was it so tough to breath? I took out my phone. It was that hard on my lungs that I was prepared to call an ambulance.

Before I could speak a word of this terrible pain to my lady friend standing next to me, I dropped to the floor. With saliva pouring out of my mouth, I screamed what could only be considered a scream of help.

"I'm Pickle Rick!" More saliva spluttered out of my mouth. This time around, my hair started to ache, it was falling on to the floor around me, some onto my friend's polished shoes. "I'm Pickle Rick!?" I cried, I didn't know what had gotten into me, I couldn't say anything I wanted to and now the entire building was looking at me, drowning in a pool of my own sick, saliva and the remains of my green martini.

Look, I'm not a hateful person or anything–I believe we should all live and let live. But lately, I've been having a real problem with these homosexuals. You see, just about wherever I go these days, one of them approaches me and starts sucking my cock.
Take last Sunday, for instance, when I casually struck up a conversation with this guy in the health-club locker room. Nothing fruity, just a couple of fellas talking about their workout routines while enjoying a nice hot shower. The guy looked like a real man's man, too–big biceps, meaty thighs, thick neck. He didn't seem the least bit gay. At least not until he started sucking my cock, that is.
Where does this queer get the nerve to suck my cock? Did I look gay to him? Was I wearing a pink feather boa without realizing it? I don't recall the phrase, "Suck my cock" entering the conversation, and I don't have a sign around my neck that reads, "Please, You Homosexuals, Suck My Cock."
I've got nothing against homosexuals. Let them be free to do their gay thing in peace, I say. But when they start sucking my cock, then I've got a real problem.
Then there was the time I was hiking through the woods and came across a rugged-looking, blond-haired man in his early 30s. He seemed straight enough to me while we were bathing in that mountain stream, but, before you know it, he's sucking my cock.
What is it with these homos? Can't they control their sexual urges? Aren't there enough gay cocks out there for them to suck on without them having to target normal people like me?
Believe me, I have no interest in getting my cock sucked by some queer. But try telling that to the guy at the beach club. Or the one at the video store. Or the one who catered my wedding. Or any of the countless other homos who've come on to me recently. All of them sucked my cock, and there was nothing I could do to stop them.
I tell you, when a homosexual is sucking your cock, a lot of strange thoughts go through your head: How the hell did this happen? Where did this fairy ever get the idea that I was gay? And where did he get those fantastic boots?
It screws with your head at other times, too. Every time a man passes me on the street, I'm afraid he's going to grab me and drag me off to some bathroom to suck my cock. I've even started to visualize these repulsive cock-sucking episodes during the healthy, heterosexual marital relations I enjoy with my wife–even some that haven't actually happened, like the sweaty, post-game locker-room tryst with Vancouver Canucks forward Mark Messier that I can't seem to stop thinking about.
Things could be worse, I suppose. It could be women trying to suck my cock, which would be adultery and would make me feel tremendously guilty. As it is, I'm just angry and sickened. But believe me, that's enough. I don't know what makes these homosexuals mistake me for a guy who wants his cock sucked, and, frankly, I don't want to know. I just wish there were some way to get them to stop.
I've tried all sorts of things to get them to stop, but it has all been to no avail. A few months back, I started wearing an intimidating-looking black leather thong with menacing metal studs in the hopes that it would frighten those faggots off, but it didn't work. In fact, it only seemed to encourage them. Then, I really started getting rough, slapping them around whenever they were sucking my cock, but that failed, too. Even pulling out of their mouths just before ejaculation and shooting sperm all over their face, neck, chest and hair seemed to have no effect. What do I have to do to get the message across to these swishes?
I swear, if these homosexuals don't take a hint and quit sucking my cock all the time, I'm going to have to resort to drastic measures–like maybe pinning them down to the cement floor of the loading dock with my powerful forearms and working my cock all the way up their butt so they understand loud and clear just how much I disapprove of their unwelcome advances. I mean, you can't get much more direct than that.﻿

Hollywood has been putting truth in movies for decades. The same people who run Hollywood also run the world. They will always use comedy and movies or tv shows to make these things seem fictional but weather manipulation has been happening for a long time now. It was used in WW2 to rain out enemies forcing them to move locations. It's being used right now to create climate change and steal our tax dollars for weather that is really just created by man. Don't get me wrong not all weather is fake but we have to question when a natural disaster was on purpose or not. Research HAARP. Once you look into this, maybe then you'll be inspired to learn about all the other deceptions currently existing.﻿

I truly do hope you're jesting, because if you are, you really are a good joker, and i salute your deceiving abilities. However, if you're not jesting, then, my dear friend, you are one of those typical hypocrites, and something else, which i will not state here, as i do not desire to burden this comment section with my personal conflicts. Either way, you do not possess "those" prerequisites to judge neither the mod's creator, nor it's users, because, based on those factually disgusting, abominable, body deformation "replacer" mods that you've endorsed, you are about as sick, and as twisted, as you, yourself have ignorantly diagnosed the creator of this mod. All i have to tell you is: "Look yourself in the mirror from time to time, not just you, all with the same tainted traits as yourself, which will never stop plaguing this world, look yourself in the mirror, gaze at it for hours if need be, and i guarantee you, that unless you are too weak, insecure, and dismissive to see yourself as "what" you truly are, you will realize that, "that creature" standing in front you needs to advance a LOT, to rise to the rank of a "Person", beginning with "purging" yourself of those tainted traits, like that blind, pathetic judgementality for example that is madly driving you around, making you spout all kind of ignorant nonsense. Once you pass those beginner "steps", you will, at least gain the ability not to extract, said nonsense when you are too exposed, thus making a nuisance out of yourself, and making an easy mark, a prey able to be "scanned" from inside with no effort. More than that i will not disclose. more than that, will you, yourself prove to me, and my kind, dare you respond in a wrong way. Thank you very much, if you decided to read this, even more if you decided to follow it.

Not only am I extensively trained in taijutsu, but I have access to the entire arsenal of gundams and I will them to their full extent to wipe your miserable anime hater forum off the face of the internet, you little baka. If only you could have known what kind of genjutsu torture your little baka mouth was about to bring down upon you, maybe you would have held your fucking hand signs. But you couldnt, you didnt, and now you're going to be sent to the Shadow Realm, you goddamn idiot. I will go fucking super saiyan 4 kaioken x69 bijuu sage of the six paths demon mode x420 w/ kyuubi 4th form 100% massive yin/yang chidori on your stupid, anime-hating, fuckin mother truckin baka ass. Kawaii desu desu owo! Weeaboo Jones out.

A fellow African American told me that it is a racial statement against white people. "Cracker" is often used by African Americans against white people. Much like the "N" word is to them. So, if the party is "Crack-a-Lackin", it means there are no "crackers", i.e. white people, at the party.

I shake my head in disbelief when I hear this term being spoke by kids and in movies while African Americans laugh about it because white people are too stupid to understand it is a racial slur against them.

You guys are retarded. I tried to tell you AGES ago that Odyssey's shit wasn't as big as you thought. They clearly have linear courses styled after the open hub world's that made you all think thing we're way fucking bigger. Like the clip of Mario jumping off a skyscraper to another one with a fuckload of verticality, they're "above the clouds" with only a few skyscrapers sticking out.

It's not the absolute top of the city world. It's a fucking separate course. You can see in any video of Mario entering the city world that it's not that big and surrounded by a fuck load of skyscrapers that are just background details. As well as no skyscrapers poking out over the cloud line.

I tried to reel in you retards time and time again. You somehow seriously fucking expected well designed platforming in world's as fucking huge as BOTW regions when that's absolutely fucking impossible. While you fucking disappoint yourselves because you expected the world and the moon out of this fucking game. I will be enjoying Mario Odyssey for what it is and what I've known it to be for ages. Sandbox Mario with a dash of 90s rareware collectathon.
You people hyped this game so fucking hard it'd be impossible to meet your expectations unless the entirety of 64 and sunshine and the entire Mario cast were in the fucking game as well as complimentary princess peach fellatio with your purchase.

To be fair, you have to have a very high IQ to understand popping bubble wrap. The humor is extremely subtle, and without a solid grasp of theoretical physics most of the joke will go over a typical popper's head. There's also bubble wrap's nihilistic outlook, which is deftly woven into his characterisation - his personal philosophy draws heavily from Narodnaya Volya literature, for instance. The fans understand this stuff; they have the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate the depths of these jokes, to realize that they're not just funny- they say something deep about LIFE. As a consequence people who dislike popping bubble wrap truly ARE idiots- of course they wouldn't appreciate, for instance, the humour in bubble wrap's existencial catchphrase pop which itself is a cryptic reference to Turgenev's Russian epic Fathers and Sons I'm smirking right now just imagining one of those addlepated simpletons scratching their heads in confusion as bubble wrap's genius unfolds itself in their hands. What fools... how I pity them. 😂 And yes by the way, I DO have a bubble wrap tattoo. And no, you cannot see it. It's for the ladies' eyes only- And even they have to demonstrate that they're within 5 IQ points of my own (preferably lower) beforehand.

It really sucks how during the battle of Stalingrad the north Vietnamese built tunnels under the panzer factories and then stealing the French's type 99 tanks and used them against the invading forces, they almost won until the Brazilian aircraft carrier showed up and launched all their torpedo bombers and took out the tanks. Eventually they Vietnamese retreated back into the tunnels where they stayed hidden from the French forces, later on in the battle the Australians allied with the Vietnamese showed up in their mi-8 helicopter bombers and dropped multiple v-1 buzz bombs pushing back the French to the outsides of Stalingrad. Then the Canadians came in with lend lease North Korean T-34 tanks going back into the city, where close quarters fighting with 152mm howitzers ensued leading to the Vietnamese needing to use their orbital sun weapon- destroying the city and ending the battle in a draw... totally wished the Chinese backed NATO Vietnamese won because now those communist French ruined everybody's lives!

Could not be further from the truth. I am simply here to spread the word of anime to the less fortunate. I think astrophysics and anime go hand in hand, like a sword and shield. Like man and woman, as G-d Himself intended for all of us when he went on that drunken bender 6000 years ago today. You don't think that fucker wasn't watching hentai? We're like his 2D, you ever think of that? Like, he's in something more than 3D, so we're like his 2D, like I just fucking said!! And he could still get it up and bust all kind of holy nuts up in them virgin guts on St. Patrick's Day way back when. That's like jerkin' it to Yoko Littner. Am I really so different, G-d!?!

( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)ಠ_ಠLegislated mandates in sentencing can create some awful tyrannies. I think we need a human dimension to sentencing because I believe that leads, overall, to more humane and constructive corrective value. As long as there is some oversight watching out for unreasonable abusers and a channel to deal with tha t, then I think we are better off in the long run. The law can't anticipate or solve every problem in advance and trying to design it to be that way would make it too unwieldy, burdensome, and in some cases potentially wildly inhumane. Three strikes laws are examples of such failure in the past.

[repeat] [MC Shan:] Me sitting round cool with my dibby dibby girl Police kDetroit Metal City Some say this is There are a couple viable explanations that I have mused about. The first one is the most obvious... Namely that humanity survived into the future without help the first time through... Perhaps just barely. Perhaps only after great loss and long eras of suffering. In this scenario there is no paradox. Why would the future survivors care to reach back in time and aid their struggling ancestors? These humans were apparently masters of time. Maybe from their perspectPeople seem to be overlooking the deviations from the biblical story as sort of random ignorance on the part of the filmakers. But I think these deviations are coherently intentional ... Scott's take on this film seems to have been to cast the plague miracles pretty much as if they were coincidental natural events. And Moses' conversations with God were hallucinatory episodes triggered by a head injury. These hard to believe events culminated in a rebellion by the Hebrews and provoked the one remarkable event that is hard to deny historically: namely, Ramses allowing the Hebrews to leave Egypt. Perhaps Ridley Scott is saying, in essence, "Eventually the story of the Exodus got turned into a miraculous mythology. But here, dear viewer, is a plausible rendering of how it all may have really happened."ive of being able to see through all of time, everyone to them is in the "present" (as was apparent in the tesseract construct). Perhaps they chose to reach back in time to render aid to fellow humans out of compassion, to save a lot of lives -- much as we might render aid to less fortunate people today.the Metalocalypse of anime. It's not. They go in the opposite direction. DMC is about a kid moving to Toky who wanted to be an indie pop act, but for some unexplained reason wound up in a death metal band that he hates. And the comedy comes from him stumbling into situations that are way over his head. He's touted as a metal god who mostly lives up to the reputation by accident. It's sometimes really funny. It was obviously cheaplyYour accusations here are way overblown. Your assertion that there is some sort of quality judgement about one music style over another (akin to racism as you imply above) is just not there. She simply chose a music style that she knew that he did not enjoy. That was the point of the message. You should not force other people to listen to your music because they might not enjoy doing so. Comparing this to Guantanamo torture is just way off base. "Gross overstep"? Hardly! Finally, there's no way he would have to sit and listen to the music for 20 hours straight. He was probably given several sessions to attend... probably something like 5 days in a row for 4 hours each. You just need to wind down a bit and take a look at this again in a couple days.

To be fair, you have to have a very high IQ to understand Umaru-Chan. The humour is extremely subtle, and without a solid grasp of Japanese Otaku culture most of the jokes will go over a typical viewer’s head. There’s also Umaru’s nihilistic outlook, which is deftly woven into her characterisation- her personal philosophy draws heavily from doki doki literature, for instance. The fans understand this stuff; they have the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate the depths of these jokes, to realise that they’re not just funny- they say something deep about LIFE. As a consequence people who dislike Umaru-Chan truly ARE idiots- of course they wouldn’t appreciate, for instance, the humour in Umaru's existential catchphrase "Onii-Chan where's my Cola?" which itself is a cryptic reference to Turgenev’s Russian epic Fathers and Sons. I’m smirking right now just imagining one of those addlepated simpletons scratching their heads in confusion as Umaru's genius wit unfolds itself on their television screens. What fools.. how I pity them. 😂

And yes, by the way, i DO have a replica of Umaru's hamster cape. And no, you cannot see it. It’s for the ladies’ eyes only- and even then they have to demonstrate that they’re within 5 completed anime of my own anime list (preferably lower) beforehand. Nothin personnel kid 😎

I remember the first day I applied the therapeutic masturbation to my son. It felt completely natural as I already had a deep sense of intimacy with my son’s body through the process of massaging him, bathing him, changing his diapers and cleaning and touching his genitals and other private parts. The therapeutic masturbation was a natural extension of what I was already doing in taking care of my son’s body. I also remember how my son expressed a sense of relief, delight and happiness with a smile followed by laughter and other sounds of contentment when I applied the therapeutic masturbation. His body also succumb through orgasm to indicate his enjoyment of the masturbation. The reaction indicated a positive acceptance of the therapeutic masturbation by my son, both physically and emotionally. The therapeutic masturbation also led to a calmness in my son’s behaviour and he continues to show his contentment and happiness to all around him.

I hope you'll shrivel up like a banana slug under salt and feel every cubic inch of it. The pain and unrelenting agony society suffers through everyday is due to scum like you. You pollute the oxygen we breathe, you taint the ground we walk on, you contaminate the material we touch. You're nothing more than a biohazard to Hale-Bopp. The minute the higher ups of our elite culture slaughter you will be the day my tensions ease.

In my eyes, I've been on the internet for a pretty long time. I've ran huge clans, successful communities, been a popular seller of virtual items, and I've spent a lot of time on Discord. Was any of that to toot my own horn as if what I mentioned was super-special? No. But, it was all to say that, I've been in the spotlight, and the center of attention, many times in my life. And the truth is, now that I'm in a period where that isn't as much the case, I enjoy it. Because I enjoy not being in the spotlight ultimately. As it comes with many pressures, and expectations. Pressures I take seriously, as I'm one to not enjoy letting people down

To be fair, you have to have a very high IQ to understand veganism. Its benefits are extremely subtle, and without a solid grasp of animal's rights and nutrition most of the benefits will go over a typical omni's head. There’s also veganism activism outlook, which is deftly woven into its characterization - its philosophy draws heavily from being humble, for instance. The vegans understand this stuff; they have the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate the magnitude of veganism, to realise that they’re not just not eating meat, they say something deep about LIFE. As a consequence people who dislike veganism truly ARE idiots- of course they wouldn’t appreciate, for instance, veganism's self-inflective catchphrase “All omni's are murderers” which itself is a cryptic reference to the slaughter of millions of animals everyday. I’m smirking right now just imagining one of those addlepated simpletons scratching their heads in confusion as veganism’s genius wit unfolds itself before their very eyes. What fools.. how I pity them. 😂

And yes, by the way, i DO have a “All Animals Matter" tattoo. And no, you cannot see it. It’s for the ladies’ eyes only- and even then they have to demonstrate that they have within 5 nutrient deficiencies of my own (preferably lower) beforehand. Nothin personnel kid 😎

You have got to be kidding me. If my christian religion has taught me anything it is to avoid such temptaions such as Rick and Morty. On my moms facebook group they said that Rick symbolized the anti christ by making people turn from religion to think that mild science proves everything. Morty would be the population of earth having to be dragged along  by the devils plan. Justin Roiland has exploited us for far too long and I just think that its tine to end this monarchy on comedy and we could all watch something for people that have an IQ and know how to use it, such as Bibleman ir Donkey Ollie. Using Rick and Morty as a crutch to disprove religion is dumb and idiotic. You cant disprove 6000 years of existence by making one tiny 3 season show at 11pm. I think anyone that has to do with Rick and Morty are going to have a special place in hell. IM LOOKING AT YOU JUSTIN ROILAND AND DAN HARMON.

老实来说，你需要非常高的IQ才能理解《里克与莫蒂》。它的笑点非常地幽默，而且没有对理论物理学有深入的理解许多的玩笑对普通人是听不懂的。其中里克的虚无主义心态，嵌入了他的人格 — 它是沙俄时民意党的哲学写作由来的。这部戏的粉丝会理解这些暗意；他们有非常广泛的知识才会去欣赏它的幽默，再发现到它们不只是好笑 — 它们还描述了关于日常生活的哲学。由此不喜欢《里克与莫蒂》的人的确都是白痴 — 当然一点都不欣赏嘛，例如里克每次喊出的“哇叭叻叭当当”一句本身是在暗示屠格涅夫的《父与子》佳作。只要想到这些目不识丁的蠢材趴着头看着丹尼·哈蒙的大著作令我哭笑不得。无可药救的痴呆们，我真可怜他们。😂 除此我也有《里克与莫蒂》的纹身。你看不到的。 这是给妹妹们看的 — 而她们都要证明她们是我IQ上下5分之内（最好是之下）才能接受她们。

MOTHERFUCKING SHIT. I WAS JUST MASTURBATING AND EVERYTHING WAS GOING GREAT. I WAS IN MY ROOM, I HAD MY HEADPHONES ON, I WAS TOTALLY NAKED SITTING AT MY COMPUTER FAPPING AWAY TO A VIDEO ON REDTUBE. ALL OF A SUDDEN THERE'S THIS REALLY SHARP PAIN IN MY DICK, LIKE IT JUST GOT STABBED WITH A SEWING NEEDLE. I JERKED MY HAND BACK AND IT BUMPED INTO MY COMPUTER TOWER, WHICH SITS ON THE DESK. WELL, I HAD MY STICK OF DEODORANT ON TOP OF THE TOWER, AND THAT BITCH FELL OFF AND LANDED DEODORANT-END-DOWN ON THE HEAD OF MY COCK. HOLY FUCKING SHIT DID THAT HURT, AND ON TOP OF THAT IT HIT SO HARD THAT IT ACTUALLY FORCED SOME DEODORANT INTO MY URETHRA. I'VE NEVER HAD ANYTHING BURN SO BAD IN MY ENTIRE LIFE. I JUMPED OUT OF MY FUCKING CHAIR AND STOOD UP BECAUSE IT HURT SO BAD; THIS CAUSED MY HEADPHONE CABLE TO GET YANKED OUT OF MY SPEAKERS, WHICH CAUSED "OH YEAH BABY COME DEEP IN MY TIGHT TEEN ASSHOLE UH UH UH" TO GET BLARED THROUGH MY FUCKING HOUSE AND ALMOST MAXIMUM VOLUME. NOW MY EYES ARE WATERING FROM THE PAIN OF THE DEODORANT INSIDE MY COCK BUT I MANAGE TO PUNCH ONE OF MY SPEAKERS HARD ENOUGH SO THEY TURN OFF. I LOOKED DOWN AND NOTICED BLOOD DRIPPING OFF OF MY COCK; I GUESS THE LIP OF THE PLASTIC DEODORANT THING BIT INTO MY FORESKIN AS IT CONNECTED WITH MY COCK. THE BLOOD WAS DRIPPING DOWN MY LEG. THIS ALL HAPPENED IN THE SPACE OF MAYBE 6 SECONDS. IT MAY SEEM BAD BUT IT GETS WORSE. JUST AS I'M STANDING THERE TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHAT THE FUCK HAPPENED, MY BEDROOM DOOR FUCKING OPENS. MY DAD WAS STANDING THERE WITH MY ACCEPTANCE LETTER TO CITY HONORS. I FROZE AND HE STARED AT ME, NAKED WITH MY BLOODY ERECTION FOR MAYBE 15 SECONDS BEFORE HE NOTICED MY COMPUTER MONITOR AND THE BRUTAL ANAL SEX SCENE GOING ON FULL-SCREEN. HE IMMEDIATELY CLOSED THE DOOR AND LEFT WITHOUT SAYING ANYTHING. THIS MAY SEEM EMBARRASSING BUT MY DAD IS A SERIOUSLY CONSERVATIVE CHRISTIAN. THIS HAPPENED ABOUT 15 MINUTES AGO AND HE HASN'T SAID ANYTHING TO ME YET. I'M STILL IN MY ROOM TRYING TO GET THE FUCKING OLD SPICE OUT OF MY COCK. WHAT SHOULD I DO?

As a regular 4chan poster since 10+ years ago, I heavily blame 4chan for this shit, although it's obviously not the only contributor to the issue (edit: as in, I realize fascism is not new and obviously has deeper roots than 4chan, but it would be silly to suggest that 4chan isn't hugely popular now or incapable of influencing anyone). 4chan didn't used to be as dominated by fascist shit that it is now, it used to be kind of anarchist/libertarian if anything; it was a bunch of edgy misfits but there was not the type of shit we see on /pol/ now, being a leftist was fine, basically we were just a bunch of kids united by being nerds and outcasts, regardless of our ideologies. 4chan back then just felt very mischievously "counterculture" but that didn't necessarily mean right-wing or left-wing (although looking back...the ingredients for it to take a hard fall towards the right were always there)

I watched it get worse and worse over time. Year after year people would shitpost ironically, and that ironic shitposting would convert into people unironically shitposting, and this would just continue until we are in the state you see today. For that reason I very rarely use sarcasm or irony anymore, because I've realized that inevitably it destroys and drowns out genuine discussion. 

I can tell you from experience in multiple online communities, not just 4chan, that a community with minimal supervision and absolute freedom of speech pretty much always ends up this way. Forums with more moderation often turns into a war of a large segment of shitposters versus "totalitarian" mods who wont let them keep escalating the shitposting cycle--a frustration that is expressed by, surprise, endless shitposting. This eventually splits into new forums created by the shitposters, where the cycle of course continues. 

I remember being a kid and showing up in various chatrooms, forums, etc. before 4chan. What mattered to me? Discussion? Nah. I was there to have fun. I was there to mock the situation as I saw it, to poke fun at the conventions that had been established by the community, laugh at the cliques that had developed around certain users. I would say this is a natural tendency that children and young people have. Young people are new to the world, they see things in a new way, and they see alot of things to laugh at. Anyway, I was not alone; other kids were doing the same thing. So, we'd become a "gang" on a forum, all of us there to have a laugh shaking up the status quo and considering ourselves to exist on a different level than all the people who had been there before and took their forums and personality cults too seriously. After we'd been there a while we would develop our own infamy, people know who we were, we were famous trolls. And guess what? New kids arrived. Those kids *also* wanted to have fun and mess with the status quo. And now we were simultaneously their role models, but also part of the established culture for them to rebel against. And so they did. They applied our same tactics, and made fun of *us* as well in the process. Now *our* little game was over and these kids were spoiling it; but of course we didn't consider that we had just done this to the original inhabitants of that forum...

Now picture that process repeating itself over and over for 10+ years, the "irony" being employed by each new batch of kids inching further and further right, because being ironically racist is the most shocking and taboo thing...And all the while the people who are participating in this are thinking of themselves as intellectually above the general population in some way...

Back in the old days, /b/ was referred to as cancer. If someone came onto another board and disrupted discussion, we would say "go back to /b/". /b/ was a *containment board* and so it became the most taboo board...And so when new kids showed up on the scene, the most appealing thing to do would be to go to /b/ and then disrupt discussions on other boards, who were taking themselves too seriously...Years and years later, the same process continued with /pol/ (another containment board)...And now it's bleeding into the "real world" (although of course plenty of other factors outside of 4chan are to blame as well). "Containment boards" and minimal moderation give a platform to this kind of thing, and look at how it works out every time--and now we are letting people do this shit IRL.

I'm having trouble being concise here but I hope someone sees what I am saying.

He come to me with money in his hand, he offered me, I didn't ask him. I wasn't knockin someone's door down, I was runnin from that. When I got out I was in that, I was already through that, I had that. I had the studio, I went to the studio, I went to Vox studios, I had it all and I looked at it and said this is a bigger jam than I just got out of. I don't wanna take my time going to work, I got a motorcycle and a sleeping bag, and ten or fifteen girls. What the hell I wanna go off and go to work for? Work for what? Money?!? I GOT all the money in the world! Im the KING, man. I run the underworld, guy. I decide who's does what and where they do it at. And why am I gonna run around and act like I'm some teenybopper somewhere? For somebody else's money?!? I make the money man. I roll the nickels. The game is MINE. I deal the cards...﻿

Do you know what the M-97 flamethrower sounds like Ernie? It roars like a dragon, a fiery God purging everything in his path. Hold down that trigger and the whoosh drowns out everything else. Focus on the noise and you can almost convince yourself you don't hear the screams. By the time the tank is empty, everything's over, even the men are quiet. There's nothing but the crackling of burning thatch.

You see Ernie, it's not the noise that keeps me awake at night.

It's the silence.

Greetings everyone. My name..er...code name is: Mysterious Fox Assassin. However, many people call me by my profile picture Adrienn, but I'd much rather be called Luciano as that was my alias given to me. I like anime, Pokemon, swords, and quiet places. Oh, and snow. I enjoy snowy, winter nights. I dislike pretty much the opposites of my likes and insensible persons. I mean, honestly.
 
Anyway, I'm pretty new to the community even if I did lurk on some forum posts, so I'm pretty excited to be with you all. I'm training to be a spriter since it's always fun to make your own character and such. I'm also a good storywriter. (Just prepare yourself for darkness should one of you actually ask me to write one.) I say all this to say, thank you all for inviting me to such a wonderful community. I hope we may become friends, allies, and all other lofty companion tiles in the near future. One last thing is I love Japan. Bye now. 
 
~Luciano

I could barely hold my laughter as I cucked these poor normalfags today.
I decided to go to my stepdad's house as he is away for the weekend. Even if it mean walking, I dressed up because why the fuck not?
I dressed up, wearing an elegant black coat, grey suitpants, and brown dress shoes that make a very loud knocking sound as you step, with of course a gold watch.
Walking on the street like that was hilarous. I saw normies with big eyes looking at me, saw poorfags trembling as they saw my expensive clothes. Just as they spotted me their confidence immediately dropped, I destroyed them. Young, good looking, and confident. 


I cant express how hilarous it is to see normies bow down to the jew god, the money. Ubermensch is written all over their foreheads as they start to imagine how better their life would he with more money. They could even have as an elegant, clean, and stylish look as me, but their eye blinded doesn't let them. They could at least own luxuries, but they are so cucked by their small normalfag minds that they rather spend it on weed, alcoholism or stupid shit they dont even need.


If you are even a bit wealthy you have to try this, because it just opens your eye on how people are cucking themselves with social media, feeling good, and having downright retarded ideas about true happiness

Worst part about gatekeepers like you is that you guys think it makes you smarter than others because of how "edgy" your stuff is. I appreciate edgy memes too but you guys are just annoying. Talking like you're the meme Messiah or something. Calm down dood let the 10 year olds have their fun. People can be annoying. GET OVER IT. I bet you make fun of the "high IQ" RAM guy with memes even though you just did the same thing with memes.

Sad.

I don't get why people say shit like "I feel bad for anyone who thinks she isn't beautiful"... Like why on earth would you give a shit about what other people think? It's a fucking opinion which means there's 2 sides to every fucking arguement... Personally I don't like this, she's not thicc, she's a bit overweight. Accept it, do something about and move on... Fucking hell, everyone get's so fucking butthurt on the internet it's just pathetic... it's like they're all like snowflakes or some dumb shit

Just shut the fuck up. This copypasta was never even funny to begin with. I've never even seen the show, and it was obviously a joke. What kind of idiot do you have to be to think that was ever said seriously? But it makes fun of something which is popular, and therefore popular to shit on among the contrarians on Reddit. Come on, really. I actually do have to wonder about the IQs of people who like that pretentious copypasta. You know, I sometimes can't help but superiorly smirk as I imagine their dumb faces struggling to understand words on a mere internet webpage. In fact, I sometimes find myself in paroxysms of ironic Schadenfreude as I envision the visages of the aforementioned Slow-in-the-minds waging war with the Cultural Artifact they proclaim to be analyzing, only to fall, slack-jawed, back into their insensate stupor, the proverbial Undiscovered Country, "from whose bourn no traveler returns" .

To be fair, you have to have a very high IQ to understand the genius of ROBLOX. The humour is extremely subtle, and without a solid grasp of ROBLOX youtube content, most of the jokes and funny content will go over a typical watcher's head. There's also David's communistic outlook, which is deftly woven into his platform- his personal philosphy draws heavily from Diary of a Roblox Noob: Prison Life literature, for instance. The players understand this stuff; they have the mental capacity to truly appreciate the depths of ROBLOX YouTuber jokes., to realize they're not just funny- they something deep about ROBLOX. As a consequence people who like ROBLOX truly ARE idiots- of course they wouldn't appreciate, for instance, the humour in David's existential catchphrase "OOF," which itself is a cryptic reference to the Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn epic The Gulag Archipelago.

I find it very unintellectual and very offensive that some, ugh, SIMPLETONS think it's funny to say that Rick and Morty season 3 isn't as good as the first two seasons, that leads me to believe that they're obviously intellectually inferior to me, someone who has the brain capacity to understand the dynamics and chemistry that makes Rick and Morty season 3 such a masterpiece. Also, all these pseudo-intellectuals thinking it's FUNNY to make fun of us out of jealousy, like these dumb redditors who think they're SOOO smart when they make fun of Rick and Morty fans. Like, what's so funny in spamming this dumb phrase "To be fair, you need a very high IQ to understand Rick and Morty". These "reddit chefs" are in fact making fun of themselves, because they're throwing away someone's real intelligence away. I'll be off, reporting all trolls. Wubba lubba dub dub!!!

I'm assuming that Valve has received a couple of complaints back in the day about the jump-after-shooting mechanic from whiney bitches who tried to "main" the class but got counter-bitch-fucking-slapped by Karma after they bodyshot instead of landing a headshot when they should've - judging by my friend's archaic demos, headshotting during such situations was feasible, you just had to click on their heads which happened to be in the fucking air cuz you see, they were jumping... Nowadays, and I'm speaking based on experience, I feel like any half-brain-dweeb-degenerate-opportunist-coward oh and, retard (might I add) can play this class: they bait you, pretending they're scoping to take a shot at you but then abruptly unscope so they have more mobility and (meanwhile) you're scoped in, completely static for a millisecond, take a shot, miss and then get fucked. This type of mongrel breed is called the "Second Scoper". Personally, I feel like that takes away all the honor. I hate playing cheap like most sniper main TF2 kiddies do, who think they've got skill. Sure, you can 2nd scope on accident and that's forgivable (for example, you're scoped into a corner, you see nothing and decide to unscope and look elsewhere and suddenly a dude appears, sees you and scopes at you as you unscope... that's excusable), but unfortunately that's not always the case. Also, how the fuck are you supposed to kill multiple snipers quickly when you're solo? You shoot one you have no chance to get the 2nd one without him putting a bullet in your skull (because you're so damn vulnerable after taking the shot). Are we supposed to be 'sneaky' in these situations? Is this what it came down to be? Sniper - the new SPY class. At least in CS:GO you're able to switch from a sniper to a different, as effective and reliable weapon (like the AK47, for example). What I mean to say (and meant for a long time) is that you Valve, officially ruined this class, you've limited its potential, as a capable, skill-requiring class... now don't give me that bullshit saying: "Oh, b-b-but Sniper's a Support class." Fuck that. Heavy / Demo are "Defense" classes but they manage to demolish entire teams - with just one medic. Nahhh mean? Bring that mechanic back, plox. I really want to try it. We'll start a petition if we have to.

Hello.

I am really interested in your game, as I really loved it from the first time I saw it. You have done a great work with this game. You have a great talent. But, I can‘t find this game in the video game stores of my country (Greece) and steam wallet cards and paysafe prepaid cards don't even exist here. I have searched in every single store with video games, but they can't help me. Unfortunately, I don't own a bank account or a credit card. I wish I could ask my parents, but we are quite poor and they will
simply refuse and I understand that. So I actually can't use any of the payment methods Steam requires. Is it possible for you to give me a free copy of the game (or a steam key, I don't want you to
think I am a scammer asking for drm-free version of the game for pirate purposes. I have no bad intentions) just for this extremely special situation? I literally have no other ways to buy your game...

I don't fuck around with "strategy". I just be myself. If am really feeling someone, I superlike them. My friends tell me that's dumb because it makes the chick think she's better than me. I don't give a shit. I don't proceed to worship the ground they walk on after a superlike, I just use it as a near guarantee that I have a chance to make conversation with them. Seems to work pretty well.
Then again I'm also not looking to get laid as much as I'm looking for a potential life partner.

In order to be most equitable, one must have a considerable degree of intelligence to comprehend Richard and Mortimer. The comical aspect is superlative in its subtlety, and absent a firm understanding of quantum neutrino fields, much of the aforementioned comedy would be lost upon the common stock consumer of television. Furthermore, whereas Richard's nihilistic personal philosophy - being so inconspicuously threaded into his own being - is so evocative of thoughts contemporary to the Narodnaya Volya political movement, is but another exemplification of this thesis. True fanatics are capable of this astute understanding; they alone being blessed and cursed with the tragic realization: this is not mere humorism, but a much deeper statement on the FUNDAMENTAL TRUTHS of human existence. Perhaps inevitably, those not fanatically engaged in the contemplation of Richard and Mortimer ARE UNEQUIVOCALLY AND OBJECTIVELY buffoons - it should come as a surprise to none that they cannot grasp the irony in Richard's ubiquitous existentialism "Wubba Lubba Dub Dub," a literary subterfuge referencing Turgenev's opus, Fathers and Sons. I simper at the thought of such an addlepated simpleton (sic) struggling like a fool as Daniel Harmon exposes his intelligence and strokes it furiously in their presence through the medium of television. Would that they were simply aware of their deficiency... They have naught but my condolences.

As an enlightened, modern parent, I try to be as involved as possible in the lives of my six children. I encourage them to join team sports. I attend their teen parties with them to ensure no drinking or alcohol is on the premises. I keep a fatherly eye on the CDs they listen to and the shows they watch, the company they keep and the books they read. You could say I'm a model parent. My children have never failed to make me proud, and I can say without the slightest embellishment that I have the finest family in the USA.
Two years ago, my wife Carol and I decided that our children's education would not be complete without some grounding in modern computers. To this end, we bought our children a brand new Compaq to learn with. The kids had a lot of fun using the handful of application programs we'd bought, such as Adobe's Photoshop and Microsoft's Word, and my wife and I were pleased that our gift was received so well. Our son Peter was most entranced by the device, and became quite a pro at surfing the net. When Peter began to spend whole days on the machine, I became concerned, but Carol advised me to calm down, and that it was only a passing phase. I was content to bow to her experience as a mother, until our youngest daughter, Cindy, charged into the living room one night to blurt out: "Peter is a computer hacker!"

The European Union is the most glorious organisation in all the universe. A better organisation hasn't ever existed, nor will it ever exist. This is fact. Undeniably proven by the scientific prowess of the highly intelligent people of Europe. All geniuses, as is merely befitting their upbringing. All else is lies. Do not listen to the ignorant foreigner; they haven't experienced Europe, so they do not know truth. They know naught but lies. The European Union is glorious. This is truth. We are glorious, and thus, you are glorious. You are Europe.

All bow before Her, mightiest of all, oh European Union, oh beloved bortherhood! All submit their will to Her, She who rules all, oh European Union, oh band of likeminded brothers and sisters! A family, ever supportive, ever benevolent, ever caring. Always there for you in times of need. Your closest companion and your dearest parent, and so much more, that is the European Union. She loves you, and asks for naught but you returning Her love.

Together, brothers and sisters of Europe, we shall usher mankind in a most glorious age of freedom and liberty. Of wealth and prosperity. Together, we can make the world a better place, for ourselves, our family, and our descendants. We shall pursue happiness, living our lives in liberty, as the European Union has seen fit to endow upon us. These inalienable rights stand at the core of our Europe.

We are Europe. Each of us a vital, cherished component. Each of us special. Together, we form Europe. A caring Europe, with healthcare and other social initiatives, valueing the precious life of each and every one of us. A free Europe, lacking the bigotry and dogmatism so present in the rest of the world, lacking the religion-inspired irrationality, and lacking the abusive restrictions placed upon society out of fear and bigotry. A happy Europe, with tolerance and empathy, not fearing the immigrant, nor restricting that which we fear, and instead of shunning the foreign, we seek to understand it, to marvel in its wonders. A European family built around compassion. Live and let live. And live we do, in Europe, home of glory.

To be fair, you have to have a very high IQ to understand sexual violence against women.

There's also OP's autistic outlook, which is deftly woven into his characterisation- his personal philosophy draws heavily from Narodnaya Volya literature, for instance. The fans understand this stuff; they have the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate the brutalizing of these whores, to realise that they're not just subhuman- they say something deep about your WIFE. As a consequence people who dislike OP truly ARE gay faggots- of course they wouldn't appreciate, for instance, the humour in OP's existential catchphrase "rough gangbangs," which itself is a cryptic reference to Turgenevs Russian epic Fathers and Sons.

I don't know why A Hat in Time is so popular. Compared to Dark Souls 2, it's a pretty underwhelming game.

Dark Souls 2 has combat and boss fights that are really intense, whereas with A Hat in Time you can usually just one shot enemies with a single umbrella attack and easily dodge projectiles given enough time. To further add onto gameplay, the stealth system is absolutely terrible and broken. You can literally sprint next to guards and they won’t even notice you. However in Dark Souls 2, you can sneak up on enemies and use the element of surprise to attack them from behind.

The movement is very unrealistic and detached from the real world (double jumping, wall jumping, very far dives which can be chained into a longer dive). It should have followed Dark Souls 2's movement and pacing (realistic rolling and surreal fantasy animation). The storyline in this game is childish and the lore is incredibly inconsistent. As an adult male individual who has a job, I found it ridiculous that the Mafia (notorious gang known for many criminal deeds and illegal activities) cannot be beaten by a 10 year old girl equipped with a mere umbrella, how is that suppose to make any sense? Why is it that there were never spyglasses in the spaceship beforehand when the game starts? How can space crack the code to the safe and vacuum out all of the time pieces from the start? Why was there no safety airlock system to prevent this from happening? The game continues to ridicule me as if I was an infant - which I am not mind you, I am an adult male with a job - and doesn’t stick to its lore. Contrarily in Dark Souls 2, the lore is very consistent and the storyline is very interesting for fellow employed men like me. Overall, this game is something I cannot recommend for it is absolutely nothing in the slightest similar to Dark Souls 2 and doesn’t even bother having familiar traits of it.

So me and my girl decided to do some ass sex earlier today, she was all giddy and excited and so she was naked and got on all fours and wiggled her ass. I was super excited too so i went in there no condom and no lube, i went full force in there and she moaned like an elephant, im just pounding away and theres no poo on my dick. But then i look down and see a bunch of little worms on her anus and crawling on my penis, i pull out quickly and go to wash it off in the washroom but i notice one trying to get inside my peehole, i try to grab it but its too small and it goes inside. My girlfriend is frantic apologizing and we dunno wtf to do and im panicking hardcore. Then my girlfriend is like "u need to jizz right now to blow it out before it lays eggs inside of ur dick!" Thats quick thinking by my worm infested girlfriend. 

So i start to jerk it hard as fuk super fast, and within like 30 seconds im close to climax. Fuk my girlfriend though disgusting girl she should wash her anus better, i jump in the air and jizz right in her face as she squirms, i then see like a dozen worms fly out my peehole and land on her face. She starts screaming as they enter her nose and mouth. I only thought 1 went in but apparently a ton went in when i did her in the butt. wut a weird day man im never doing anal without a condom again.

The first time I dabbed I knew there was something more to the simple dance move than met the eye. There was something about the dab that was special. Something, dare I say, powerful.

I've done research on the matter, of course, and I've started to pick up on clues. The angle of the arm where you tuck your head (henceforth known as the "Dabbing Arm") and the aerodynamic angling of the extended opposite arm (henceforth known as "The Rudder") create a symbol of power that was once used by ancient mystics. Why these wisemen used the Dab Symbol is unknown to modern scholars and is a matter of hot debate, but I believe that early man had discovered the potential power in the dab. Over millennia, unfortunately, it appears that mankind had forgotten about the dab.

That is, ladies and gentlemen, until recently. The Dab has resurfaced, supposedly starting around Atlanta, Georgia (though that's a matter of debate in the Professional Dabbing Community), but this begs to question *why*? Why has dabbing returned? Could it be that there are forces at work beyond our conception pulling the strings? Perhaps a benevolent God or deity has decided that our society was ready to embrace the dab, and that through Dabbing we shall reach enlightenment. On the other hand, it's also possible that the power of Dabbing was reintroduced into society be someone meaning to sew chaos. If the sort of awesome powers that stem from dabbing could be wielded by a complete novice then who could say how much collateral damage could be taken?

I believe that dabbing is connected to the Ancient Egyptians. Think about it; when you dab your Dabbing Arm is bent at approximately a 45 degree angle. The pyramids are also triangular and are roughly 45 degree angles. Start to see connections? Madonna understood this, which is why she wrote the song "Walk Like An Egyptian". Madonna truly is one of the brightest minds of this century.

But that's not it. There's more about Egypt than most would think. Who was hiding out in Egypt, and had incredible powers? That's right, Dio Brando. Was The World a Stand brought about by mastering dabbing? Perhaps not, though images from the Speedwagon Foundation paint a very convincing picture. [I'll let you be the judge.](https://img00.deviantart.net/6e94/i/2017/106/7/6/kono_dio_da_b__by_apocalotaurus-db6153a.jpg)

I've almost mastered the Dab, and when I finish my studies and research my power will be absolute. No one will be able to stop me. All the fundies and roasties will feel my strength. The Chads and Staceys will cry and scream "Please, u/Piffinatour, don't kill us!" and I will proclaim "Forget Gumwaa. Have Funwaa!" as I destroy them with my concentrated Dabs. The day of retribution is nigh, brothers. Some of you are alright, don't come to school tomorrow.

So, I'm just a normal smart guy, was watching some R&M in typical normal smart human fashion when my phone buzzed. It was a text from, can you believe it, my girlfriend. The text contained a few short words: "Come over, my parents aren't home." Obviously, I had to stay to finish the episode, but once that was done I headed straight over.

So yeah, we started. We agreed on a pullout strategy (too poor for contraception) so we started. Then, out of nowhere, she said "WUBBA LUBBA DUB DUB." I felt a moment of panic and yet immense pleasure as suddenly my dick turned into a fire hose of seminal fluid. The process of meiosis sped up to an unnatural rate and suddenly half my mass was gone. That's when I passed out.

Anyway, I'm in a hospital, writing this. I think I'm on the road to recovery, next time I don't think it's a good idea to reference the orgasmic experience that is Dan Harmon's genius. 

You're probably wondering about the state of the relationship. Obviously, both of our sets of parents found out because, well, ambulances and shit, but once they heard about the whole "Wubba lubba dub dub" incident, they immediately forgot about the whole thing and told us we could stay together without any consequences. Behold, the power of Rick and Morty.

I had arranged to meet with a woman named Claire. She invited me over to her place after making the first move. A little forward I think to myself, but hey it's 2017 after all, why not? And so I drove over to her quaint little abode a few miles north of campus. Upon knocking I would've sworn I heard multiple voices. She opens the door and moonlight illuminates her features. I think to myself, "Okay, product as advertised, so far so good." She beckoned me in quickly, offering me a drink and guiding me to the living room. The multiple voice enigma had all but faded from my mind. The place appeared to be as empty as my collection of clever similes. After the usual smalltalk she puts on the tv for we had agreed prior that we were to watch the entirety of the bee movie in French. I know what you're thinking. French!? How will you keep up with the plot!? What kind of madman are you? But yes. French was not a problem for Claire and I had both committed the entirety of the bee movie script to Memory. 20 minutes in we are amazing each other with our fluency of the bee movie script. Finding each new quotation as arousing as the last. Suffice to say tension is building. "What do you say we narrate this fantastic film with the lights off," she suggests. I agree gladly excited by the prospect. With the light no longer absorbing the darkness of the room we our engulfed in it and in our bee movie fervor we literally start to perceive one another as bees. She begins slowly buzzing her wings against my stinger. I cry out that she must stop both for her sake and mine as we all know bees may only sting once before they are swallowed into the abyss. But she lives for danger or so she tells me. After bringing me very near the point of certain stinging demise she lessons the beat of her wings. You'd think I'd be relieved but my thoughts merely echoed the age old song of our people. Yellow black. Yellow black. Black yellow? Yes. She leads me to a flower. She flies upstairs. I follow. Waiting for us in the upstairs bedroom is...you guessed it. An enormous flower mine for the pollination. In my excitement to help the flower reproduce asexually I forget my fellow bee's presence. Time slipped by. An eternity may have been a second and a second an eternity, truly time itself was bending around me as I pollinated that flower. As if awoken from a dream, the lights come on. There never was a flower. I look down to see a strange naked man before me and reality strikes. Claire sits behind me cackling with a laughter that made my skin crawl. "The bee movie is a joke," she yells. Too stunned and hurt to even reply I promptly run out of the home and drive away. To this day I still don't know what was in the drink I consumed. Perhaps I was merely entranced by my love for the world's greatest film. I can only say what I saw and experienced. What actually transpired is still a mystery to me. All I know for certain is that the following week I tested positive for chlamydia.

I see what you're saying, from that perspective it becomes apparent that we have differing views on the semiotics at hand, the way we've interpreted the definition of "contribute" seems responsible for this disconnect. By the context you provided and your logic I'd agree with you. The way I see it, if I am the first to post on something (I made my initial comment when the post was only seconds old, knowing it would likely gain momentum) because I assumed there are other people out there who dislike cheese and are subscribed to r/coolguides. My logic was that my contribution to the discussion is opening up the thread for people who dislike cheese to make further contributions based on mine, such is the way of reddit comment chains. It isn't meaningful to the subreddit, I agree 100%, if I implied otherwise it was unintentional. And I said you "cannot downvote according to reddiquette" which is all the difference there. You can do whatever you want, I don't care, abuse the downvoting system or not. It doesn't really affect me, I personally advocate that the downvoting system just be amended so that it is consistent with its current form as users see fit. But until then it is there for a reason. If I'd said "you cannot downvote" well that wouldn't be a true statement, you can. That's like someone saying "you cannot murder another person according to the laws of the U.S.A." Everyone knows you can attempt to murder someone at any time, if you say "you cannot murder anyone" then you're lying. If you phrase it with the disclaimer in accordance of a statute or law you can cite, then your logic is sound, true, and justified. I specifically belabor the point and provide those disclaimers because I know if I do not then someone might come along and say otherwise. One thing I want to say is that you claimed speaking out in defense of reddit won't work out well for me, this entire thread existing is getting my point across, much like how Socrates or Kaczynski got exactly what they wanted because to them getting their point across for the sake of humanity was all that mattered. I don't care if I personally have a million upvotes or a million downvotes on a comment. All is now at least 100 readers who had no idea reddiquette even existed and who have been using the downvote functionality incorrectly are now more aware than they were 24 hours ago. That is my goal. Out of those 100 it's safe to assume a decent percentage will go a review the reddiquette and potentially adhere to it moving forward until reddit amends it appropriately. I mentioned many of these points in replies to previous comments but the problem with abuse of the system is it impacts legitimate and potentially relevant users in a way that was not intended by the developers. You see, when you downvote something it is meant to be a deterrent from things such as trolling or spamming, because with enough of those votes you are then limited to the amount of contributions you are able to make in a given time frame, therefore when people downvote someone they disagree with they are effectively silencing and oppressing real humans. This is not okay. I don't personally care, but a new redditor who expresses an unpopular opinion and is then downvoted might be deterred altogether from the site without understanding why they're now limited with their posts. I don't want this. I don't imagine you do either, which is likely why you said you wouldn't downvote my comment. The only thing I'm concerned with is that a lack of adherence to the principles outlined in reddiquette directly impacts users and counter-intuitively works against the very nature of the system- people use it as a like/dislike feature. There is a reason reddit and other media sites such as FB publicly advocate against dislike features, the very logic behind this is grounded in pathos. So it doesn't seem we're in disagreement with one another at this point. It seems, as usually is the case for me, there was a misunderstanding that could've been easily resolved if we just agreed on a definition of a "meaningful contribution" before engaging in discussion. Language is prescriptive like that, and evolves with use, not everyone has the same perspective of each word, much like the voting system of reddit, it is there for a purpose, its original form, regardless of current function. "Contribution" is defined in the OED among other places and lends itself to interpretation- but is amended appropriately over time with its use. Just like the word "conversate," which wasn't a real word for years, but over time has been amended into the OED because of its widespread popularity and use. Just like hopefully not too far into the future reddit will just amend their reddiquette link to state that you can downvote people if you disagree with them. But that doesn't solve the issue of downvoting out of disagreement effectively silencing users and impacting them negatively as a result. So the policy prescription I propose is a four way voting system. The top and bottom arrows can be used as they currently are intended, for relevancy and contributions. The left to right arrows can be used to express likeness or dislike. That way people can negatively sidevote you all they want without it affecting your ability to communicate with them. I have much more to say on this and for years I've posted this ever since reddit gained in popularity and with it came the abuse of the system, I'm sure you- as another fellow redditor from the olden times when it somehow looked even more archaic- noticed as well. As for the edit, my comment was trending downward long before the edit. I have no idea if the majority of my downvotes came from that or not, as it is irrelevant, since they shouldn't have been inspired by either. It's funny, context is everything. Every other day it seems on various accounts I'm writing these same comments in regards to the system, usually in defense of others who've been victim of abuse of the system, and every other day they are downvoted into oblivion or gilded and top comment material. Illustrates the hivemind mentality quite well.

What goes through a person mind when they decide to enter a game, sit there for hours just to press the shift button and hold the left mouse click? You tell me, because that's exactly what Tobjorn, or whatever his nazi name is, players do. I would feel just bad for picking that dwarf, like how bad can you be to put yourself under such circustances? I know some people that don't have arms and legs, and 9 out of 10 pick Tobjorn (that other one person picks Reinhardt), but you? You have both arms and legs so what's your excuse? Hell, pick 76, he has an ult that aims automatically, but at least you will have a certain amount of dignity. Me, as a Genji player, am teaching you how to become less of a disgrace, since i have 2 stars more when it comes to hero dificulty. So please, do a favor to your mother and dad, don't disonor them so much. Don't pick Tobjorn. Just don't.

I don't need a stupid flu shot. I have an immune system that protects me just fine. Never got a flu shot, nor have I gotten the flu (not since high school when I caught it from someone), and nor will I ever allow myself to be jabbed with syringe brimming with toxins that would do more harm than good.

To be fair, you have to have a very high IQ to understand Annoying Orange. The humor is extremely subtle, and without a solid grasp of Pomology, most of the jokes will go over a typical viewer's head. There's also Pear's nihilistic outlook, which is deftly woven into his characterisation - his personal philosophy draws heavily from Narodnaya Volya literature, for instance. The fans understand this stuff; they have the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate the depths of these jokes, to realize that they're not just funny- they say something deep about LIFE. As a consequence people who dislike Annoying Orange truly ARE idiots- of course they wouldn't appreciate, for instance, the humour in Orange's existencial catchphrase "Orange Nya Nya Style" which itself is a cryptic reference to Turgenev's Russian epic Fathers and Sons I'm smirking right now just imagining one of those addlepated simpletons scratching their heads in confusion as Dane Boedigheimer's genius unfolds itself on their television screens. What fools... how I pity them. :joy: And yes by the way, I DO have an Annoying Orange tattoo. And no, you cannot see it. It's for the ladies' eyes only- And even they have to demonstrate that they're within 5 IQ points of my own (preferably lower) beforehand.

Since I have seen a lot of people commenting things like "fuck anime, this is the real Japan" I'm gonna leave this copy paste of a comment I made about this when I started uploading Japanese songs, just In case ye haven't seen it:
Anime was a big thing in japan since 1930, and by the 40's  anime was well established in Japan as an alternative format to the live-action industry, animators even benefited from the patronage of the government, which employed them to produce educational shorts and propaganda and the first full-length anime move was made in 1944, I know this may hurt... but anime and fascism can coexist.﻿

Walks on stage

Ahem

Taps mic

Audience leans in

"Everything..."

Entire audience gasps in suspense, removing all oxygen from the room and creating a vacume in the theatere

SFX guys on the catwalk fall to their deaths as the vaccum caused by the audience sucks them downwards

"Is..."

Entire audience leans in more intensely, causing the earth to change its axial tilt by 1°

Santa implodes due to not technically living on the north pole anymore

The speaker, clinging to the microphone for dear life to avoid being sucked into the vaccum created by the audience, utters the final words of his speech

"Slowly dying"

The audience collectively cheers and gives a standing ovation, blowing the speaker through the back of the building

All novel philosophy prizes are immediately revoked and awarded to the speaker

All future children are named after this momentous speech, every national anthem is replaced with an audio recording of "Everything is slowly dying"

Fín.

"I was seriously just eating dinner!" I screamed at KD from across the restaurant. All night my Twitter had been blowing up with tweets @ me from accounts like "rings_are_life" and "durantisbest" and "champs2017KDKD" accusing me of not respecting KD's choice to get tomato soup and grilled cheese off the kids menu at this local restaurant. I swear all I did was freaking pass him on my way to the bathroom and look and say "oh hey KD, congrats on the very difficult and hard earned ring" and pointed at his tomato soup and said "nice, dude, tomato soup!" A couple members of his entourage immediately got in my face and walked with me all the way to the bathroom murmuring things like "most efficient scorer...best guy...awesome dude..gets up so early" and cursing me out and giving me little pinches. Once I was done I went back to my table and there were like 59 Twitter eggs reaming me out. I ate as fast as I could and tried to pay, the waiter said "no, that tall guy over there already paid for your meal, he said money doesn't even matter to him and that he would much rather win rings and have fun times with good friends and good people and win all the time for sure"

Whenever I get a package of plain M&Ms, I make it my duty to continue the strength and robustness of the candy as a species. To this end, I hold M&M duels. Taking two candies between my thumb and forefinger, I apply pressure, squeezing them together until one of them cracks and splinters. That is the “loser,” and I eat the inferior one immediately. The winner gets to go another round.
I have found that, in general, the brown and red M&Ms are tougher, and the newer blue ones are genetically inferior. I have hypothesized that the blue M&Ms as a race cannot survive long in the intense theater of competition that is the modern candy and snack-food world. Occasionally I will get a mutation, a candy that is misshapen, or pointier, or flatter than the rest. Almost invariably this proves to be a weakness, but on very rare occasions it gives the candy extra strength. In this way, the species continues to adapt to its environment.
When I reach the end of the pack, I am left with one M&M, the strongest of the herd. Since it would make no sense to eat this one as well, I pack it neatly in an envelope and send it to M&M Mars, A Division of Mars, Inc., Hackettstown, NJ 17840-1503 U.S.A., along with a 3×5 card reading, “Please use this M&M for breeding purposes.” This week they wrote back to thank me, and sent me a coupon for a free 1/2 pound bag of plain M&Ms. I consider this “grant money.” I have set aside the weekend for a grand tournament. From a field of hundreds, we will discover the True Champion. There can be only one.

Everybody telling me i can do better than him keep reading ok? 1st of all he's all i want in life 2nd He makes me happy, he cares about me, he loves me, and he's always there when i need him that's important and i haven't found it anywhere else.
4. He deals with my bullshit and very rarely do we fight. 5. Idk if i said this already but.....IM HAPPY WITH HIM!!! That's all that matters to me is that we're very happy together and we are so your opinions aren't really needed.
I appreciate the people saying I'm too good for him because I'm "an amazing person and he isn't that great of a person" but I'm also gonna tell you this he has never been abusive or anything like that towards me soooo like we're pretty good for now
He's always really sweet and kind. He gives me his hoodie when it's cold out even if he knows he's gonna be really cold. He forces me to wear it even if I have a hoodie but i eventually give it back because i don't want a popsicle for a boyfriend 
He makes me feel safe wherever i am and i trust him which isn't easy for me to put my trust in a guy. He texts me as much as he possibly can and he shows  me that he cares. I don't want huge gestures i just want him to remember stuff and he does
He makes sure i know that he loves me he tells me every five seconds he makes sure I'm ok and he makes sure I'm happy he gets jealous but it's ok because he isn't obnoxious about it he tells me that talking to certain guys bothers him
He also says he doesn't care if I talk to them because he doesn't want to seem controlling he tells me not to talk to people that he knows because he doesn't want them ruining our relationship he says right after words thag he hates being controlling
He also says that he loves me way too much to just sit around and let them come in between us. He proves that he loves me because he remembers the little things. Like I'm claustrophobic. When we sit with each other on the bus he
Always sits on the inside cause he knows if i were on the inside I'd probs have a panic attack. He remembers that i hate spiders. He saw one on the bus and didn't even tell me it was there until after he killed it.
I'm not gonna continue but y'all need to shut your mouths because we're happy together.

No? You know what? Just go away.
Every time someone posts a picture, a gif, a video, a screenshot, or just anything really that involves some kind of "corporate" thing - A video game, a logo, or probably just even the town hall of a city given how overboard you dummies go, you have to /r/HailCorporate it.
I'm done. I've had enough. You can't just spam /r/HailCorporate and expect an upvote. You can't just be like "dude, you're playing a game?" and post /r/HailCorporate. You just can't.
I doubt you even work for corporate given how against them you are. You live in a cardboard box, typing on your CrapBook Pro, feeling good about yourself because you think you just "called someone else out" for being a corporate shrill.
Just who do you think you are? Some epic 12-year-old on the internet with le cool fedora posting about how "corporate shrill hails this, corporate shrill hails that?" Well, I've got news for you. You aren't anything. You aren't epic, you aren't a 12-year-old, and your fedora certainly isn't le cool.
I hope in time you will learn that not everybody and everything is a corporate shrill.

This is how she found out. On YouTube I'm subscribed to some weird channels where people film them selves farting at the camera or in other people's faces. My phone rang because I got a notification of a new fart video. She didn't deliberately go through my phone but her eyes just landed on the screen, she saw what the notification said and out of curiosity she unlocked it. She called me to ask about it? At first I was embarrassed but she said that she has a fart fetish to and to prove it to me she got up, turned around, grabbed my head, put my face in her ass and she gave me a big bubbly wet loud fart 💨. The fart was so loud that I even the neighbors heard it (we live in an apartment). I knew cause I heard them laughing. From this point on she farts on my face all the time and I even fart in her face to. In the morning when we get up, she gives me a big bubbly fart and sometimes I give it to her. Her farts are better then mine. lol. When one of us wakes up before we give each other a big fart instead of a kiss. When I come home from work instead of kissing she makes me sit down and she gives it to me. We are getting married next year and I would not wanna be with any one else. I love this weirdo ❤️

The amount of casual fuckboys here who are willingly on the side of big business just going "Fucking hurr durrrr it's their right to close 'underperforming divisions' hurr durr" is seriously, probably the most disgustingly pathetic thing I've ever seen on this sub and I've seen some shit.
Are you that daft? They "underperformed" so fuck the fuckers, get rid of them? Simple as that, huh? The .xls said they need to be axed so get rid of them, because the numbers don't lie. Forget the corporate behaviors that caused this problem, right?
Are you FUCKING serious? Dead Space was a niche franchise. It sold VERY WELL for a brand new IP in the "survival horror" genre. Very, very well. Dead Space 2 sold AT LEAST 4 million copies. Probably way more - considering 1.6 million of those are on Steam alone and that doesn't include 360, PS3, Xbox One back compatibility, or Origin.
They did not underperform. They made money on Dead Space 1 and 2. They simply didn't make $937587235 which is what EA wants. When your expectations and your budget are based entirely on a fantasy world, every studio underperforms. You cannot release a game that has this specific of an audience and then table flip when it has "only" sold 4 million copies within 6 years. That's ludicrous, unrealistic, and ignorant, in comparison to a game like Resident Evil 4, 5, or 6, all of which have sold at least 7.5 million, and RE4 is over 10 years old. By 2007 and 4 releases including Wii, RE4 had still only sold 1.7 million copies. It takes fucking time.
Do you know why it eventually sold that many copies? Because it's been re-released 9 times. GC, PS2, PC, Wii, PS3, PS4, 360, XB1, PC again, and, it was included in RE6 archvies/anthology version.
Do you know why RE5 sold that many copies? Because it's been re-released. PS3, PS4, 360, XB1, PC and again, and, it was included in RE6 archvies/anthology version.
Do you know why RE6 sold so many copies? Because it's been re-released. PS3, PS4, 360, XB1, PC.
Dead Space trilogy was released one time - 360, PS3, PC. Dead Space 3 on PC was exclusive to Origin, and 2 on Steam does not have the DLC available.
No fucking shit # 2 only sold "4 million" copies.
EA completely mismanaged this studio and drove them into the ground, the same way they do with their acquired 3rd party studios. They had completely unrealistic expectations for DS2 and 3, proving they have no comprehension of the games they are making and are only interested in money.
Do you honestly think any of their other studios get treated this way, assuming EA actually had any other first party studios still open that aren't EA Sports, and actually do anything? (Hint: They don't.) Don't get me wrong - they operate 37 different studios/offices. 3 of them are BioWare, another 3 of them are another developer, 2 of them are EA Sports, etc. But they also don't actually make anything, who knows why, and I bet if they didn't have 28 other needless studios, they might see higher profit margins.
If you defend this and just say "It's within their right and it's expected to shut down underpeforming studios" you have no fucking idea what you're talking about, no comprehension of why anyone is upset, and you need to shut the fuck up because spewing your uneducated opinion means nothing to anyone.
You can't fathom why anyone is pissed off, huh? It's eluding you? Not one possible reason huh?
Dead Space is done. It will never come back. There will never be a plot resolution to $200 and at least 120 hours of millions of people's gaming lives.
The first Star Wars game with any chance of being worth a fuck since 2008 just got its developer closed and it's changing hands to some devs no one knows shit about, because EA didn't like the way it was going. That almost certainly equates to - it wasn't casual and filled with shitty microtransactions enough for the corporate stooges. It was a single-player, story based game with finite - if any- opportunities to continually milk customers for a long term revenue stream.
EA is literally famous for destroying the gaming industry. There are so many articles and websites dedicated to just how much ruin they've left in their wake. They are the Donald Trump of the gaming industry. Yea, sure they may not be 1980s Atari famous, but if another game industry crash does happen, I bet you money it will be EA driving the bus.
Not all of us are 8. EA destroyed our favorite game developers and franchises from our childhood. Command and Conquer, Populous, SimCity, ThemePark, ThemeHospital, Burnout, Mercenaries, Dead Space, these are all relics now because of EA. They also are holding hostage Dungeon Keeper, Crusader, Wing Commander, Ultima, and lots of other IPs.
Many more IPs have sat stagnant for decades and almost disappeared because of their bullshit. System Shock is the most prominent example - it was locked up in legal limbo for almost 2 decades because EA didn't own all the rights - some stupid legal firm owned part of them - and neither was willing to let them go. It is only by the graces of Night Dive and CDP that System Shock 3 is finally happening and System Shock remake is coming out - crowdfunded by the way.
Star Wars, again. EA had a hand in LucasArts demise and has now taken on the Star Wars mantle, through their exclusivity deal with Disney to be the only developer allowed to make Star Wars games. And so far they've totally fucked it up. Battlefront 1 and 2 are both shit, and the only other game they released was a mobile game.
So yea, there is MORE than enough reason to be physically ill about EA.

When I was military I was a submarine door gunner. One day on patrol my co-gunner was running low on oxygen. I, as the senior rank, had the duty of giving him my supply. I can still see the bubbles from my tube as I disconnected it from my breather, and secured it to his. I gently tapped his shoulder, and released my harness to float off to the abyss. Luckily I was found by a passing mermaid caravan. They took me to their shelter and taught me to breath underwater. I took a liking to the only redhead there.

"I'm Pickle Rick!" I laugh to myself. God himself bows before my unbridled intelligence.

My teacher said to me I'm a failure, that I'll never amount to anything. I scoffed at him. Shocked, my teacher asked what's so funny, my future is on the line. "Well...you see professor" I say as the teacher prepares to laugh at my answer, rebuttal at hand. "I watch Rick and Morty." The class is shocked, they merely watch pleb shows like the big bang theory to feign intelligence, not grasping the humor. "...how? I can't even understand it's sheer nuance and subtlety." "Well you see...WUBBA LUBBA DUB DUB!" One line student laughs in the back, I turn to see a who this fellow genius is. It's none other than Albert Einstein.

To be fair, you have to have a very high IQ to understand Rick and Morty. The humor is extremely subtle, and without a solid grasp of theoretical physics most of the jokes will go over a typical viewer's head. There's also Rick's nihilistic outlook, which is deftly woven into his characterisation - his personal philosophy draws heavily from Narodnaya Volya literature, for instance. The fans understand this stuff; they have the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate the depths of these jokes, to realize that they're not just funny- they say something deep about LIFE. As a consequence people who dislike Rick and Morty truly ARE idiots- of course they wouldn't appreciate, for instance, the humour in Rick's existencial catchphrase "Wubba Lubba Dub Dub," which itself is a cryptic reference to Turgenev's Russian epic Fathers and Sons. I'm smirking right now just imagining one of those addlepated simpletons scratching their heads in confusion as Dan Harmon's genius unfolds itself on their television screens. What fools... how I pity them. joy And yes by the way, I DO have a Rick and Morty tattoo. And no, you cannot see it. It's for the ladies' eyes only- And even they have to demonstrate that they're within 5 IQ points of my own (preferably lower) beforehand.

You know when you think about it the word weeb is a lot like chink or beaner, you're essentially giving negative connotation to an entire culture of people who appreciate an art form. I normally don't go this in depth on it but I'm kinda starting to get tired of people throwing around that word when they have no justification to be using it in the first place. At least educate yourself on the subject matter you're dissing know what I mean?

The doctor know sleep is important to us and gives us the sleep.

And I told her: it's not every day. But there are days. Days when I know. When I wake up and at noon and at six pm: I'm not gonna sleep and pain is deep and wide and the chasm of it is inside me.

And she gave me ten nights of sleeping and tonight is that is one of those. It is the first. The light behind my husband illuminates him so that he looks like a saint in the Catholic church. Words feel good in my mouth.

My pain is gone and I am to sleep.

"Huge new update" this is fucking pathetic. The only reason why TF2 is dead is because Valve just doesn't fucking care anymore. All this adds is a bit of variety to things we already had. Tf2 needs something new that will change things up a bit, and gather new players. This game is destined to die soon, thanks to overwatch, and the fact that its basically been abandoned.

Look, I'm not a hateful person or anything–I believe we should all live and let live. But lately, I've been having a real problem with these homosexuals. You see, just about wherever I go these days, one of them approaches me and starts sucking my cock.
Take last Sunday, for instance, when I casually struck up a conversation with this guy in the health-club locker room. Nothing fruity, just a couple of fellas talking about their workout routines while enjoying a nice hot shower. The guy looked like a real man's man, too–big biceps, meaty thighs, thick neck. He didn't seem the least bit gay. At least not until he started sucking my cock, that is.
Where does this queer get the nerve to suck my cock? Did I look gay to him? Was I wearing a pink feather boa without realizing it? I don't recall the phrase, "Suck my cock" entering the conversation, and I don't have a sign around my neck that reads, "Please, You Homosexuals, Suck My Cock."
I've got nothing against homosexuals. Let them be free to do their gay thing in peace, I say. But when they start sucking my cock, then I've got a real problem.
Then there was the time I was hiking through the woods and came across a rugged-looking, blond-haired man in his early 30s. He seemed straight enough to me while we were bathing in that mountain stream, but, before you know it, he's sucking my cock.
What is it with these homos? Can't they control their sexual urges? Aren't there enough gay cocks out there for them to suck on without them having to target normal people like me?
Believe me, I have no interest in getting my cock sucked by some queer. But try telling that to the guy at the beach club. Or the one at the video store. Or the one who catered my wedding. Or any of the countless other homos who've come on to me recently. All of them sucked my cock, and there was nothing I could do to stop them.
I tell you, when a homosexual is sucking your cock, a lot of strange thoughts go through your head: How the hell did this happen? Where did this fairy ever get the idea that I was gay? And where did he get those fantastic boots?
It screws with your head at other times, too. Every time a man passes me on the street, I'm afraid he's going to grab me and drag me off to some bathroom to suck my cock. I've even started to visualize these repulsive cock-sucking episodes during the healthy, heterosexual marital relations I enjoy with my wife–even some that haven't actually happened, like the sweaty, post-game locker-room tryst with Vancouver Canucks forward Mark Messier that I can't seem to stop thinking about.
Things could be worse, I suppose. It could be women trying to suck my cock, which would be adultery and would make me feel tremendously guilty. As it is, I'm just angry and sickened. But believe me, that's enough. I don't know what makes these homosexuals mistake me for a guy who wants his cock sucked, and, frankly, I don't want to know. I just wish there were some way to get them to stop.
I've tried all sorts of things to get them to stop, but it has all been to no avail. A few months back, I started wearing an intimidating-looking black leather thong with menacing metal studs in the hopes that it would frighten those faggots off, but it didn't work. In fact, it only seemed to encourage them. Then, I really started getting rough, slapping them around whenever they were sucking my cock, but that failed, too. Even pulling out of their mouths just before ejaculation and shooting sperm all over their face, neck, chest and hair seemed to have no effect. What do I have to do to get the message across to these swishes?
I swear, if these homosexuals don't take a hint and quit sucking my cock all the time, I'm going to have to resort to drastic measures–like maybe pinning them down to the cement floor of the loading dock with my powerful forearms and working my cock all the way up their butt so they understand loud and clear just how much I disapprove of their unwelcome advances. I mean, you can't get much more direct than that.

Liesel: Hi, I'm Liesel. I have no personality, but I'm a cute little girl. 

Death: Her name is not Liesel. Her name is THE BOOK THIEF and I shall name her that for the rest of the book.

Liesel: Even though I stole, like, 3 books in total or something. 

Death: Shut up, Book Thief.

Rudy: Hello everyone. Have you ever seen a lemon? That's what my hair looks like. 

Death: Here is a little information you should know: this books is filled with many interesting facts. Very relevant and everything. We shall kick off with the definition from the dictionary of the word lemon. 

Reader: The fuck? 

Death: A lemon is a vegetable that is very yellow and acid. That's what the Book Thief's friend's hair looks like.

Reader: That's not a very good description. That's how I picture Rudy now. (view spoiler)

Death: Shut up and read so you can cry, reader.

*Intimidated reader keeps on reading*

Liesel: Papa!

Papa: Liesel. 

Death: Reader, are you crying yet?

Reader: Can you just stop that?

Death: What?

Reader: That. Popping up out of nowhere? 

Death: Get used to it. And keep on reading before I killz you! And woohoho, HERE'S A LITTLE FACT YOU SHOULD KNOW: This book is not gonna end well. 

Reader: Are you serious? You could have used spoiler tags, man! 

*Annoyed reader keeps on reading*

Liesel: Papa, can you play the accordion? 

Papa: Yes, Liesel. 

*Plays the accordion. Everyone else is bored*

Rudy: Hey, Saukerl. 

Death: Listen, reader. Saukerl means bitch, basically, but I suppose it's less brutal if they say it in German. HERE IS ANOTHER LITTLE FACT YOU SHOULD KNOW: A lot of random words will be in German for the sole purpose of making this book look smart and bilingual. But it really is useless as every, and I do mean EVERY word in German is immediately followed by the English translation.

Reader: Errrr. What's the point then? 

Death: Who said it has to be useful? I bet you're one of those ridiculous people who thinks a book has to have a plot? Or that characters have to be multi-dimensional? And you probably think that two metaphors per sentence is too much? Well, YOU ARE WRONG. This book will show you exactly how wrong you are.

Reader: Uh. Why did I pick up this book again?

Death: Because everyone luurved it. And you will, too.

*Skeptical reader keeps on reading*

Liesel: Papa!

Papa: Liesel. 

Liesel: Mama!

Mama: Shut the fuck up, you slut bitch cunt fucking whore. 

Liesel: Okayyy. Rudy?

Rudy: What, Saukerl?

Liesel: I don't know. I'm just bored.

Reader: So am I.

Rudy: Wanna go steal something?

Death: YO, READER. HAD YOU FORGOTTEN ME? HERE'S SOMETHING YOU SHOULD KNOW. What the book thief and the lemon are about to do is going to end BADLY. You have the tissues ready?

Reader: What?

*Random shit happens*

Death: MUHAHAHAHA DIDN'T I SAY THAT WOULD HAPPEN?

Reader: I know. That's why I'm not crying. I kinda knew it, because you TOLD me EVERYTHING before it actually happened!

Death: Shut up and keep on reading.

Reader: But I'm already 524 pages in and nothing's happened yet! Sigh.

*Goes back to reading.*

Rudy: Saukerl, wanna play football?

Liesel: Okay.

*They play football and everyone else is bored.*

Death: HERE IS ...

Reader: Oh, man, not you again!

Death: I AM THE NARRATOR OF THE STORY AND THEREFORE I SHOULD BE TALKING AT ALL TIMES EVEN THOUGH I AM ACTUALLY INTERRUPTING THE NATURAL FLOW OF THE STORY.

Reader: Stop yelling at me. 

Death: This is an information you should know: This was Nazi Germany and A BOOK WAS SOON TO BE STOLEN.

Liesel: Oh, a book. That's nice. 

Death: SEE? IT IS NAZI GERMANY AND YET IT IS FULL OF BOOK THIEVERY.

Reader: Can you just stop glorifying book thievery? It's not that impressive. You make me expect something huge and it's not. So okay, she stole a book. BIG DEAL! It's not that amazing. Stop acting like it is.

Death: *glares*

Liesel: Papa?

Papa: Yes, Liesel? 

Liesel: Can you read this book for me?

Papa: Yes. 

*They read and everyone else is bored.* 

Mama: Hey, you fucking punk ass motherfucking slut, dinner's ready!

Liesel: Coming, Mommy.

Reader: THE FUCK?

Death: Here are two informations that you should know. First, the definition from the dictionary of the word Dinner. Dinner is the main meal of the day, eaten in the evening or at midday. ...

Reader: This is a joke, right? What's the second information?

Death: A JEW IS COMING YOYOYO.

Reader: Thanks. I love to be surprised, so it's pretty cool to see how you spoil EVERYTHING. And practically nothing happens in the first place, so everything that COULD make me care for the book is now ruined. 

Max: Hello, everyone. I am sweet and cliché and nice and Jewish. Love me?

Liesel: Yes! 

Papa and Mama: Let's hide him! 

Rudy: Hey Saukerl, wanna play football?

Liesel: No. Fuck off. 

*Goes to play with Max. Everyone else is bored*

Max: Here Liesel. Look at these 16-pages-long drawings I made for you. 

Reader: Am I supposed to read that? Hey, Editor! 

Editor: Yeah? 

Reader: Why didn't you make the words of these stupid drawings bigger? I can't see shit.

Editor: Not my problem. 

Reader: Fine. I just won't read it, then. 

Editor: 'S fine. You think I actually read them? Ha, ha. *moonwalks away*

Death: HERE IS A LITTLE FACT YOU SHOULD KNOW.

Reader: You better tell me that the story is over, I can't take it anymore. 

Death: Fine. I will tell you how it ends.

(view spoiler)[Death: Everyone is gonna DIE. Now there, take this bucket. Fill it with tears. Go on, cry.

Reader: But there are still 532832 pages left! What for?

Death: Dunno.

*Random shit happens.* 
*Everyone else is bored*

Author: Dammit. I don't know how to end that fucking book. 

Papa, Mama, Liesel, Rudy, Max *all at the same time*: Please, Markus, please, just end it. We're just boring ourselves, kill us, whatever, DO SOMETHING.

Author: Mmm.. I have a brilliant idea!

*Some random bomb just blows up the whole city.* 

*Seriously.*

Death: HEY HEY, EVERYONE IS DEAD.


Liesel: Except me! But I still don't have any personality whatsoever though. So it's not like I matter or anything. Go on, ignore me. *mumbles* I'm used to it anyway. *Fades away and everyone looks for a fuck to give, but no one can find any.*

Reader: That's it? That's the grand final? Everyone just fucking dies? Hahahaha. 

Death: YOU ARE NOT SUPPOSED TO LAUGH. *jiggles empty bucket furiously*

Liesel: *goes to her dead mama* Ohh, Mama. I loved you so. You were so beautiful!

Mama: *wakes up from the dead* YOU GODDAMN PUNK ASS MOTHERFUCKING SLUT, DON'T YOU FUCKING TOUCH ME.

Reader: Hahaha! Brilliant! (That doesn't happen, though.)

Death: *seethes* How DARE you! 

Reader: Whatever. The book's over. I'm exhausted. Ciao. 

Death: *all mysterious* I will see you soon...

*Book ends. Everyone is just so fucking relieved.*

 Well I really liked this fictional story. It was very electrode buzzing, going through my brain and heart that's connected to my movement.
Yes I masterbait, but I feel as if it's a sign of respect to the author, as that he made a very... good manga. The manga was great, I look forward to more of the series, and I really liked how the graphics are just adorable.

The first time I dabbed I knew there was something more to the simple dance move than met the eye. There was something about the dab that was special. Something, dare I say, powerful.

I've done research on the matter, of course, and I've started to pick up on clues. The angle of the arm where you tuck your head (henceforth known as the "Dabbing Arm") and the aerodynamic angling of the extended opposite arm (henceforth known as "The Rudder") create a symbol of power that was once used by ancient mystics. Why these wisemen used the Dab Symbol is unknown to modern scholars and is a matter of hot debate, but I believe that early man had discovered the potential power in the dab. Over millennia, unfortunately, it appears that mankind had forgotten about the dab.

That is, ladies and gentlemen, until recently. The Dab has resurfaced, supposedly starting around Atlanta, Georgia (though that's a matter of debate in the Professional Dabbing Community), but this begs to question why? Why has dabbing returned? Could it be that there are forces at work beyond our conception pulling the strings? Perhaps a benevolent God or deity has decided that our society was ready to embrace the dab, and that through Dabbing we shall reach enlightenment. On the other hand, it's also possible that the power of Dabbing was reintroduced into society be someone meaning to sew chaos. If the sort of awesome powers that stem from dabbing could be wielded by a complete novice then who could say how much collateral damage could be taken?

I believe that dabbing is connected to the Ancient Egyptians. Think about it; when you dab your Dabbing Arm is bent at approximately a 45 degree angle. The pyramids are also triangular and are roughly 45 degree angles. Start to see connections? Madonna understood this, which is why she wrote the song "Walk Like An Egyptian". Madonna truly is one of the brightest minds of this century.

But that's not it. There's more about Egypt than most would think. Who was hiding out in Egypt, and had incredible powers? That's right, Dio Brando. Was The World a Stand brought about by mastering dabbing? Perhaps not, though images from the Speedwagon Foundation paint a very convincing picture. I'll let you be the judge.

I've almost mastered the Dab, and when I finish my studies and research my power will be absolute. No one will be able to stop me. All the fundies and roasties will feel my strength. The Chads and Staceys will cry and scream "Please, u/Piffinatour, don't kill us!" and I will proclaim "Forget Gumwaa. Have Funwaa!" as I destroy them with my concentrated Dabs. The day of retribution is nigh, brothers. Some of you are alright, don't come to school tomorrow.

You know what? It seems like the band-wagoners from 'No pineapple on pizza' are trying to fit in another way by saying ketchup shouldn't be on pasta. What are you supposed to do with Pasta and cheese? Just eat it like that? No, you need something that balances out all the heat from your freshly cooked pasta and you're certainly not going to put mayo on it. Ketchup is good on basically any solid food.

My mother knew I was going to be a Ricky and Morty fan 35 years ago just from following the career of a 9-year-old Dan Harmon. She began an arduous process of vaginal canal widening in preparation for my birth. In the last month she hobbled around around with a Sweet Sue canned whole chicken up there for 8 hours each day, and even then the doctors were on the fence about a C-section. In the last week or so she developed a technique where she literally popped her hips out of their sockets. I was born naturally with only minimal tearing. The head physiognomist from Oxford declared that my head was objectively perfect, my intelligence and character would be unparalleled regardless of upbringing, and that I might actually be evidence of fresh speciation within our race. He wrote a tear-stained letter of recommendation for me addressed to *any* future university or employer there and then, and he retired shortly afterwards after settling into a depression because his life's work was at an end.

According to this Facebook test I just took I have a real IQ of 151 and an emotional IQ of 190. I have my mother to thank for all of it.

To be fair, you have to have a very high IQ to understand Reddit. The humour is extremely subtle, and without a solid grasp of modern humour most of the jokes will go over a typical reader’s head. There’s also me_irl’s nihilistic outlook, which is deftly woven into the website’s character- it’s philosophy draws heavily from Spooky Boi literature, for instance. The Redditors understand this stuff; they have the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate the depths of these memes, to realise that they’re not just funny- they say something deep about LIFE. As a consequence people who dislike Reddit truly ARE idiots- of course they wouldn’t appreciate, for instance, the humour in Reddit’s existential catchphrase “Tbh I should just kill myself and no one would give a fuck,” which itself is a cryptic reference to my bottomless pit of existentialism 😂👌🏻👏🏻. I’m smirking right now just imagining one of those addlepated simpletons scratching their heads in confusion as Cummy’s genius wit unfolds itself on their monitors. What fools.. how I pity them. 😂

And yes, by the way, i DO have a doot doot tattoo. And no, you cannot see it. It’s for the lads’ eyes only (no homo)- and even then they have to demonstrate that they’re within 5 IQ points of my own (preferably lower) beforehand. Nothin personnel 🅱️oi 😎

Honestly this server is pretty garbage. I've been here actively for at least 24 hours now, and I have to say it's been a pretty big let down. With a server of this size I expected quality and active conversation, especially on different types of Typology; be it enneagram, MBTI, even alignments. I hate to say it but this server lacks that. It seems the userbase is mostly composed of edgelords, shitposters, and ironically unironic low IQ posters. While this would fly on 4chan, it does a disservice to the Typology community. So much so that I believe the admin would be doing us all a favor by deleting it. Now this may be funny to you guys but as an ENFJ type 8 I'm looking out for you and it's my personal responsibility to make sure you all succeed. This server serves as nothing more than an autism containment zone.

To be fair, you gotta gotz a straight-up high IQ ta KNOW Rick n' Morty. Da humour is mad subtle, n' without a solid grasp of theoretical physics most of tha jokes will go over a typical viewers head. Y'all KNOW dat shit, muthafucka! Therez also Rickz nihilistic outlook, which is deftly woven tha fuck into his characterisation- his thugged-out lil' underground philosophy draws heavily from Narodnaya Volya literature, fo' instance. Da hustlas KNOW dis stuff; they have tha intellectual capacitizzle ta truly appreciate tha depthz of these jokes, ta realise dat they not just funky- they say suttin' deep bout LIFE fo' realz. As a cold-ass lil consequence playas whoz ass dislike Rick & Morty truly ARE idiots- of course they wouldn't appreciate, fo' instance, tha humour up in Rickz existential catchphrase "Wubba Lubba Dub Dub," which itself be a cold-ass lil cryptic reference ta Turgenevs Russian epic Fathers n' Sons. I be smirkin right now just imaginin one of dem addlepated simpletons scratchin they headz up in mad drama as Don Juan Harmonz  smart-ass  wit unfoldz itself on they televizzle screens. What fools.. how tha fuck I pitizzle dem wild-ass muthafuckas. 😂
And fo'sho, by tha way, i DO gotz a Rick & Morty tattoo fo' realz. And no, you cannot peep dat shit. It aint nuthin but fo' tha ladies' eyes only- n' even then they gotta demonstrate dat they within 5 IQ pointz of mah own (preferably lower) beforehand. Y'all KNOW dat shit, muthafucka! Nothin personnel kid 😎

It's time to face the facts. Richard Stallman is nothing more than a whining, overly obese autistic manbaby who has not done anything beneficial for the computing OR technology world in the past 20 years. Seriously. Name something that RMS has done after 1995 besides bitching, crying, and moaning about bullshit that does not matter, or making some retarded, incomprehensible speech.

He demands that Linux be called GNU/Linux. That is fucking insane. The only reason GNU, GPL, and FSF are still a THING is because of Linus and the invention of Linux. If anything, Stallman should rename GNU to Linux/GNU, because without Linus, the GNU, GPL, and FSF would not be a thing anymore.

Stallman still has the fucking gonads to act like he's superior to everyone else. Saying shit such as "I'm not glad he's dead, but I'm glad he's gone" right after Steve Jobs' death. What an asshole. Stallman has not even programmed a single line of code since 2008, that was AFTER he essentially stopped in 1992. 

He should be fucking grateful Linus stepped in to save his ass, and even allowing him to take partial credit for his achievements. If it wasn't for Linus, he would be nothing, he would probably be dead in a Burger King dumpster right now.

Besides, what has he ever even done? He claims to have written eMacs, but in reality he actually cloned gosmacs (the first eMacs that was made for UNIX). He didn't even write 50% of the code in eMacs.

You might say he wrote GCC and GDB, but the truth is that he initally wrote the C compiler, but now the vast majority for the same compiler is done by contributors. 

He's a washed up, morbidly obese man who tries to stay relevant by having these retarded arguments that are similar to those found in the Soviet Union. Face it GNU/Freetards, Richard Stallman is a fat dickhead, and the only reason his name is still in the books is because of Linus's achievements.

What rights do you need to ensure exactly? helicopter parents level rights? Every1 is a already citizen and is equal under the law. That's liberalism 101. Mens rights are fighting against double standards in the law that are biased against men. (But feminism doesn't care. Those people are the patriachy. And destroying gender norms and heterosexual families will fix those problems.)
But the post modernist maxist feminism radicals are trying to corrupt it. Because not only are you equal you CANT feel/be different or don't fit in. in maxist utopia heterosexual families would be the oppressed because you cant raise a boy as a boy and a girl as a girl because its not free will. But hiding its sex(biological gender for the US) from it and let them choose their gender and encourage operations and hormone drug use on children is "free will" . We raise our kids in the image we are proud of, but if your proud of them for the sake of being proud of them. thats like getting a trophy on everyone gets a trophy day. (in your communist/marxist/"feminist" world feminism would re-emerge to fight the system again). And the pronouns are a double standard btw. entitlement.
Can you imagine a college professor having to learn 50 different pronouns for 50 different students? That's entitlement. How about books? is "they" referring to a snowflake or a group? Your oversensitive group mentality that tries to silence people who have the "wrong" views because it might hurt 1 person on earth.
Heck normal trans people don't want your snowflake pronouns. trans literally means TRANSFORMATION for a "he" to a "she". You are creating more hate than acceptance because your doing it by force. And there is no need to use force. Because each new generation is less sexist/racist than the previous ones, but now it's YOU guyz that are creating the bigots in college campuses. But you cant wait, you have to fight, rebel, be the "punks" of 2017. Fight the system. Now! 50 Years ago war was a something to fight for. Now since there is no war you fight something else.
Sex change is good! (your creating a market for the sex change industry for capitalist, you so despise, to abuse ).
Hormone injections are good ( again a new market to give your money to the capitalism hormone drug industry).
Abortion is good!(i'm 50/50 on abortion, you should have a right to abort if it harms your life, if its from rape. But NOT if its from irresponsible sex) again this funds the capitalist abortion clinics.

To be fair, you have to have a very high IQ to understand Fire Emblem. The overarching story is extremely subtle, and without a solid grasp of Norse mythology most of the plot points will go over a typical viewer’s head. There’s also the various lords' idealistic outlook, which is deftly woven into their characterisation- their personal philosophy draws heavily from Medieval literature, for instance. The fans understand this stuff; they have the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate the depths of the supports, to realise that they’re not just funny- they say something deep about LIFE. As a consequence people who dislike Fire Emblem truly ARE idiots- of course they wouldn’t appreciate, for instance, the humour in Nino's existential catchphrase “Do My Best,” which itself is a cryptic reference to the anonymously written Njáls saga. I’m smirking right now just imagining one of those addlepated simpletons scratching their heads in confusion as Intelligent System's genius wit unfolds itself on their TV screens. What fools.. how I pity them. 😂

And yes, by the way, i DO have a Fire Emblem tattoo. And no, you cannot see it. It’s for the ladies’ eyes only- and even then they have to demonstrate that they’re within 5 IQ points of my own (preferably lower) beforehand. Nothin personnel kid 😎

[Introduction, spoken]
Alright guys, *cough* I'm doing 'Take On Me' now. *says blum to the beat* Alright *says blum to the beat* I- I really- I really like this song, it sounds good

[Verse 1]
Mining away
I don't know what to mine
I'll mine this anyway
In this Minecraft day
So beautiful
Mine further down
What's that I found?

[Chorus]
Mine diamonds (Take on me)
Mine diamonds (Take on me)
I'll mine them
So far I've got two!

[Verse 2]
So easy to mine
With my Minecraft pickaxe and shovels
Hopefully they stay
In my Minecraft chests
So I'm gonna make
A lock on it

[Chorus]
Mine diamonds (Take on me)
Mine diamonds (Take on me)
I'll mine them
So far I've got two!

[Spoken]
*Multiple coughs*
I'm alright, not ready

[Verse 3]
All these diamonds
Sitting carefully lay
I'm getting worried
If they might get stolen from my ender chest
Wait who is that?
Holy sheep it's Notch!

[Chorus]
Mine diamonds (Take on me)
Mine diamonds (Take on me)
Now they're safe
*inaudible screaming*
Now...
Now that they're safe
*inaudible screaming*
Mine diamonds (Take on me)
Mine diamonds (Take on me)
[Ending, spoken]
Uh, Than- Thanks for listening guys and thanks for recommending this song

The Bagel Bakery's cream cheese tasted like butter and NANCY the waitress did not ask me how my meal was. I have never felt MORE ALONE than I did here. If my HUSBAND GERALD were still around he would knock out the owners teeth to teach them a thing or two about service.

I'm hijacking this because I'm going to try and help you fucks. 

First off, watch this entire YouTube video: https://youtu.be/Lp7E973zozc

When you wake up, try to only stay in bed 15 minutes. Set two alarms. Set a "wake up" alarm and a "get the fuck out of bed alarm.

When you get out of bed, make your bed (nicely) so you aren't tempted to crawl back in. Plus it's nice when you go to sleep and you have a made bed.

Eat your fucking bagel or your cereal. Try to make your breakfast enjoyable. Starting the day with shitty bland food will put you in a shitty bland food kind of mood.

Put your fucking shoes on and your fucking headphones on and go for a walk. I don't care if you're sick, or you can't find your right arm, just fucking do it. Aim for 30 minutes *every single day*. Sometimes you might feel like running. If you think you look weird running or skipping or what have you then it's 9am and you've already given too many fucks and it's time to stop with that. Run or skip or jump instead of caring about what that dickfuck on the other side of the street thinks of you.

If you didn't eat your breakfast before you can also eat your breakfast when you get back it doesn't make that much of a difference I just personally prefer to eat first.

The most important parts of this are making your bed and walking. Are you ready to get your shit together?

/r/getdisciplined

/r/getmotivated

When it's cold get a yoga app and a bodyweight fitness app and do that instead.

Eat your fucking vegetables. Roasted broccoli with a bit of olive oil, salt, parmesan, red pepper flakes, and black pepper is the shit. There's plenty of ways to make vegetables taste good.

/r/cooking

/r/food

/r/askculinary

Ya'll need to get your shit together. It's fucking hard I've been in your shoes before but it's fucking worth it.

Seriously we're all fucking reddit addicts. The best part about reddit is that you can curate it to be exactly what you want. Subscribe to some subreddits that are more than heaping negativity (like this one) and I guarantee you'll start reading things that will help make your life better.

And find a fucking hobby. There's a subreddit out there for you too.

in case if it was too cheap to purchase our last game, let me tell ya a bit about what happened. it was all about this abe guy that worked in this dumb meat factory called rupture farms, the place was run by glukkons and they was on the verge of going out of business. they had already chopped up all the wild creatures so now they had no choice but to chop up abe and his buddies too (abe gets scared). we gave abe the ability to talk so he can do the right thing and rescue his pals (hello. hello. follow me. okay.) but some people didnt care about doing the right thing (hello. hello. *pulls lever* *mudokon screams*) they thought it was more fun to get em all shot (*slig shoots mudokons* *slig laughs*) or ground up. (hello. hello. *abe pulls lever* *mudokon gets ground up* oops.) (i dont know *falls in a pit of mines*) or crushed (*abe runs to the lever and pulls it* *mudokon gets crushed* oops.) or even beaten (*slig beats up the poor mudokon and then laughs and beats him some more*) needless to say, this pissed some folks off and they didnt lift a finger to help abe in the end. (*slig pulls the lever and kills abe for good and the slig and the glukkon laughs then stops, then laughs again*) but if you were halfway decent about it and tried your best to save abe's buddies. (*abe frees his pals*) the end would have been much better for abe and if you'd like to see it.... you should dish out the cash and go by the stinking game (and we gotta eat too ya know)

This is a great school, all the teachers are really nice, intelligent and you can tell they all really care about the futures of their students. In addition, the school has a wide range of after school activities to choose from that will undoubtedly meet anyone’s standards. I love the spirit here at Glen Allen, and I’m proud to say that I am a Jaguar student. However, my only problem with the school is that they decided to confiscate my shield of Judas Maccabeus, my Kavacha (the armor of Karna granted by his father Surya at birth), and the Seal of Solomon (a brass ring that imprisons demons for protection purposes). This is actually quite a big issue and I need my possessions returned to me since The Awakening is now four moons overdue (about 7 fortnights). Based on my calculations I expect The Awakening to commence in approximately 2 Galactic Years (for those of you who don’t know it should be around 6.342903 x 10^28 microfortnights). 
If this information scares you, then you need to take action now! I have asked for my items to be returned to me on six separate occasions, but the school continues to send me to counseling and hold on to them. They tell me that I have nothing to fear, but I know the truth. Once Bakhtak and Sigbin descend upon the partition of the universe, the annihilation of the entire human race, and Glen Allen High School, will be eminent. In conclusion, I absolutely need my possessions back, so if you see a maroon shield with a golden eagle emblazoned on the crest, silver armor radiating an aura slightly resembling the color magenta, or a brass ring with two triangles intertwined in a juxtaposition; contact me immediately through private message on Myspace. This is extremely urgent, if we do nothing to stop this injustice happening at Glen Allen High School, we could be responsible for the destruction of the entire universe. This is why I am rating this school 3 out of 5 stars.

Oh my bad. I thought funny was like South Park or Seinfeld or George Carlin or laughing at people being triggered by transexuals. I didn't know copypasta was sought out for it's comedic value. The dudes with the freshest copypasta must get all the bitches. But my donger already burst from all the downvotes because i sexually identify as an upside down reddit post and that's my fetish. so if i copypasta i can't get the bitches. no.

Nothing is a word that means the non-existence of anything. Nothing means nothing. Nothing is a word that usually nothing uses. I broke that law by saying nothing several times in a post with the title of nothing. I am nothing. You are nothing. 99.9% of an atom is nothing. Nothing. That means everything is basically nothing because everything is made out of atoms which are basically nothing. What are you doing? Nothing. What am I? Nothing. Nothing is nothing. Non-existent. Nothing. Not a single thing. Absolutely nothing. NOTHING. I SAY NOTHING. GOT IT? NOTHING. ABSOLUTELY NOTHING!!!!! NOTHINGGGGGGGGGGG

Me: "Symmetra does not require skill"- must memorize every possible game changing tp location on every map, survive enemies baited  into turret rooms that are poorly made within 2 seconds, put up with a team that says "switch off symmetra" every game, sneak past the choke on offense to set up tp room, team comp w/symmetra acually matters, (preferably  ana + lucio, 2 tanks, and dps), whereas "aw fuck no healer, duurrr geuss ill go mercy", symmetra has to coordinate with her team to make smart plays and achieve victory, the beam has 9 meters of range so no chasing victims, and i will admit the beam has op damage at 180dps at stage 3 and each turret doing 30dps, but try killing anybody at stage 1 (ur gonna die). The only skill you need with bastion is how to set up without being raped at all angles, junkrat actually has to aim lobsided bombs, and torbjorn requires nothing but headshots.

Her: Bastion just needs to turret, anyone can do that. Symmetra is jusy placing down turrets and teleporters. I main her for defende and she really isn't much skill. Torbjorn? Turret. Done. Mercy? Mentality. Know who to fez and who not to. Carry a dumb ass team. Stay alive whilst holding down multiple buttons whilst in the air with pharah. Know how to defend yourself cause your team sure wont. Spreading the heals is hard. Squishes over tanks or tanks over squishies. Don't pocket anyone. Keep your team alive at all times. Move around the map, flying to every teammates so enemies can't hurt you. KNOW HOE TO USE THE VALKYRIE ULT. Know how to use it and how to avoid dying. I literally almost used to say mercy had no skill until somebody told me to play her. I sucked. Died a bunch. Team lost. The facy that a "bad mercy" is even a thing means that you beed skill to be a good mercy. Now? One death per game, 20,000 healing 15 elims. Skilled mercy. You try playing her. Compare yourself to a mercy main. You're a troll compared to him/her

Me:To be fair, you have to have a very high IQ to understand Mercy's skill set. The abilities are extremely difficult, and without a solid grasp of holding down a button most of the victories will go over a typical player's head. There’s also Mercy Main's pessimistic outlook, which is deftly woven into her characterisation- her personal philosophy draws heavily from Narodnaya Volya literature, for instance. The fans understand this stuff; they have the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate the depths of these skills, to realise that they’re not just difficult- they say something deep about LIFE. As a consequence people who dislike Mercy and her mains truly ARE losers- of course they wouldn’t appreciate, for instance, the humour in Mercy's existential catchphrase “HERO never die,” which itself is a cryptic reference to Turgenev’s Russian epic Fathers and Sons. I’m smirking right now just imagining one of those addlepated simpletons scratching their heads in confusion as Mercy players genius wit unfolds itself on their television screens. What fools.. how I pity them. 😂

There was once a boy. He was the son of the richest man in the universe. Mark Zuckerberg, Bill Gates, he dwarfed them all. He was a multi-trillionaire. Now, it was this boy's birthday. His father asked him,

"My son. I am the richest man in the universe. I could buy you anything you want for your birthday. A store full of lego, all the video games in the world, anything. What would you like?"

His son replied.

"Oh father. It would make me the happiest boy in the world if you could get me one pink ping pong ball."

His father was rather confused by this request. Out of all the things he could've chosen, his son chose a ping pong ball. Nonetheless, he agreed and gave him a pink ping pong ball. His son was overjoyed and spoke to him.

"My father, you have made me the happiest boy in the world. May I go up to my room and play with my pink ping pong ball?"

"Okay son, go ahead."

The boy then went up to his room and played with his pink ping pong ball. When his father went in the next morning to check on him, the boy was sleeping in his bed and the pink ping pong ball was nowhere to be found.

On the boy's next birthday, his father asked him again.

"My son. I am the richest man in the universe. I could buy you anything you want for your birthday. What would you like?"

His son replied.

"Oh father. It would make me the happiest boy in the world if you could get me one box full of pink ping pong balls."

His father was again, confused by this. Still, he bought a cardboard box and filled it with ping pong balls. He gave it to his son, who said.

"My father, you have made me the happiest boy in the world. May I go up to my room and play with my pink ping pong balls?"

The father nodded, and the son went up to his room to play. The next morning when his father went to check, the boy was sleeping peacefully and there were no pink ping pong balls in sight. Just the empty cardboard box in the middle of the room.

On the boy's next birthday, his father asked him again.

"My son. I am the richest man in the universe. I could buy you anything you want for your birthday. What would you like?"

"Oh father. It would make me the happiest boy in the world if you could get me one truck full of ping pong balls."

Now, by this point, the father was extremely confused. Why did the boy want so many pink ping pong balls and where were they going? He asked.

"My son. You are the most precious thing in the world to me and I can certainly get you this, but may I ask, why do you want a truck full of pink ping pong balls?"

His son replied.

"My father. Please humour me for a while longer. I will tell you when the time is right."

His father agreed and ordered a truck full of pink ping pong balls. The boy said.

"My father, you have made me the happiest boy in the world. May I go into the truck and spend the night playing with the pink ping pong balls?"

The father agreed and the boy spent the night in the truck. When the father went back to check on him in the morning, all the pink ping pong balls were gone, and only the boy was left, sleeping in the back of the truck.

The day before the boy's next birthday, his father asked him again.

"My son. I am the richest man in the universe. I could buy you anything you want for your birthday. What would you like?"

"Oh father. It would make me the happiest boy in the world if you could get me one oil tanker full of ping pong balls."

The father was very confused by this and had to ask again.

"My son can you tell me why you want these pink ping pong balls?"

His son replied.

"My father. Please humour me for a while longer. I will tell you when the time is right."

His father once again, agreed and bought all the ping pong ball factories in the world and made the workers work overtime to produce all the pink ping pong balls needed. He also bought an oil tanker and a pump, a crane and a dump truck to get all the ping pong balls in overnight. On his birthday, his father gave him the oil tanker full of pink ping pong balls. The boy said.

"My father, you have made me the happiest boy in the world. May I go into the oil tanker and spend the night playing with the pink ping pong balls?"

Now the father had expected this and had made sure the oil tanker was completely safe for the boy's use. He agreed and the boy went into the oil tanker for the night. The next morning, when the father went to check, all he found was his son sleeping in the ship with all the pink pong balls gone without a trace.

Now, a few days before his next birthday, the boy got into a huge car accident and was on the verge of death. His father asked him.

"My son. I am the richest man in the universe. I could buy you anything you want for your birthday. What would you like?"

The boy replied with a choked voice, obviously forcing himself to speak despite the pain.

"My father... It would make me the happiest... boy in the world... if you could get me one... pink... ping pong ball..."

His father replied.

"My son. This may be the last time I ever speak to you. Will you please tell me why you wanted all the pink ping pong balls?"

"Alright father. Come closer."

His father nodded, bringing his face up close to his son's. The son's voice was getting weak by this point, coughing in between breaths. Still, he brought up the strength for one final sentance.

"The reason I wanted all the pink ping pong balls is-"

And then he died.

Well, my high IQ does sometimes prevent me from having “normal” interactions with people. I don’t think you knuckle-dragging apes will truly understand the struggle of being intelligent though, since I am very much alike to the great minds of science and philosophy and anime.

_scoffs_

I’ve already learnt not to even go anywhere near simpletons below my IQ. As a young protegé, I was considered the “outcast” in many social gatherings, when I was truly calculating the quantum theorom and doing advanced formulas only the smart could dream of being able to solve. On the off-chance that a below 140 IQ scum does try to talk to me, they’ll immediately find it much to hard to understand, and will most likely just shrug it off and say “whatever dude” before walking off to most likely participate in simple-minded activites. It’s not just being unable to keep up with me, dumb people also emit brainwaves which interfere with my absolute genius, forcing me to lose 5 IQ points every second spent in their proximity. Fortunately, I can replenish them in no time, however I will most likely be dumbed down if I spend too much time near them. In fact, I’ve already developed, wrote and conducted 10 (yes, I find it hard to believe too, no big deal though) independent studies on the entire concept of “dumb” brainwaves. You can only comprehend them if you have a 280+ IQ like me, so for you weak-minded fools, don’t even TRY TO READ THEM!!!

_runs hand through hair_

Have I mentioned how I love Rick & Morty yet? Haha, I probably have already. If you can actually keep up with me in a normal (basically talking about standard quantum mechanics, the meaning of life and the universe) conversation, I’d probably go off on a full 10-hour long speech about R&M. Of course, like everything I watch (The Big Bang Theory, Young Sheldon, Bill Nye the Science Guy), the show is for pure intellectuals, like me. The characters and plot are so thoroughly developed, it’s like the combined genius of some of the greatest minds in history bleeding through my screen and enhancing my intellect to levels unimaginable to an unwoke human being. The humor is a plus too, I find it hard not to laugh at some of them, because I actually understand them. I’d venture a guess and say 99.9% of everyone who watches Rick & Morty don’t understand the subtle jokes and references, and therefore should be executed on the spot, in hopes that they either be reincarnated as someone that can actually contribute to society. But I’ll stop myself here, just incase I go off on a tangent about Rick & Morty. You can feel free to have an intellectual’s conversation with me though, anytime, anywhere.

_adjusts fedora_

I think that’s enough of an introduction from me.

I was the only one in my whole school who ever had acne... It was embarrassing. I had trouble looking at people when I talked to them, had a low self-esteem, and always envied the popular kids who were rich and had clear skin. I used to go to church, but seeing that I was the only one that had acne there too, I lost faith. I don't believe in god, if he were real why should we have to suffer this much with flawed skin? Creator of all good? Hm. Then who created acne to bring people to suicidal thoughts and low self-esteems? I don't feel like I deserve this, and I've prayed for many years, it's all fake.

I admit I still have issues with the way my skin looks, I still envy people with clear skin. Every where I go people have flawless skin... Everyday. I feel so alone here, and I'm hoping my scars and pimples will just go away... but one can dream, right? I've lived with this disease for over 7 years now, and I'm about to seek laser, derma-brasion, etc. treatment, because I am tired of all the false hope with antibiotics, and I'm tired of hoping my face will just get better from the regimen.

I'm sick of seeing all these people happy with their flawless skin that I deserve. They deserve my skin type. I hope someday they realize how hard it is to wake up with an ugly face every morning. Some days I just want to stay in bed and not do anything. I'm becoming anti-social from acne. My skin hurts, it's red, and it's ugly. I just want to claw at it sometimes just to make it more red. It hurts to smile... or even talk. My life between 11-now has sucked because of this hideous disease. I'm hoping when I go to college next spring that I fixed the issue...

I feel like no woman would want a man with flawed skin. I haven't had many girlfriends, and the ones I did have never complimented me or liked me as much as I did them... They cheated on me with a guy that had perfect skin. Oh, how the thought just angers me! I wish everyone had acne, or didn't so we wouldn't have to put up with this killer.

I'm done ventilating.

My meme’s are ironic
Can’t beat the first level of sonic
My depression is chronic
Relationships are purely platonic
Don’t follow gin with no tonic
Starved for attention someone please love me.
Wish I wasn’t alone
Wish I could afford a home
Seriously someone love me.

The Left is shaken that some of their own have been emailing me privately. Well, I have a message for them. You live near MILO fans. You work alongside MILO fans. We are everywhere. You’ll never know who we are. But we are watching you. We hear your conspiracy theories; we see your hypocrisy. And when the time is right we will strike. MILO can’t be beaten because MILO is an idea. A symbol of rebellion against an arrogant, clueless, self-regarding elite. Your name-calling and character assassinations only make us stronger. You have 30 years of MILO to look forward to. Strap yourselves in, darlings.

To be fair, you have to have a very high IQ to understand the live action trilogy version of Rick and Morty, entitled Back to the Future. The humor is extremely subtle, and without a solid grasp of theoretical physics most of the jokes will go over a typical viewer's head. There's also Dock's nihilistic outlook, which is deftly woven into his characterisation - his personal philosophy draws heavily from Narodnaya Volya literature, for instance. The fans understand this stuff; they have the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate the depths of these jokes, to realize that they're not just funny- they say something deep about LIFE. As a consequence people who dislike the live action version of Rick and Morty entitled Back to the future truly ARE idiots- of course they wouldn't appreciate, for instance, the humour in Docks's existencial catchphrase "Great scott," which itself is a cryptic reference to Turgenev's Russian epic Fathers and Sons I'm smirking right now just imagining one of those addlepated simpletons scratching their heads in confusion as Dan Harmon's genius unfolds itself on their television screens. What fools... how I pity them. 😂 And yes by the way, I DO have a Doc and Marty tattoo. And no, you cannot see it. It's for the traps' eyes only- And even they have to demonstrate that they're within 5 IQ points of my own (preferably lower) beforehand.

So yesterday, I fucked a dude.
It's weird. I'm not gay. I've never been into dudes, but I was browsing 4chan the other night saw one of the trap threads and I was like "Huh, these dudes look pretty close to chicks." This lead me down an internet rabbit hole that lead me to the femboys subreddit, which lead me to other parts of the internet I.E. craigslist. A dude had posted on there and he had this giant, bubble butt, that looked like a girls...like, legit. It was so big, and soft. I had him send me a KiK video to show that it was actually him...
So I met him earlier today and honestly my dudes, I'm glad. Dude could suck the rust off a trailer hitch and he let me do whatever I wanted to his ass. I oiled it up like in those ass masterpiece videos, made him twerk...it was pretty awesome.
I get this won't be a solution for everyone, because not everyone is gonna be as desperate/open as me, but it'll be an option for some...Many of them LIKE big, hairy and chubby dudes. It was pretty awesome to be found attractive by someone who had such feminine traits. Plus, there was no "aftercare", no cuddling, and no forced-conversation; we said our goodbye and he said to send him a message again if I need a release. Amazing dude.

I can't keep living like this, every day putting on this same charade. It's unbearable. Every day that I go on, I have to live with myself, and furthermore with the rest of the world, the world that makes no sense as long as The Emoji Movie exists... Every day I wake up and ponder the complexities and mysteries of that movie. I think about Gene and how he could've solved the problem within the first ten minutes of the movie and that really the plot of the movie is undermined by that simple solution, these thoughts keep me awake at night. As I lay in bed and try to sleep at night, unable to discover the beauty of slumber due to Gene's failure to grow as a character, I ponder if life is even worth continuing now that I know that the entirety of the characters presented in the Emoji movie live in a dystopian universe in which autism is promoted and normal mental stability is shunned upon. As I sit here, typing this, I reach for something, anything to bring relief and ease my pain; although, unfortunately all I find is an emoji themed notebook, a "Poop" emoji plush, my collection of official Emoji Movie collectible figurines, and my emoji themed writing utensils. I take a deep breath in. I sigh, the weight of this unbearable existence weighing me down. It feels like I can't breathe. I stand up, I walk towards the kitchen. I grab my emoji themed glass, I bend down, open the cupboard under the sink, this is where I keep my cleaning supplies. I shuffle around, searching for the right bottle. Windex, Simple Green, several loose sponges, a couple bottles of half empty dish soap. Finally I find it, the bleach. I pour a cup into my emoji cup, I gaze at the faces of the emojis that coat the cup. Smile, Joy, Crying, Poop, Devil; I begin to cry. My tears falling into the cup. I take one more deep breath in, and sigh. The weight on my chest even heavier now. "Goodbye mom and dad", I say aloud, I gaze over to their picture on my fridge. I appear to be hallucinating, as instead of my mother and father I see Mel and Mary Meh, Gene's parents in the emoji movie. I scream in terror. I drop my cup, I fall to the floor, curling into fetal position. I rock back and fourth. I begin reciting the Emoji Movie script. I can't handle being alive. I cry through the entirety of my recitation of the script. At the end, I grab the bottle of Clorox, I beg for the end to be swift, I can't bare to think of Gene anymore. I take a long and full gulp of the bitter Clorox Bleach, I await the end in writhing pain. I close my eyes, I open them again, a figure walks towards me. I close my eyes, I open them again, the figure is closer now. I close my eyes, I open them again, the figure stands over me now. I close my eyes, and I open them for the last time. Gene stands over my body, he shakes his head disappointingly, he bends down and whispers: "it's not easy being 'meh'". Everything fades away, fading towards black. I see no light of heaven, I see no flames of hell. Just black.

I see what you're saying, from that perspective it becomes apparent that we have differing views on the semiotics at hand, the way we've interpreted the definition of "contribute" seems responsible for this disconnect. By the context you provided and your logic I'd agree with you. The way I see it, if I am the first to post on something (I made my initial comment when the post was only seconds old, knowing it would likely gain momentum) because I assumed there are other people out there who dislike cheese and are subscribed to r/coolguides. My logic was that my contribution to the discussion is opening up the thread for people who dislike cheese to make further contributions based on mine, such is the way of reddit comment chains. It isn't meaningful to the subreddit, I agree 100%, if I implied otherwise it was unintentional.

And I said you "cannot downvote *according to reddiquette*" which is all the difference there. You can do whatever you want, I don't care, abuse the downvoting system or not. It doesn't really affect me, I personally advocate that the downvoting system just be amended so that it is consistent with its current form as users see fit. But until then it is there for a reason. If I'd said "you cannot downvote" well that wouldn't be a true statement, you can. That's like someone saying "you cannot murder another person according to the laws of the U.S.A." Everyone knows you can attempt to murder someone at any time, if you say "you cannot murder anyone" then you're lying. If you phrase it with the disclaimer in accordance of a statute or law you can cite, then your logic is sound, true, and justified. I specifically belabor the point and provide those disclaimers because I know if I do not then someone might come along and say otherwise.

One thing I want to say is that you claimed speaking out in defense of reddit won't work out well for me, this entire thread existing is getting my point across, much like how Socrates or Kaczynski got exactly what they wanted because to them getting their point across for the sake of humanity was all that mattered. I don't care if I personally have a million upvotes or a million downvotes on a comment. All is now at least 100 readers who had no idea reddiquette even existed and who have been using the downvote functionality incorrectly are now more aware than they were 24 hours ago. That is my goal. Out of those 100 it's safe to assume a decent percentage will go a review the reddiquette and potentially adhere to it moving forward until reddit amends it appropriately. I mentioned many of these points in replies to previous comments but the problem with abuse of the system is it impacts legitimate and potentially relevant users in a way that was not intended by the developers.

You see, when you downvote something it is meant to be a deterrent from things such as trolling or spamming, because with enough of those votes you are then limited to the amount of contributions you are able to make in a given time frame, therefore when people downvote someone they disagree with they are effectively silencing and oppressing real humans. This is not okay. I don't personally care, but a new redditor who expresses an unpopular opinion and is then downvoted might be deterred altogether from the site without understanding why they're now limited with their posts. I don't want this. I don't imagine you do either, which is likely why you said you wouldn't downvote my comment.

The only thing I'm concerned with is that a lack of adherence to the principles outlined in reddiquette directly impacts users and counter-intuitively works against the very nature of the system- people use it as a like/dislike feature. There is a reason reddit and other media sites such as FB publicly advocate against dislike features, the very logic behind this is grounded in pathos.

So it doesn't seem we're in disagreement with one another at this point. It seems, as usually is the case for me, there was a misunderstanding that could've been easily resolved if we just agreed on a definition of a "meaningful contribution" before engaging in discussion. Language is prescriptive like that, and evolves with use, not everyone has the same perspective of each word, much like the voting system of reddit, it is there for a purpose, its original form, regardless of current function. "Contribution" is defined in the OED among other places and lends itself to interpretation- but is amended appropriately over time with its use. Just like the word "conversate," which wasn't a real word for years, but over time has been amended into the OED because of its widespread popularity and use. Just like hopefully not too far into the future reddit will just amend their reddiquette link to state that you can downvote people if you disagree with them.

But that doesn't solve the issue of downvoting out of disagreement effectively silencing users and impacting them negatively as a result. So the policy prescription I propose is a four way voting system. The top and bottom arrows can be used as they currently are intended, for relevancy and contributions. The left to right arrows can be used to express likeness or dislike. That way people can negatively sidevote you all they want without it affecting your ability to communicate with them. I have much more to say on this and for years I've posted this ever since reddit gained in popularity and with it came the abuse of the system, I'm sure you- as another fellow redditor from the olden times when it somehow looked even more archaic- noticed as well.

As for the edit, my comment was trending downward long before the edit. I have no idea if the majority of my downvotes came from that or not, as it is irrelevant, since they shouldn't have been inspired by either.

It's funny, context is everything. Every other day it seems on various accounts I'm writing these same comments in regards to the system, usually in defense of others who've been victim of abuse of the system, and every other day they are downvoted into oblivion or gilded and top comment material. Illustrates the hivemind mentality quite well.

While most people laughed at the "pickle rick" scene in Season 3 of the Rick and Morty TV series, few people actually **understood** it. Me, on the other hand, with my 200 IQ (that's right, my IQ is **200**), am fully equipped with the mental tools needed to dissect the "pickle rick" scene in time to chuckle whilst watching it occur. No, I did not have to pick apart and analyze the scene, watching it over and over again, to understand the scene's *true* meaning. In fact, I knew Rick would be in pickle form immediately when Morty walked into the garage. BAM! Just like that, my brain calculated why the scene was funny and the *true* joke that was intended. Most people know very little about history, it's unfortunate, but that's just how it is nowadays. What, with the education system being so bad. Ahahaha. Dummies. No offense, you guys are just retarded. I mean, it's not like I'm trying to insult you, but you were just raised this way. Raised to be inferior to me. Do not fret, I hold you in **ABSOLUTELY** no contempt. Let's get back to the meat of the argument. So, history lesson, there was once a philosopher called Aristotle. He was like Plato, but more practical. Oh, and Plato, he was a philosopher too. Philosophers are people who think about the world. Do you know what that means? To think about the world? I wonder if you can. I truly do, do not worry pleb, this is mere constructive criticism, it is not intended as an insult towards you. You being inferior is **OKAY**, it is okay that you are inferior, not everyone can be as intelligent as me. Aside from my education (I'm a Harvard graduate, FYI), I was born with a 200 IQ. I wonder if you can even remember having read that I was born with a 200 IQ or if it's already exited your little brain. **ANYWAYS**, so, now we have established the concept of philosophers in your little pea brain. Philosophers = people who think about things. So, Plato, Aristotle. Both philosophers from the Roman Empire. Let's move forward in time a bit, yes, yes, let's move ALL THE WAY INTO THE 19th/20th century! So here we are. There's a hip new philosopher whose name is Nietzsche. So, if you've ever read Nietzsche you'll know he's a nihilist. Nihilism means "the world has no purpose", essentially. Nietzsche believed the world had no purpose. I have studied him for 10 years now at Princeton, it's such a nice school! I've had sex with tons of women during my stay there, women at places like that are attracted to big brain guys like me. It's just how it is, sorry chap. **SO** nihilism = no meaning in the world. This was groundbreaking for the time, prior to this, religion had ruled over the world. Christianity had dominated Europe, and everyone was obsessed with "meaning", ba! "meaning", what is that!? Hahahahaha, what a absolutely bizarre concept. Unfortunately, before Nietzsche could finish his philosophy he died of an STD, how dreadful! This was one of the single most troublesome things I had ever discovered in my life, second only to the fact that there are others out there with 201 IQs. Probably lying, probably cheated on their tests. Do you remember that we were talking about Rick and Morty pleb? Well, anyways, the "pickle rick" scene is what I consider to be the culmination of Nietzsche's work. I laughed, I laughed so hard at that scene because I was so happy, and I laughed because I realized how pointless the culmination of Nietzsche's work was anyways. Why had that concerned me so? Why had I cared so much about Nietzsche's work? The world truly has no meaning, few can actually come to this realization, but I did. If you had an IQ of **200**, maybe you would too! Ahahahahahahahahahahahahahaahahaha. Ah, I love a good joke!

When I was fifteen, I read The Intelligent Investor and it changed my life. From that point on, I KNEW that Wall Street was for me. My mind was blown by the variety of financial products the wizards of Wall Street could bake up. I studied more. CDOs, CDSs, butterfly options, you name it, I read about it. A year later, despite not having the best academic record, I was humbled to be accepted into Wharton. This was when I knew my hard work and dedication were beginning to pay off. I focused in school and networked HARD with elite Wall Streeters. This was MY time. Staying up late at nights building LBO models. Skipping class to watch IPOs on CNBC. Well friends, I'm deeply and truly humbled that it's all finally paid off and I've accepted an offer as an investment banking intern at Goldman Sachs! I'm so grateful for all the support from friends and family along the way, it means a lot to me and I couldn't have done it without you. I can't wait to see what my future brings and I want to share it with all of you. New York City here I come!

I was feeling curious, and a little bit horny

So I put on a diaper, one tailored just for me

I got some mascara to make my eyelashes big

And I dusted off my old horse dildo rig

It was a mechanical marvel, fit for a king

It was a large, throbbing finger and my ass was the ring

So I poked a hole in my pampers and prepared to sit right down

When in walks my dad with a great big frown

this dude literally came up to me and bragged about how he has a job at a expensive restaurant and I was like dude some people would probably like to have a slice of bread at the end of the day but don't and that's because of jerks in the industry like you. so I shoved him and he got red hot and told me i don't have no authority and I probably work a dead end job making minimum wage and so I raised my fist said look we can do this the easy way or we can do this my way and he was scared I could tell by the look in his eyes. he backed up and I threw a punch but then he got so mad he screamed at me and I could see him tearing up so I laughed and then the staff of my gym who I known for years tell me to leave before they call the cops and I'm straight edge I don't back down. so I argue with the cops and I get banned from the gym. anyways I'm suing them for taking my money for my gym membership and failing to deal with the situation. let this be a lesson to you fellow body builders and muscle pumping extraordinaires don't take anything with the weight of a feather...

My mother knew I was going to be a Rick and Morty fan 35 years ago just from following the career of a 9-year-old Dan Harmon. She began an arduous process of vaginal canal widening in preparation for my birth. In the last month she hobbled around around with a Sweet Sue canned whole chicken up there for 8 hours each day, and even then the doctors were on the fence about a C-section. In the last week or so she developed a technique where she literally popped her hips out of their sockets. I was born naturally with only minimal tearing. The head physiognomist from Oxford declared that my head was objectively perfect, my intelligence and character would be unparalleled regardless of upbringing, and that I might actually be evidence of fresh speciation within our race. He wrote a tear-stained letter of recommendation for me addressed to any future university or employer there and then, and he retired shortly afterwards after settling into a depression because his life's work was at an end.

According to this Facebook test I just took I have a real IQ of 151 and an emotional IQ of 190. I have my mother to thank for all of it.

First off forgive the grammar. I'm typing this through a lapto with a covere dscreen. 

That's how hardcore I am. In fact, I don't even look at computer screens anymore as it induces "third reality" syndrome.  Something I made up, basically it sucsk you into third reality/cybperspace.

This has been the best week and a half I've had in a long long long time. It's been hard but I have to tell you the benfits are coming in slowly. 

I am 30 years old and I have quit internet, media, television and radio for 9 days now.  I am more productive, alert, and my anxiety has diminished.

In fact, I have decided, and have linked my anxiety issues to internet use. I have bene using the intneret since I was 15 year.. no.. 11 years old. Since 1996. So roughly, I have been online or about 20 years. I have also had lifelong  anxiety and deression. It hit hardest late 20's. I have linked this all to internet use. 

You might ask yourself.... well "What if I check my email?" -
 NOPE. What if I go on for 10 minutes. NOPE.
I'm fucking serious dude.. if ou're going to do this you hvae to jump all in. Now, don't get me wrong, I listen to music when I workout off youtube.. and I have checked my email maybe like 5 times in the past 7 days.. no doubt. But I make it quick and Get the fuck off. TRUST ME. THATS HOW BAD THIS SHIT IS.

Internet is like poison for ou rin mind.. I am serious. 

SO get the fuck off of it after ou you read this and make an oathe. to quit all stimulation.. video games, internet.. TV, EVERYTHING. How bad do you want to have a AWESOME life??

There is no fucking doubt about it in my mind that my depresison anxiety and other issues were from using the internet. I don't have a theory or scientific facts, I just know this is the truth. 

I have 36 replies to my other posts in my inbox as we speak, but I haven't even read them, th emain reason is because, it will illicit emotional respones and trigger dopamine that will send me on a chain of prolognged use for the night. 

In other words, I know that everyone on here are human beings, but I have taken an o internet policy, and have said god bye to cyber space. I suppose I am typing this because I want the messaage to get out there.

QUIT THE INTERNET NOW.

The benefits are numerous.. 

I wgo to bed at night, .. dead tired, unexplainably, no reason. I quit all forms of media, internet, television, radio, this means quit everything. IF you can't do it, than you will not receive the benefits. When you quiet the mind and silence all forms of distraction you begin to see a new life. In other words, your spirit is open for the first time, befcause it is not clouded with all the bullshit.. that is being shoved down our throats from day 1.

If you grew up on TV like most american kids, than you are born addicted. When you grow up on internet, even worse. I find myself talking oenly a out of nowhere, and strangely, I spent so much time with family went to a BBQ, was completely extrovert, hung out with friends and family and had zero anxiety.. My libido has jumped back... Also some days I just have edtra thougth energy etc.

I know that this shit is for real because I ha d a few nights, where I had some type of strange withdrawl syndrome, symptoms.. My head was pounding and I was suffering. But I knew it was because my mind was fineding for stimulation. I quit e TV, radio, and internet. I don't play video games. I am done poisoning my mind with bullshit clutter.

Most of you will say, "That's too te extreme" - to which I reply.. how bad do you want to enjoy every moment of your life? and be present all the time? ..?

My anxiety is diminishing finally and it feels great. I am not a social dynamo but I am slowly rinsing the fera out of my soul.

My theory si we tax our dopamine system with internet, television, radio so much, that it just get sout o hand.. I also think that..

it was the reason I stayed up so late. I've been going to bed at night every night like clockwork and getting up early in the morning.. as soon I get u in the morning..

I already have ap lan for the day, like instantly in my head I know what to do.. it's weird. can't explain it. Like the.. intuitively or somthing.I don't know.

So you may be wondering.. Dude are you serious? What do I do when it's the afternoon and I am hoe at night?

STARE AT THE FUCKING WALL. YEP. THATS RIGHT I SAID IT. 

STARE AT THE FUCKING WALL. OR TALK TO a friend. 

I noticed that at night I get the urge to watch TV or Go on the internet or some other bullshit and instead I would just stare at the fucking wall. or read a book. sometimes od nothing. YOU HAVE TO DO IT. The void is waiting fo rou.

Once you go into the void.. that's when th ebrain heals. The silence is what cure syou.

The age old saying, Silence is golden was for a reason. Heal your ps spirit. Heal your soul. 

It's  feels like suffering at firs,t but another trippy thing is you start to have flashbacks and memoreis of being younger

and you stasart to appreciating small thigns in life. 

I usually just think of a good book to read or look fo  for magazines or something. I allosw myself non-internet non tv  non video game things. Do it. 

Just pretend like you lived in the 1800s. END OF GAME.  what would you do? 

DO IT NOW.

do it forever. 
I go to sleep early at night and get up early in the morning automatically.. then I Realied thi sis how we were designed because..

in the old days, we didn't have Tv, radio, internet.. and even ilghts to keep ups up and distracteda all night.. unless you went to a saloon or something, so it makes sense. 

I think that's about it for now. I know this is the step in the right direction it's opening my mind and spirit to appreciating whta truly matters in life. I also have bene more cereative.. I cook a lot and I also started doing artwork again.. I havn't done art in like 8 years.. Never had the motivation.. 

My theory si that.. when you finally allow your brain to be bored and suffer.. Yes you will suffer.. you will be bored.. but if you tought through the boredom of the intern.. of not having any stimulation.. you will begin to heal finally.

Also. I allowed orgasm in my life again. I fell for the whole nofap bullshit and thoght that's what I needed.

The truth in my opinion is that.. the benefits of nofap are all pl.. BULLSHIT.. it was all internet and distraction... The benefits people talk about on nofap. I am getting from being free of all internet stimulation and Tv.. 

..And I get it all because my mind is clear etc. So basically what I am trying ot sya is that.. Nofap is fucking bullshit.

I have ejaulated.. Like 6 time sthis week. Through natural ways of course. I purposely masturbated 3 times in a row .. BOOM I had energy, ran   2 miles. In fact the days that I ejeaculate I have the most energy. 

So the NOFAP movement is fucking bullshit, full of lies, nd psuedo scienec.

They may be onto something when they talk about dopamine.. but that's about it. Clear your mind. Free your spirit. Don't be pkugged into the matrix like 90% of Americans with their assholes on their smart phones. That littl ebit of distraction, checking your email, facebook, reading the news.. it's al bullshit. It kills your spirit, ; don't believe me, then suffer the consequences and never reap the benefits. Or try it yourself.

You will have withdrawls you will be o bored out of your mind.. but go for a walk.. 

How did I do it? I jacked off.

When nights got bad, or when I get extremely bored, I would jack off. I'm sort of doing this thing where I have a theory based off of Ivar123's post which basically says masturbating gives you energy.. sort of oes.. when not done too frequently.

What else.. Hmm.

When I did nofap, I was supplementing dopamine in other ways like alcohl, internet surfing, fod etc. In fact, nofap made my life worse, and made me very unhappy for about 3 years.. so FUCK nofap. In fact, I fucking hate nofap and athe stupid cult behind it. I decideed I will write about it no wfor the remainder of my time..

Nofap is bullshit, never worked. In fact, it was THE INTERNET addiction that I needed to cure.. My addiction to Internet, television, radio, media, that swhat keeps you from going forwward in life. Video games. Our society LIVES on this shit.. we are all plugged into the matrix. 

Will you discover your own soul? It's up to you to find out.

So I finally said Fuck no fap, and told myself.. I will use masturbation to ween myself off of all of my other addictions. My theory has worked. So far, I allow myself to masturbate, every so often.. I've been masut masturbating t .. her.. masturbating about every 3 dyas. 


NO SIDE  EFFECTS AT ALL. OF COURSE I DONT DO IT TO ORN. - GEE.. So I allowed myself to masturbate like every 5 days.. and or every 3 days, and told myself..

NO ALCOHOL, TV, INTERNET, or ANYT  OTHER STIMULATION. 

If I get bored.. I can read a book. And if things get really bad, I'll jack off. So far I've jacked off.. 7 times and ejaculated 7 times in the past 11 days. But I have absolutely NOT used any internet, tv, radio, porn, video games, or any of that shit.

THAT IS WHAT REALLY DRAINS US. 
also 

reading bad things like BAD news papers etc. 

Guess what? I feel better than I have in a long fucking time.. I'ms tarting to feel normal again. But don't believe me? try it yourself. 

QUIT THE INTERNET

QUIT VIDEO GAMES

QUIT TV

QUIT WATCHING MOVIES

DO IT NOW

YES I FUCKING SAID IT

What? You can't watch a movie with your GF? 

NO YOU CANT and if someone is watcing TV go in the other troom

How bad do you want a great life? 

How bad do you want a clear mind and spirit?
How bad do you want to be happy most of the time?

Dont believe me? 

Than try it.

Let your brain heal you will find out.

Then once you heal I believe you can try nofap For real this time and see what happens.

Of course I would like that. I'd love shoving my tiny dick up your big fat ass. Oh! I could hear the sound of cum juice squealing from your anus, the pressure of cum oozing out of your asshole.. I could feel my dick sliding through your tiny brain. I could see the color of your anus; purple. You like the color purple, don't you? I can infect my balls with bluewaffles and purple(fy) my dick just to make you eat it like a cupcake, a blueberry cupcake.. your favorite. You want me to eat a dick? No. I don't eat dicks. I eat little faggots. Eat them for breakfast, lunch, and dinner. You're a faggot, would love tasting your blood - your cold, icy, blood.﻿

As if anime isn't already bad enough by itself, now you motherfuckers are getting into a little something called traps.  
Basically, it's a dude that dresses like a chick, has a dick, and you say isn't gay.  
Well I'm here to tell you IT'S FUCKING GAY.  
If I walked up to you right fucking now, me being a dude and you being a dude, and you got turned on by me, that would be gay.  
It's no different for fucking traps.  
Just cause they dress like a chick doesn't mean they are a chick, they got a dick and IT'S GAY.  
AND DON'T SAY THE DICK MAKES IT CUTER.  
THAT DOESN'T MAKE IT CUTER, IT MAKES IT EVEN GAYER.  YOU'RE GAY, BITCH.  
AND YOU SEND ME PICTURES WITH THEIR FUCKING SKIRTS UP AND THEIR NUTS HANGING DOWN.   
I DON'T WANNA SEE THAT. I'M NOT GAY LIKE YOU.  
STOP SENDING ME HENTAI. STOP SENDING ME ANIME. STOP SENDING ME TRAPS.      
 OH MY GOD.

a few months ago i tripped on 3 tabs of lsd, and i listened to old school west coast rap, and older atlanta trap rap. some of the main artists i listened to was gucci mane, warren g, ti, young jeezy, nwa, and snoop. a lot of the songs i listened to were about trapping and selling coke, and i felt immersed in that world during my trip. after the trip i was normal, but as the weeks passed by i noticed i was thinking different. i have a voice in the back of my head saying, "push these bricks my nigga", or something alomg those lines. i dont sell drugs and i never have, but i think listening to all this rap music on acid is making me think different. all i can think about now is hustling and staying trill. does anybody have advice on this?

I just don't get it, in nature, in the cave (when we were cavemen) there were NO DOORS. I never close the door when I take a shit. Some people just stare when I'm taking a shit in my uni but I just look back at them. I don't think people actually really mind, so why do people poop with the door closed?

If you haven't noticed Star Wars is political commentary that mirrors current political situations of the time. The current trilogy is mirroring what's happening now in America where the military industrial complex/shadow government or what ever you want to call it is taking over the country. The First Order is a military presence that infiltratated the senate and successfully split the galaxy in two. Original Trilogy was Vietnam, Prequels were similar to now but in the time of the Bush admin. It's the same situation people behind scenes paying terrorists to attack a planet and then play the victim using reactionaries to convince the galaxy to go to war while secretly controlling both sides of the war. The force awakens title is very Meta. They know people are awakening to the real ways of the world. It makes perfect sense for Finn to realize how that he was actually on the bad guys side the first time he got to see it first hand.

It depends on the rock. More clastic sedimentary rocks like your breccia or various coarse grained sandstones may leave some serious scarring in the vaginal tissue. Other more smooth to fine grained sediments likes chert or various forms of shale might actually not be that harmful to the inner lining. My personal favorite is a nice chunk of bituminous coal. While I don't have a vagina, I do frequently insert these into my rectum so I assume it would have the same effect. While inside me I like to clench down on my earthen buttplug nice and hard, pretending im a mountain pressurizing the coal lump, forcing it to undergo metamorphism and eventually take shape into a beautiful diamond. Some of the things I've been able to form so far are honestly quite majestic and have earned me the nickname "human rock tumbler" here in my local gay community. If your interested in buying from my collection of butt polished garnets and sapphires just send me a PM ;)

The amount of casual fuckboys here who are willingly on the side of big business just going "Fucking hurr durrrr it's their right to close 'underperforming divisions' hurr durr" is seriously, probably the most disgustingly pathetic thing I've ever seen on this sub and I've seen some shit.  

Are you that daft? They "underperformed" so fuck the fuckers, get rid of them? Simple as that, huh? The .xls said they need to be axed so get rid of them, because the numbers don't lie. Forget the corporate behaviors that caused this problem, right?  


Are you FUCKING serious? Dead Space was a niche franchise. It sold VERY WELL for a brand new IP in the "survival horror" genre. Very, very well. Dead Space 2 sold AT LEAST 4 million copies. Probably way more - considering 1.6 million of those are on Steam alone and that doesn't include 360, PS3, Xbox One back compatibility, or Origin  .

They did not underperform. They made money on Dead Space 1 and 2. They simply didn't make $237587235 which is what EA wants. When your expectations and your budget is based entirely on a fantasy world, every studio underperforms. You cannot release a game that has this specific of an audience and then table flip when it has "only" sold 4 million copies within 6 years. That's ludicrous, unrealistic, and ignorant, in comparison to a game like Resident Evil 4, 5, or 6, all of which have sold at least 7.5 million, and RE4 is over 10 years old. By 2007 and 4 releases including Wii, RE4 had still only sold 1.7 million copies. It takes fucking time.  

Do you know why it eventually sold that many copies? Because it's been re-released 9 times. GC, PS2, PC, Wii, PS3, PS4, 360, XB1, PC again, and, it was included in RE6 archvies/anthology version.  

Do you know why RE5 sold that many copies? Because it's been re-released. PS3, PS4, 360, XB1, PC and again, and, it was included in RE6 archvies/anthology version.  

Do you know why RE6 sold so many copies? Because it's been re-released. PS3, PS4, 360, XB1, PC.  

Dead Space trilogy was released one time - 360, PS3, PC. Dead Space 3 on PC was exclusive to Origin, and 2 on Steam does not have the DLC available.  

No fucking shit # 2 only sold "4 million" copies.  

EA completely mismanaged this studio and drove them into the ground, the same way they do with their acquired 3rd party studios. They had completely unrealistic expectations for DS2 and 3, proving they have no comprehension of the games they are making and are only interested in money.  

Do you honestly think any of their other studios get treated this way, assuming EA actually had any other first party studios still open that aren't EA Sports, and actually do anything? (Hint: They don't.) Don't get me wrong - they operate 37 different studios/offices. 3 of them are BioWare, another 3 of them are another developer, 2 of them are EA Sports, etc. But they also don't actually make anything, who knows why, and I bet if they didn't have 28 other needless studios, they might see higher profit margins.  

If you defend this and just say "It's within their right and it's expected to shut down underpeforming studios" you have no fucking idea what you're talking about, no comprehension of why anyone is upset, and you need to shut the fuck up because spewing your uneducated opinion means nothing to anyone.  

You can't fathom why anyone is pissed off, huh? It's eluding you? Not one possible reason huh?  

Dead Space is done. It will never come back. There will never be a plot resolution to $200 and at least 120 hours of millions of people's gaming lives.The first Star Wars game with any chance of being worth a fuck since 2008 just got its developer closed and it's changing hands to some devs no one knows shit about, because EA didn't like the way it was going. That almost certainly equates to - it wasn't casual and filled with shitty microtransactions enough for the corporate stooges. It was a single-player, story based game with finite - if any- opportunities to continually milk customers for a long term revenue stream.EA is literally famous for destroying the gaming industry. There are so many articles and websites dedicated to just how much ruin they've left in their wake. They are the Donald Trump of the gaming industry. Yea, sure they may not be 1980s Atari famous, but if another game industry crash does happen, I bet you money it will be EA driving the bus.Not all of us are 8. EA destroyed our favorite game developers and franchises from our childhood. Command and Conquer, Populous, SimCity, ThemePark, ThemeHospital, Burnout, Mercenaries, Dead Space, these are all relics now because of EA. They also are holding hostage Dungeon Keeper, Crusader, Wing Commander, Ultima, and lots of other IPs.Many more IPs have sat stagnant for decades and almost disappeared because of their bullshit. System Shock is the most prominent example - it was locked up in legal limbo for almost 2 decades because EA didn't own all the rights - some stupid legal firm owned part of them - and neither was willing to let them go. It is only by the graces of Night Dive and CDP that System Shock 3 is finally happening and System Shock remake is coming out - crowdfunded by the way.Star Wars, again. EA had a hand in LucasArts demise and has now taken on the Star Wars mantle, through their exclusivity deal with Disney to be the only developer allowed to make Star Wars games. And so far they've totally fucked it up. Battlefront 1 and 2 are both shit, and the only other game they released was a mobile game.  

So yea, there is MORE than enough reason to be physically ill about EA.

An earthworm is a tube-shaped, segmented worm found in the phylum Annelida. Earthworms are commonly found living in soil, feeding on live and dead organic matter. An earthworm's digestive system runs through the length of its body. It conducts respiration through its skin. It has a double transport system composed of coelomic fluid that moves within the fluid-filled coelom and a simple, closed blood circulatory system. It has a central and a peripheral nervous system. The central nervous system consists of two ganglia above the mouth, one on either side, connected to a nerve cord running back along its length to motor neurons and sensory cells in each segment. Large numbers of chemoreceptors are concentrated near its mouth. Circumferential and longitudinal muscles on the periphery of each segment enable the worm to move. Similar sets of muscles line the gut, and their actions move the digesting food toward the worm's anus.

Earthworms are hermaphrodites–each individual carries both male and female sex organs. They lack either an internal skeleton or exoskeleton, but maintain their structure with fluid-filled coelom chambers that function as a hydrostatic skeleton.

"Earthworm" is the common name for the largest members of Oligochaeta (which is either a class or a subclass depending on the author). In classical systems, they were placed in the order Opisthopora, on the basis of the male pores opening posterior to the female pores, though the internal male segments are anterior to the female. Theoretical cladistic studies have placed them, instead, in the suborder Lumbricina of the order Haplotaxida, but this may again soon change. Folk names for the earthworm include "dew-worm", "rainworm", "night crawler", and "angleworm" (due to its use as fishing bait).

Larger terrestrial earthworms are also called megadriles (which translates to "big worms"), as opposed to the microdriles ("small worms") in the semiaquatic families Tubificidae, Lumbricidae, and Enchytraeidae, among others. The megadriles are characterized by having a distinct clitellum (which is more extensive than that of microdriles) and a vascular system with true capillaries.

Earthworms are far less abundant in disturbed environments and are typically active only if water is present.

Pikachu (Japanese: ピカチュウ Hepburn: Pikachū) (/ˈpiːkətʃuː/; [pikatɕɯː]) are a species of Pokémon, fictional creatures that appear in an assortment of video games, animated television shows and movies, trading card games, and comic books licensed by The Pokémon Company, a Japanese corporation.

The Pikachu design was conceived by Atsuko Nishida and finalized by Ken Sugimori. Pikachu first appeared in Pokémon Red and Green in Japan, and later in the first internationally released Pokémon video games, Pokémon Red and Blue, for the original Game Boy.

Like other species of Pokémon, Pikachu are often captured and groomed by humans to fight other Pokémon for sport. Pikachu are one of the most well-known varieties of Pokémon, largely because a Pikachu is a central character in the Pokémon anime series. Pikachu is regarded as a major character of the Pokémon franchise as well as its mascot, and has become an icon of Japanese pop culture in recent years. It is also seen as one of the major mascots for Nintendo.

So first to clear things up, I'm a teenage girl (not a guy, not gay) and have a strong crush on 23-year old Iosif Stalin. I mean, he is smoking hot. Is it just me or do other people also think that way? All my friends disagree when I show them his photo and ask whether he is hot. I almost feel like I'm in love with this guy, and it just depresses me that he died a long time ago (64 years already!), and it's been 116 years since he was 23. When I had crush on other guys I always had a hope that maybe at one point I'll talk to them, but in this case that's completely impossible which makes me sad. Sometimes when I try to sleep I suddenly think of his face and it just stays there for a long time before I actually fall asleep. During the day I occasionally find myself trying to picture him in real life. It's almost scary because I basically have a crush on a dead person. What should I do about this?

A few years ago I was sitting at my computer watching Mythbusters (S07E05) when I decided to Wank. So I paused my episode, opened a new window, got some weird fetish stuff, And started jerking it. A short while later I finished (likely into a t-shirt) and closed down my window of porn revealing Jamie Hyneman in a wetsuit on the netflix page behind. Just then my mom burst in to collect landry and saw me cock in hand and Jamie on the Screen. she screamed and closed the door abruptly, we didn't speak for the rest of the afternoon. To this day I can't watch mythbusters with my family, but having the choice, I much prefer my mom thinking I was fapping to mythbusters than japanese bondage enemas.

Real Men sew without a thimble. Real Men have thick skin. They take their Gym Shirts torn from all of the extreme bodybuilding and muscle mass. Take an Extra Sharp Needle and Heavy Duty Thread (No other thread can handle the manliness), and thread it into the shirt. They can poke their finger but they don't care. God gave us 3 layers of skin for a reason. For all Real Men care they can stick the needle through their nail and shove a pin up their ass while they fuck their lady hard. No tears, tears are for betas. They take the needle and poke their flesh until a drop of manly blood comes out, that is a proof of true Manliness. Real Men don't care, just keep on sewing. The shirt will soak it up like it does with the manly gym sweat. 

And don't you say "Real Men don't sew at all". If you think using a thin knife to poke a fabric to inject a string like a tattoo is not manly, you are a pansy. Real Men sew all their girls' shirts and panties shut and their bra cups together so she will have no choice but to make his sandwich naked. A True Man can be valued by the number of scars on his fingertips. A TRUE MAN SEWS WITHOUT A THIMBLE!!!

potential locker room issue: do you think NBA players seeing each others penises in the showers in the locker rooms?

was just wondering if this was an issue - seems like a potential ethic's issue - what if a point guard starts passing fewer times to a certain player because he see the players penis in the locker room ? could hurt feelings of smaller not well endowed nba players...

do they see the penis in the shower?

as a parent - I am concerned that my 19 year old son (he has a micro penis.) is looking up to grown men who gaze at other men's penises in locker rooms. are the players in the Nba team seggregated by size of cock? 

I dont want my sons confidence shattered because other men with penises look at other mens gentalia in the Nba setting.

did talented Nba players like Michael jordan do this ?

I saw the leader of 4chan at a grocery store in Los Angeles yesterday. I told him how cool it was to meet him in person, but I didn’t want to be a douche and bother him and ask him for photos or anything.
He said, “Oh, like you’re doing now?”
I was taken aback, and all I could say was “Huh?” but he kept cutting me off and going “huh? huh? huh?” and closing his hand shut in front of my face. I walked away and continued with my shopping, and I heard him chuckle as I walked off. When I came to pay for my stuff up front I saw him trying to walk out the doors with like fifteen Milky Ways in his hands without paying.
The girl at the counter was very nice about it and professional, and was like “Sir, you need to pay for those first.” At first he kept pretending to be tired and not hear her, but eventually turned back around and brought them to the counter.
When she took one of the bars and started scanning it multiple times, he stopped her and told her to scan them each individually “to prevent any electrical interference,” and then turned around and winked at me. I don’t even think that’s a word. After she scanned each bar and put them in a bag and started to say the price, he kept interrupting her by yawning really loudly.

**TL:DR now taking interviews for local televisions at their behest to get to the bottom of this 4chan chanspiracy. **

I did an experiment my first year of college trying to figure out exactly what the most pleasurable non sexual experience was.

I initially started out setting my alarm at 3 in the morning so that I could experience the pleasant feeling of being able to go back to sleep after being woken up in the middle of the night. Did it for about 2 weeks but quit because it made me so tired during the day. Would not recommend 3/10
The second thing I tried was sneezing. I induced sneezing with ground pepper and other aerosolized powders and while it was pleasant (I sneeze very hard) my skin on the inside of my nose got super irritated and it hurt to breath after about 3 days of inducing sneezing every 2 hours. Would certainly not recommend 2/10

The third thing I tried was scratching an itch. I am mildly allergic to mosquitoes and where I went to college had swarms of them around sunset so I stripped down to my underwear and stood out at dusk for 2 hours and got well over a hundred bites. I then set a 7 minute timer and would scratch my whole body for 15 seconds but only at 7 minute intervals. I was a disgusting bloody mess, what wasn't bloody had the clear sticky plasma fluid that got stuck to my clothes and hurt when it would rip off. But it was very rewarding and was very pleasurable during those 15 seconds of glory. Would kinda recommend 6/10

The next thing I did was the pleasure of eating when being very hungry. (Old saying in Spanish saying that hunger is the best cook) I decided to fast for 6 days and eat the 7th day, Sunday to Friday fast, Saturday have BREAKFAST (Pun very much intended). I had a miserable first couple of days, but Thursday and Friday I felt really good, had a test on Friday felt clearheaded had good energy it was a really great experience. Saturday rolled around, I went to the cafe got a big plate of French toast, tater tots the works and sat down to eat... It was remarkable unsatisfactory, didn't feel all that hungry, the food taste was overwhelmingly sweet, and maybe four or five bites in I felt soooooo full. It was a great experience to fast but did not provide a pleasurable sensation. Would not recommend to pleasure speakers but it was a surreal experience, so 7/10

2 weeks after I attempted to do the exact opposite, the pleasure of voiding after having a lot in the bowel. I am a vegetarian so I usually consume a lot of fiber but noted that when the stool was a little firmer I really enjoyed pooping. So I decided to hold my shit for as long as possible and consume very little fiber. I went without pooping for 4 days and what followed has had to have been one of the most painful experiences of my life. I sat on the toilet for well over an hour just pushing what seemed to be a giant rock hard megaphone seemingly getting wider the more I pushed. I thought just crowning was bad, but the worst was after an inch pushed out my sphincter couldn't close again and it remained stretched out for the remainder of the log. It felt like I had a burning hot metal rod up my ass, after some research i learned its called "the ring of fire." I did learn the most effective way of pushing out solid shits is to bend over so your chest is on your knees and begin to push while righting your back up strait, it winches the shit out, one painful fucking millimeter at a time. Would not wish on my worst enemy, this one was really bad 0/10.

The last one was the pleasure of peeing after holding it in. I remember as a child having the most pleasant dealings after a long car ride or when I peed myself. Let's start with the fuck up, I decided to do this during finals week, I started on Monday night and held it no problem till Tuesday night, stayed up late studying for my history final and ended up falling asleep and waking up 5 minutes after the exam, rushed out hadn't quite processed the fact that I needed to pee (was planning on peeing before the test). It was a long form essay test and i could not keep still, no amount of moving, fidgeting, and grinding down on my pen could distract me from the fact that I NEEDED TO PEE. About 30 minutes in I waddled to the teacher and begged her to let me go to the bathroom but she refused saying I could be cheating. I ran to my seat wrote the fasted 5 pages in my life and an agonizing 20 minutes later I ran, hand clamped on my foreskin, the 200 ft to the bathroom and in the half a second it took to let go of my foreskin and pull down my pants, started pissing all over the place but managed to aim and reach the urinal the final ten feet of shuffling with my pant around my ankles. I nearly melted on the floor the feeling was beyond orgasmic, I was slouched over the divider with my bare ass out and peed for well over a minute. I think a few people walked in and must have stared cause I was cold shivering, half humping with every clench, but it never ended. It seemed like the sensations of the pee coming to an end was just my muscles getting tired from so much pushing. I finished peeing and just hung there on the divider for a few more seconds as the last drips oozed out and the pleasure waves washed over me. I would absolutely recommend it, it has only been bested by one or two orgasms and just thinking of it makes my kegal muscles pucker with anticipation. 10/10

As is customary with my friends I will say this story is 95% true, not lying about the peeing though that was so amazing i couldn't exaggerate it if i tried.

Scrolling through this sub, getting riled up, reading obnoxious comments, and I think, I need to downvote this shit. But then I look to where my favorite button is supposed to be, and to my shock, it isn't there. But these comments have karma scores < 1, so I know someone is clicking on that succulent little downward arrow. So someone please, end my sorrow. How the fuck do you downvote on this sub?

To be fair, you have to have a very high IQ to understand the Planck Length. The energy differentials are extremely subtle, and without a solid grasp of theoretical physics most of the fermions will go through a typical observers head. There's also the physicists nihilistic outlook, which is deftly woven into his characterisation- his personal philosophy draws heavily from the universe's heat death, for instance. The field understands this stuff; they have the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate the depths of these sub-atomic worlds, to realise that they're not just tiny- they say something deep about REALITY. As a consequence people who don't understand sub-atomic physics truly ARE idiots- of course they wouldn't appreciate, for instance, the truth in Paul Dirac's existential catchphrase "But, Heisenberg, how do you know beforehand that the girls are nice?" which itself is a cryptic reference to Goethe's German poems *Sesenheimer Lieder*. I'm smirking right now just *imagining* one of those addlepated simpletons scratching their heads in confusion as Karl Ferdinand Braun's genius illuminates their television screens. What fools.. how I *pity* them. 😂

And yes, by the way, i DO have a Wolfgang Pauli tattoo. And no, you cannot see it. It's for the ladies' eyes only- and even then they have to demonstrate that they're within 1 degree of quantum state similarity of my own (preferably lower spin) beforehand. Nothin personnel kid 😎

Hmmm... where to start... well, first of all - i pity you - it must be rather miserable to be such an angry person. Secondly, if you are going to act big and tough and go off on ignorant insulting tirades, it might behoove you to learn how to spell... (i.e. "autstic", "opinionn", and "gamin".) Also, it's not very kind to use Autism as an insult - it is a very real condition that affects many people across the world and it is not a joking matter. 

To sum up, please think before you speak... or type. Thank you.

And let me know if any of the above words give you trouble, i can help you out with that.

Be nice.

Wow... Look at all these little puny idubbbz fans in the comments. Okay let me get something off my chest, rice is a genius and I love him. Rice completely destroyed idubbbz and idubbbz had nothing to say back, wow 😂 rice exposed idubbbz for being racist, ugly, boring, and rice refuted ALL of idubbbz points. Who cares if Ricegum said some things that could be considered bad in the past because we love him now as much as he loves us. Rice never takes Ls, cough gabby show 😜 And rices content is actually fun to watch. I bet the three bs in idubbbz all stand for boring 😂😂😂 Idubbbz got destroyed by rices fire bars 🔥 🔥 💯 Rices true genius shows here, as he perfectly dismantled idubbbz fragile career and ego. Can all the real and true ricegum fans smart enough to understand his genius stand with me?﻿

Nothing actually. It’s just a fucking question but since you wanna act like it’s such a bad question don’t even worry about it. I don’t see how in a community like this there are people who get on their high horse like they’re better than someone else but it’s cool. You can block me after this message and you can also royally fuck off and have a great rest of your existence.

I don't believe in air travel. It's all a hoax, along with "space" flight. How can something weighing 70 tons stay in the air? Birds fly because they weigh very little. Chickens don't fly because they weigh alot. And a so called airplane weighs significantly more than a chicken. I have never been in an airplane, and I don't know anyone who has. People who say they have are just shills for the government who uses small drones (that weigh less than chickens) to spray chem trails everywhere. Those drones only look like they are very high because they are so small. It's a known fact that past a mile high, there is not enough air to breathe. Yet we are expected to believe that these airplanes can somehow provide enough air to everyone on board? Please. Not to mention that flying that close to the sun would cook everyone alive.

I don't feel like I'm arguing, but, to clarify: I didn't build my tabletop system for most people. In my opinion, most people don't have the mental faculty, nor the patience for the "epic stories" they play to achieve. I'm tired of the industry telling people they are good at something that they literally are incapable of without someone telling them how to do it, and even then, they need someone to do half of it for them. I built this game to appeal to people who, don't think outside of the box, but rather, realize there are lots of boxes they can take pieces out of to build their own creation. It requires forethought, planning, and teamwork, and is specifically designed to discourage people who just want to roll huge amounts of dice (leaving it all to chance) and encourage people who prefer to carefully build a masterpiece (working to an end, steadily).

I realize this probably comes across as rude if nothing else, and I do not intend for that. I'm just tired of getting these sub 20 year old edge lords, with "muh character" who has no place in the world of the game they want to join, and can't understand that the reason their special little cupcake hasn't done anything epic after 8 sessions is because epic stuff happens after years, with a solid group, not weeks with random people in a revolving door setup for players and GMs. I'm tired of the hobby being over-commercialized (which is nothing new, they've been doing it from the start). I'm building this system, a webpage, a character sheet, and a desktop application, with a 3d environment and VR support, for free, because I enjoy it, not because I'm trying to appeal to the widest possible group of gullible tripe swallowers who will buy anything I put to paper because it's one less thing they have to think of.

Again, I avoided saying this earlier because I felt it was to aggressive, but, as stated, it is merely my opinion, and like all opinions, almost anyone who didn't come up with it themselves will disagree with it.

Ok I'm fucking sick and tired of this Rick and Morty IQ meme. Please just fucking stop. I don't even know the full story about why R&M fans think the show makes them smart. But honestly I am seriously getting SO pissed off at this meme. I can't believe I'm writing this, but I feel I should. I am so sick and fucking tired of this "Rick and Morty IQ" meme bullshit. Please, it's grating and painful to me. I don't even watch the show (I know almost nothing about it), but I just want this meme to die as soon as fucking possible. It's literally mocking fans of the show, and I am not okay with a meme meant to insult others. I don't know why fans think the show makes them smart, but holy fuck I don't give a goddamn shit. Please, for the love of all that is holy, let this meme die already.

MSF has perfected the vision control play-style that SK Telecom T1 used to have with Bengi. It's even better that they don't have similar problems in the jungle that SKT T1 had. We thought SKT T1 was the pinnacle for League Of Legends but MSF is rewriting history. Kk0ma and the rest of the staff are probably super jealous of the coaching staff behind MSF because this team is going to even greater heights.

As the lyrics of the song clearly state, the average layperson would not believe their eyes if 10,000,000 fireflies were to illuminate planet Earth, nor would the average person conclude by natural instinct that 10,000 lightning bugs acting as a collective group, are capable of embracing a human being 1,000 times without difficulty. By the same token, a gathering of lightning bugs in such vast numbers form a sort of “swarm,” and a swarm can collectively surround a human and deliver a “hug” that a single firefly, acting according to the dictates of his own conscience, simply cannot. Consequently, I was embraced 1,000 times by 10,000 luminescent insects. This may seem inconceivable due to the firefly’s soft-shelled body, which is common among all winged beetles within the Lampyridae insect family. Members of the scientific community may be tempted to cast doubt upon the possibility of this exchange due to the immobility of the prothorax and pterothorax, in addition to the elytra protruding outward while a firefly is engaged in mid-flight. However, I can testify to the accuracy of this exchange. I can furthermore add that while each individual hug took place, each firefly participated in the chemical reaction commonly known as bioluminescence in which the enzymes within the firefly, in the presence of oxygen, magnesium ions and ATP, emitted a chemically produced light or “glow” because they were happy to be hugging me.

The Left is shaken that some of their own have been emailing me privately. Well, I have a message for them. You live near MILO fans. You work alongside MILO fans. We are everywhere. You’ll never know who we are. But we are watching you. We hear your conspiracy theories; we see your hypocrisy. And when the time is right we will strike. MILO can’t be beaten because MILO is an idea. A symbol of rebellion against an arrogant, clueless, self-regarding elite. Your name-calling and character assassinations only make us stronger. You have 30 years of MILO to look forward to. Strap yourselves in, darlings.

I don't care that I'm getting downvoted. It doesn't would my inner child.

I care that people don't know the details about how to use basic English, they fuck up, others read their fuckup and think it's the right way to do it, therefore propagating the fuckup.

So, I show people the correct way to do it and why it's the correct way so that people can fuck up less.

People who take the time to downvote or reply with messages like your passive/aggressive insult are counterproductive; you're just angry that someone showed you how not to fuck up, because you want to be right in the first place.

You're bitter for some reason about being shown the right way to do something, which is strange and also shows a petty, "I want to be right, I don't want to admit that I still have things to learn."
It's like an angry child who pouts when he is both hungry and has to put his toys away before coming to the table. It's a childish and small-minded mindset.

That's what I see in downvotes and passive aggressive replies like yours.

That's not how you get better at doing things. You learn, you improve, by first admitting to your fuckup (if you made it), then you take the opportunity to learn how to do things the right way and you get better at doing things the right way.

In that, you learn how to fuck up less and improve yourself.

Do you think that I didn't go through this myself?

Wow Kim, you look young to already have a grandson! I had my first grandbaby at 48, I am 73 now and I have 7. Curtis is the eldest, then Stephanie, then Mitchell, Karen is the fourth eldest, Amanda, Bentley, and finally Sydney is the youngest. She's only 2! Gracious me, I will probably have great-grandchildren before I know it.

Hartley's jelly is my favourite food ever. I eat at least 5 tubs a day because I love Hartley's so much. I pray hourly to a shrine on which I have placed my Limited Edition Strawberry Lime Sundae Hartley's Jelly tub, along with my Nintendo GameCube and a bottle of lube.
I was sitting at my triple monitor quad core Less gay sli titan 420 x setup (on which I run portal), when I heard a knock on my door. As I opened the door, the sea of Hartley's jelly tubs parted. And standing in the doorway was him, the god, Mr. Hartley! I was speechless, but I wasn't given much time to make a statement as I was shoved to my knees, at eye level with the world-famed "wibbly wobbly jelly" Mr. Hartley always bragged about.

The plot is simple on purpose, it's the best adaptation of one of the oldest genres in all of cinema, the chase film. The whole movie is one big U-Turn because the main idea isn't the plot. However, if you look more closely, there's attention to detail that elevates the seemingly simple plot, into something more subtle, as it fits very well as an entry into the very popular post apocalyptic genre as well. It has very good characterization with minimal dialogue, and of course, it's a wonderful production on all technical levels. What I'm trying to say is, Mad Max: Fury Road is the perfect film.

Oh so know I get to shit all over libtards. I’m excited. So heres the deal, what you’re saying to me in and of itself is a mild form of fucking discrimination that you are treating me with. God forbid anyone other than us white cis men are ever at fault for ANYTHING. people have the right to think what they want but veterans have nothing to do with your fucking issues. veterans fight for rights, whether or no people outside of the army or military treat you poorly at times there is no reason to disregard something meant to show them respect. There will always be creepy white guys, there will always be creepy black guys. there will always be Muslim extremists who hate America and the Jewish people. by asking how I dare to share my opinion, I will say something similar to you. How fucking dare you tell me what I can or cannot believe. the reasoning for this country falling apart is because overly sensitive people like you and liberal feminazi’s have taken it among themselvesves to protest everything and anyone who has a differing opinion. I made my liberal teach cry because when I presented her with scientific evidence and facts, she was unable to rebuke and instead attempted to tell me that my opinions based on factual evidence is incorrect and to refuse to let me speak. Look, I often have the less popular opinion but heres the deal. The sooner thin skinned sissies like you learn that this world was, is, and always will be imperfect, the better off your life will be. I understand and am fully aware that women are more at risk of assault, but you have no right to accuse me of not knowing the way bad shit feels.

i was told the way i worked was inefficient today, to do things one at a time "look the cake halves are soft now theres crumbs on there) (which are covered by frosting btw and i was trained to stack them otherwise I'd tray em out on the extra rack separate). You think I haven't tried to do things one at a time and get out on time? It doesn't fucking work. Then I get asked "Why isn't this item out the big bosses are coming" (meaning my ass is on the line, and my boss is nice so then I'll hold my piss for two hours to make it nice for them) "I'm making it (next)" meanwhile others can stand around joke eat and check their phones, I'm working my ass off trying to do it all. When the nice zen Hispanic bread packer tells me I'm 'estressed, it's not fair,' you know it's not fucking fair. They need me to be happy bubbly but also need me to get all my stupid shit done. I'm supposed to be some kind of perfect angel held to higher standards than everyone else when I hear most people who try this job utterly fail. 

I found a way to increase variety which increases sales so I don't make all of like two items which don't sell and shrink on the same day but no, I'm inefficient.

No.

No more valium and bronkaid before every shift. I'll do things the way you say and they won't get done I would have gotten my plan done and got out 2 minutes late if I didn't have to stop and do things "one at a time." I was actually very proud that I discovered some ways to improve productivity with less effort based on my recipe requirements and how I can maximize like, doing 3 cakes with one frosting, one we need now, one for backup, one for. But no, that's inefficient.

When I take on too many tasks and become inefficient I recognize it and request repriority Oh except everything's a fucking priority and we're selling 15 sale cakes a day plus everything else I have to do. So since I'm now half hour late, might as well spend 15 minutes washing the buckets so I don't get talked to about that. "Yes I always try to use the open bucket of frosting" but my workload is so large I can't always check 7 buckets and reorganize them to know which one to use, I just needed to get it done an hour ago. Or how I injure myself weekly trying to work fast enough. Or how doing things one at a time means I need to pull out the entire freezer to put my shit in it or take more shit out. But ok. I'll do it your way, which doesn't work, because this shift used to be six or seven hours and now it's cut to four or five but I know they didn't have to do all that garnish I have to do now.. Why didn't anyone else follow the fucking plan o gram while they trained me in August but not spoken to about that? Why the fuck do they pick on me, because I care and I'm responsive? I won't discover new ways to do more with less effort. I'll do minimum work for minimum wage with no benefits since I can never call out or get time off.

I do not work inefficiently. But I will now. I'll save my efficiency for my housework and crafting and real cooking. You can have me at my minimum

You know it's bad when I don't cry and instead get icy silent death glare with monotone of basic politeness.

Looking for another job. The dude who works at the second job that hasn't called me for paperwork is baking the next few days while my homegirl has time off (they slammed, they a volume based business dollar store so prolly havent had time). Wish I could have time off. Wish I could leave early. I hear the closers and managers say "I don't have much do to" I never say that anymore now that suddenly I'm lead and only person on cakes after 2 months on the job.

This young man needs the Lord Jesus in his life! My grandson Curtis was arrested back in the early 90's for possessing a handbag full of Marijuana, and let me tell you, the thing that straightened him out was our Lord and Savior, Christ.

Wow you're stupid. I would never do any drugs, smoke and I don't drink any alcohol. Part of my identity is being 100% stable and in control at all times, I would never dull my senses in any way. I read, write, paint, study, and exercise every day to become a better person. I box and take weapons training to make sure I can defend myself and those around me. I'm 6'3", 200 pounds of muscle with a tested IQ of 175. I'm a philosopher and I study ethics in the pursuit of completing my book on how to be a better person. I live by a set of principles derived from logic and compassion. Don't try to define me you fuckboy.

By the title I mean say a tv show making fun of gamers by enforcing stereotypes. Also could we sue the developers or tv studio making said tv show?

I ask because watching last nights episode of criminal minds not only did the entire episode enforce the stereotype that games make people aggressive but a comment was made by dr Tara Lewis played by Aisha Tyler. “That could have been overwhelming to guys recruited for their ability to hang out their moms basement playing call of duty” it was at 21:38 and it’s episode 4 of season 13 for anyone interested.I’m a gamer and while I do know people who play call of duty none of them have committed murder as far as I know.

So like I already asked could this be classed as a hate crime? If a serious tv show like criminal minds made fun of or enforced a stereotype of say black people, Asian people, Irish people, homosexual people or even otherkin I imagine there would be serious questions raised so why is it not the same for gamers? If it is the same then how does someone go about taking legal action? The money would go towards Samaritans here in the uk as I know from personal experience many people use games as a escape from depression.

This is a serious question

If "fucking legend" means a 48 year old broke-ass alcoholic scammer who relies on a largely teenage audience for attention and should have been receiving therapy years ago, then yeah, he's a fucking legend.

I admit I was entertained by Shoenice back in 2012, but you can only watch so many videos of him downing a fifth of high-proof liquor before you realize it isn't just a gimmick. After watching his life gradually disintegrate over the years, I just feel sorry for him more than anything else, and I'm surprised he hasn't died of liver failure at this point.

The amount of casual fuckboys here who are willingly on the side of big business just going "Fucking hurr durrrr it's their right to close 'underperforming divisions' hurr durr" is seriously, probably the most disgustingly pathetic thing I've ever seen on this sub and I've seen some shit.

Are you that daft? They "underperformed" so fuck the fuckers, get rid of them? Simple as that, huh? The .xls said they need to be axed so get rid of them, because the numbers don't lie. Forget the corporate behaviors that caused this problem, right? 

Are you FUCKING serious? Dead Space was a niche franchise. It sold VERY WELL for a brand new IP in the "survival horror" genre. Very, very well. Dead Space 2 sold AT LEAST 4 million copies. Probably way more - considering 1.6 million of those are on Steam alone and that doesn't include 360, PS3, Xbox One back compatibility, or Origin.

They did not underperform. They made money on Dead Space 1 and 2. They simply didn't make $237587235 which is what EA wants. When your expectations and your budget is based entirely on a fantasy world, every studio underperforms. You cannot release a game that has this specific of an audience and then table flip when it has "only" sold 4 million copies within 6 years. That's ludicrous, unrealistic, and ignorant, in comparison to a game like Resident Evil 4, 5, or 6, all of which have sold at least 7.5 million, and RE4 is over 10 years old. By 2007 and 4 releases including Wii, RE4 had still only sold 1.7 million copies. It takes fucking time.

Do you know why it eventually sold that many copies? Because it's been re-released 9 times. GC, PS2, PC, Wii, PS3, PS4, 360, XB1, PC again, and, it was included in RE6 archvies/anthology version.

Do you know why RE5 sold that many copies? Because it's been re-released. PS3, PS4, 360, XB1, PC and again, and, it was included in RE6 archvies/anthology version.

Do you know why RE6 sold so many copies? Because it's been re-released. PS3, PS4, 360, XB1, PC.

Dead Space trilogy was released one time - 360, PS3, PC. Dead Space 3 on PC was exclusive to Origin, and 2 on Steam does not have the DLC available.

No fucking shit # 2 only sold "4 million" copies.

EA completely mismanaged this studio and drove them into the ground, the same way they do with their acquired 3rd party studios. They had completely unrealistic expectations for DS2 and 3, proving they have no comprehension of the games they are making and are only interested in money.

Do you honestly think any of their other studios get treated this way, assuming EA actually had any other first party studios still open that aren't EA Sports, and actually do anything? (Hint: They don't.) Don't get me wrong - they operate 37 different studios/offices. 3 of them are BioWare, another 3 of them are another developer, 2 of them are EA Sports, etc. But they also don't actually make anything, who knows why, and I bet if they didn't have 28 other needless studios, they might see higher profit margins.

If you defend this and just say "It's within their right and it's expected to shut down underpeforming studios" you have no fucking idea what you're talking about, no comprehension of why anyone is upset, and you need to shut the fuck up because spewing your uneducated opinion means nothing to anyone.

You can't fathom why anyone is pissed off, huh? It's eluding you? Not one possible reason huh?

 1. Dead Space is done. It will never come back. There will never be a plot resolution to $200 and at least 120 hours of millions of people's gaming lives. 

 2. The first Star Wars game with any chance of being worth a fuck since 2008 just got its developer closed and it's changing hands to some devs no one knows shit about, because EA didn't like the way it was going. That almost certainly equates to - it wasn't casual and filled with shitty microtransactions enough for the corporate stooges. It was a single-player, story based game with finite - if any- opportunities to continually milk customers for a long term revenue stream.

 3. EA is literally famous for destroying the gaming industry. There are so many articles and websites dedicated to just how much ruin they've left in their wake. They are the Donald Trump of the gaming industry. Yea, sure they may not be 1980s Atari famous, but if another game industry crash does happen, I bet you money it will be EA driving the bus.

 4. Not all of us are 8. EA destroyed our favorite game developers and franchises from our childhood. Command and Conquer, Populous, SimCity, ThemePark, ThemeHospital, Burnout, Mercenaries, Dead Space, these are all relics now because of EA. They also are holding hostage Dungeon Keeper, Crusader, Wing Commander, Ultima, and lots of other IPs.

 5. Many more IPs have sat stagnant for decades and almost disappeared because of their bullshit. System Shock is the most prominent example - it was locked up in legal limbo for almost 2 decades because EA didn't own all the rights - some stupid legal firm owned part of them - and neither was willing to let them go. It is only by the graces of Night Dive and CDP that System Shock 3 is finally happening and System Shock remake is coming out - crowdfunded by the way. 

 6. Star Wars, again. EA had a hand in LucasArts demise and has now taken on the Star Wars mantle, through their exclusivity deal with Disney to be the only developer allowed to make Star Wars games. And so far they've totally fucked it up. Battlefront 1 and 2 are both shit, and the only other game they released was a mobile game. 

So yea, there is MORE than enough reason to be physically ill about EA.

No. You know what? Just go away.

Every time someone posts a picture, a gif, a video, a screenshot, or just anything really that involves some kind of "corporate" thing - A video game, a logo, or probably just even the town hall of a city given how overboard you dummies go, you have to /r/HailCorporate it.

To be fair, you have to have a very high IQ to understand Adventure Time. The humor is extremely subtle, and without a solid grasp of group theory most of the jokes will go over a typical viewer's head. There's also Jake's everoptimistic outlook, which is deftly woven into his characterisation - his personal design draws heavily from Groening's Simpsons, for instance. The fans understand this stuff; they have the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate the depths of these jokes, to realize that they're not just funny- they say something deep about LIFE. As a consequence people who dislike Adventure Time truly ARE idiots- of course they wouldn't appreciate, for instance, the humour in Finn's existencial catchphrase "Mathematical!," which itself is a cryptic reference to Berrick and Keating's Ring K-theory, I'm smirking right now just imagining one of those addlepated simpletons scratching their heads in confusion as both binary operators unfold themselves on their television screens. What fools... how I pity them. 😂 And yes by the way, I DO have an Adventure Time tattoo. And no, you cannot see it. It's for the ladies' eyes only- And even they have to demonstrate that they're within 5 IQ points of my own (preferably lower) beforehand.

Let me try again since you morons don't read 10Ks or know any financial accounting or how to analyze a business.
There’s two aspects of Tesla we need to consider to understand why it’s a company that will definitely go bankrupt in the long term: earnings, cash flow/cash burn, and a shitty GAAP accounting technique that bumps up their gross margins.  

First, their earnings, while rising about 400 basis points quarterly may be impressive, but earnings don’t actually affect Tesla shareholders. While gross profit margins were $667 million in Q2 2017, and they have increasingly higher revenues, these figures don’t affect investors. The main reason being of an accounting technique – typically, R&D is included in your COGS (cost of goods sold), but Tesla counts that as part of SG&A. Once you shift R&D back to COGs, Tesla actually has the fourth highest costs in the automotive industry, only stacking behind automotive car giants (BMW, Mazda, Honda). Even if you were to consider SG&A with R&D again, their SG&A is so high that it annihilates earnings. This is why even though Tesla has been selling more cars, it doesn’t matter, because their EPS is so damn low (-2.7$ a share)  

Tesla does not currently generate any cash flow. Their operating cash flow in 2017 is around $-297 million, with free cash flows -$1.7 billion. They have around $3 billion in capex with a cash deficit of around $2 billion. They have only a few hundred million left in any existing credit facilities and they needed to spend 2-3 billion and their cash flow is imploding. It went from 200 million in FCF to -1.2 billion in less than a year. That means the 1 billion they raised in issuing new stock and raising convertible debt was completely wasted. Since inception, they've spent $6 billion. How can a company spend $6 BILLION USD and burn through so much cash that not only they're at NEGATIVE 1.2. BILLION USD cash flow, along with very negative FCF normalized projections. The worst part is this - while their competitiors (Toyota, Nissan, Ford) build cars that have higher MPG and miles per charge, they are waiting for industry standards to completely change to the point where they will just ramp up production and obliterate the electric car market. Maybe 10 years isn't right, but Tesla will be bankrupt soon. No company that burns through so much cash flow with NO money going to shareholder is going to last

Sometimes I like to sneak into the attic with my mummy's iPad to play Minecraft, one time I saw a hot boobie mod for Minecraft and decided to install it - later I saw a super duper uber hot sexy skin with big boobiez, it made my pee pee hard and I begin to touch it, then my sister came into the attic and saw me poking my now enlarged member, she then kissed my forehead and began putting her mouth over it, it felt good and then I peed white sticky stuff in her mouth (which she swallowed), I then began to cry and begged her not to tell Mom and Dad that I peed myself, she told me not to worry - it'll just be our secret. Next time Mom and Dad were out I peed in her no no zone, she seems to like the sticky, white pee. So don't worry, just get your sister to help you out.

Now, for the more uneducated readers of this post, let me inform you about an overlooked masterpiece known as The Cleveland Show. While your friends may be raving about Rick and Morty, I can assure you that their brains are far too minuscule to understand the complexities of Seth MacFarlane, whose work rivals that of Faulkner and Dostoyevsky. Case in point: the show's most essential character. Though he may not be the protagonist, he is the window through which the genius social commentary is shown. His name is Tim the Bear. Now, it is no coincidence that Tim the Bear is voiced by Seth MacFarlane. It is merely MacFarlane's way of showing that his struggles are those of the common man. In the episode titled "Birth of a Salesman", Tim gets Cleveland a job as a telemarketer. Much to Tim's dismay, Cleveland is better at telemarketing than he is. Upon learning this, Tim wishes bad things upon Cleveland. If you cannot see the biblical metaphor clearly inserted in this work of genius, I frown upon you. But I will explain nonetheless. Cain is supposed to represent Tim the Bear, while Cleveland represents Abel. In both stories, two brothers, or in this case close friends, are pitted against each other once one of them is favored by God, or in this case the company.In the episode, Tim the Bear prays to Jesus to punish Cleveland. A sign of him abusing the will of God. Similar to Cain abusing the will of God by murdering Abel. This serves as a cautionary tale, while also a biblical metaphor. Seth MacFarlane's unparalleled genius serves to remind us of how the struggles of ancient times are still prevalent within modern society. So while you may think the Cleveland Show is just a lazy compilation of racist jokes, you must dig deeper, for the show is filled with overt symbolism. Try finding biblical metaphors in an episode of Rick and Morty.

I was eighteen years old when I thought I had fallen in love. He showed enjoyment to my attempts at flirting, and made me feel valid in an otherwise dark time in my life. I thought I had fallen in love with the right one, until I realized it was just myself being foolishly led into a trap. 
 
It wasn't always terrible, you see. The first few months were genuine and sweet, and I had felt like I had found my paradise in him. I didn't see the red flags on the horizon, but how can you see red when the world is painted pink through the rose colored lens? Slowly over time, after I had turned nineteen, he acted distant around me. He didn't seem interested in what I had to say, and whenever he did feel like holding a conversation with me, he would never listen to me talk about myself. He wanted all the focus on him. He wanted it so much, he decided that pretending to break up with me would change things. 
 
And they did. He bent my already fragile grip on the world, just so I would devote myself entirely to him. He used me, in most ways possible. But did I ever protest? No. I didn't want to be the cause of one of his hundreds of suicide threats. He would threaten to kill himself if things didn't go his way. So I made extra sure that they would, even if it meant going against my friends. And in turn, he would continue to treat me like his emotional punching bag. But I take fault in that because I was the one who enabled it. 
 
It wasnt until after after I had turned twenty when I said enough was enough. I told him "if I mean nothing to you, then you mean nothing to me." Shortly afterwards, he had blocked me on all social media outlets, and proceeded to throw tantrums at my friends. Even going as far as taking my own experiences, and using them as his sob stories about how horribly I treated him. 
 
But that was just the beginning. My freedom came at a steep price. I woke up in a constant cold sweat with shaking limbs. I was prone to panic attacks. I was always so afraid of what people would think of me, and it became reflexive to bend to their will. It wasn't until I had started playing Reborn when I realized how valid my experience was. I saw myself in Titania, and immediately felt a deep connection with her. The attacks became less frequent, and I've slowly become more like my previous self. But that still doesn't stop the occasional episodes of fear brought on by my PTSD. The last attack I had was last night, when something had reminded me of Percival, and what he had done to me.
 
But that's another story for another time. The moral of this cautionary tale is to never tell lies, especially to yourself.

Honestly I'm done with this team. How the fuck is Jrue "$126 mil, 5 years" Holiday gonna score 4 points on 18% shooting?

I'm officially becoming a Nets fan. I just moved to Brooklyn, and I'm gonna become D'angelo Russell's best friend irl and we're gonna hang out all day and enjoy what the city has to offer in between games. We'll take videos on his phone of his teammates doing embarrassing things, we'll go to the famous CONEY ISLAND AMUSEMENT PARK, and of course we'll be getting involved in more shenanigans than either of us can count.

Sure it might get lonely when he's on the road, but there's Facetime and text and an America's crown jewel of NYC: a concrete jungle of 8 million people (and even more stories) at my disposal.

Who knows? Maybe I'll make some other multi-millionaire athlete friends through D'angelo. But no matter what happens between me and Odell Beckham Jr, I know one thing for certain: D-Lo (my nickname for him) will always be my number one, and that's a fact.

Anyway... Farewell, Pelicans. Farewell, my home city.

If you are a person of great intellect, I am sure you must be watching CBS masterpiece "Young Sheldon". I presume that if you watch "Young Sheldon", you must also be watching the tour de force known as The Big Bang Theory. I must also presume that if you watch Rick and Morty, you are merely trying to fool your weak minded friends into bowing down to your false intellect. While Young Sheldon and Big Bang Theory may seem like comedies on the surface, analyzing the subtext of the two shows reveals something far more intricate. Both shows serve as a parable for the struggles of society, both modern, and ancient. For example, the pilot episode of Young Sheldon concerns Sheldon going to high school. He assumes that high school will be a sanctuary of knowledge. Yet when he arrives, he discovers it is a cesspool of sex and substance abuse. This clearly serves as a metaphor for the corruption of capitalist values in America. America, as represented by the high school, should - in principle - exercise values that are for the people. So when Sheldon comes across the crushing realization that high school is not what he thought, it represents the realization that power to the people is an illusion in American society, propagated by the corrupt and unjust. To Sheldon's shock, his simpleminded family seems to have bought into this illusion. Sheldon refuses to touch his family's hands at the dinner table, symbolizing the pure-of-heart communists refusal to be infected by the disease of capitalist corruption. So the next time you watch the Big Bang Theory, know that it is not just intending to make you laugh, but to inform you of the faults in our brainwashed society.

Then we'll all fall together. 3 seasons of Support have hardened me against this. Too often has Soldier complained about me not healing when I was trying to fend off a Winston alone. Too often has Genji tried to YOLO SOLO the enemy team then complained about healing. Too often have I been alone on the objective while my teammates rush after an enemy flank like a terrier after a tennis ball. Too often have we watched our tank provide advancing cover, only to watch our teammates run beyond the safety of the shields and be cut down by the enemy team's focused fire.

A support doesn't start spiteful. We start wanting to help, wanting to help our team obtain victory. We try to corral our teammate's base impulses, their desires for glory rather than victory. More often than not we fail, over and over again. Slowly but surely we stop being willing to tolerate this maddening behavior. We stop caring about our teammates. It's not fun anymore, its work. We get fed up. We've been trying to keep them alive, game after game, season after season. Now? We're done. 

They will look upon us while at critical health. They will ask us over voice what we're doing. They will say to report us in all chat. They will huddle around health packs with some small semblance of hope. And how will we respond?

"Need Healing."

2b, or not to 2b, that is the question:
Whether 'tis nobler in the mind to suffer
The slings and arrows of outrageous fortune,
Or to take Arms against a Sea of troubles,
And by opposing end them: to die, to sleep
No more; and by a sleep, to say we end
the heart-ache, and the thousand natural shocks
that Flesh is heir to? 'Tis a consummation
devoutly to be wished. To die, to sleep,
To sleep, perchance to Dream; aye, there's the rub,
for in that sleep of death, what dreams may come,
when we have shuffled off this mortal coil,
must give us pause. There's the respect
that makes Calamity of so long life:
For who would bear the Whips and Scorns of time,
the Oppressor's wrong, the proud man's Contumely, [F: poor]
the pangs of despised Love, the Law’s delay, [F: disprized]
the insolence of Office, and the spurns
that patient merit of the unworthy takes,
when he himself might his Quietus make
with a bare Bodkin? Who would Fardels bear, [F: these Fardels]
to grunt and sweat under a weary life,
but that the dread of something after death,
the undiscovered country, from whose bourn
no traveller returns, puzzles the will,
and makes us rather bear those ills we have,
than fly to others that we know not of.
Thus conscience does make cowards of us all,
and thus the native hue of Resolution
Is sicklied o'er, with the pale cast of Thought,
And enterprises of great pitch and moment, [F: pith]
with this regard their Currents turn awry, [F: away]
And lose the name of Action. Soft you now,
The fair Ophelia? Nymph, in thy Orisons
Be all my sins remember'd.[2]

To be fair, you have to have a very high IQ to understand meth. The buzz is extremely subtle, and without a solid grasp of biochemistry, most of the euphoria will go over a typical user's head. There's also meth's methylamine which is deftly bonded to its chemical structure - its base compound draws heavily from amphetamine salts, for instance. The tweakers understand this stuff; they have the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate the depths of these euphoric feelings, to realize that they're not just good- they say something deep about LIFE. As a consequence people who dislike meth truly ARE idiots- of course they wouldn't appreciate, for instance, the episodes of psychosis after a week of binging without sleep as you shout your new catchphrase to the shadow people "GOD SENT YOU TO KILL ME!!," as you're in the grocery store buying milk, which itself is actually a hallucination. I'm smirking right now just imagining one of those addlepated simpletons scratching their heads in confusion as this genius unfolds itself in front of their eyes. What fools... how I pity them. 😂 And yes by the way, I DO have a methamphetamine molecule tattoo. And no, you cannot see it. It's for the ladies' eyes only- And even they have to demonstrate that they're within 5 IQ points of my own (preferably lower) beforehand.

Lord, forgive me if I think I'm in charge
But the snakes in the grass are starting to get smart
And the snake in my pants is starting to get hard
And I'm fucking everything with two legs and a heart
And some ass, and some titties, and an ATM card
Fetish for my flaws, and I lust for my scars
And this broke nigga dick guarantee I won't starve
Well I suppose, that you suppose, using hoes, is getting old
And you oppose, that maybe I, should grown on up, and iron clothes
And find some hope, find some work, and write in cursive
Been a flirter since my birth, they wrapped me up so i ain't fuck the nurse
Too numb to react when you struck a nerve
So I hits the bitch in a circle jerk
With me, myself, and my demon semen
Canine teeth got me feline feenin'
Hold up, rewind, make a beeline, feel like a bald eagle chiefin'
I ain't even breathin'
I'm a motherfuckin' ghost you can tell cause I flow
And I lose my head without even bleeding
Fuck what a motherfucker thought, that they knew about us
We got the juice and we keep on squeezing

I myself once learned 380 digits of pi, when I was a crazy high-school kid. My never-attained ambition was to reach the spot, 762 digits out in the decimal expansion, where it goes "999999", so that I could recite it out loud, come to those six 9's, and then impishly say, "and so on!"

Something like this probably happened. There's no reason to assume this particular story is real (and plenty of reasons to assume it's a lie). But fiction like this is nice. People have always loved stories like this.

Sure, there's no prose or nicely written dialogue, but that has always been secondary to the point of fiction. Ultimately, if you're not a sociopath, you empathize with the hero. That empathy is why you're able to watch movies and get into the plot, why you cry when Mufasa dies, why you like watching the good guys win. Redemption stories make *you* feel redeemed. Heroic stories make *you* feel like a hero.

I don't think we should pretend this is real. I don't think we should encourage people to bullshit on the internet. But I do think we should take a minute to appreciate why this obviously bullshit story sparked something in us.

It's nice to set down the bag of fucking bricks that is cynicism for a second.

I understand, this is a reddit for fans of the show, whether you're into cars are not, it's about the actual show. I am a fan of the show, but I'm failing to connect with anyone here, not sure if my interest is unique.
About me: I've been into driving cars (racing) since 1996. I was fortunate to live in an area with some curvy roads technical enough to challenge the skills of a driver, and focus on the grip ability of the car.
I really started the type of "cat and mouse" street racing we see on Initial D in 2005, and the local scene was somewhat active until 2010. I wasn't introduced to Initial D until 2010, and I was blown away by how true it was to real life driving principles.
After that, I really started to push my driving ability more. I became active in SCCA AutoX, NASA and SCCA club racing, Global TT, and LeMons/ChumpCar. In 2015, I stopped organized motorsports simply because my true passion for driving has always been the street. The sad thing is, at least where I live, there is zero interest in this type of thing, esp. from Initial D fans that I've met.
I don't personally understand. I would assume that Initial D would inspire Touge racing in application instead of geeking out about a cartoon, a cartoon about something that is somewhat taboo in real life, I get it. Even still, I feel like I honestly embody the 'Dream', and would rather act upon this passion instead of being just a fan. Yet, I have no idea what others see in Initial D (refraining from weeaboo hate rant), it's objectively a great show, but there's got to be at least a small number of you guys that honestly put the methods of the show into practice.
Anyways, thank you for reading. Good or bad, let me know what you think!

When that one person thinks he's something special and that he has his own box of free will so he decides to not only immediately reply to a message, but also to quickly come up with a "roast" of somebody. Anyway, yes I do, the humor's fucked up and it turns me on. On top of that it has helped me figure out my philosophical and religious views, and creating a character for myself Rick and Morty is the same to me this podcast, it helps me get a good laugh out along with some seriousness. But when cringy com- ments like this come by Ijust sit in the dark and think to myself that humanity is fucking doomed, and it truly is. You lMMEDIATELY reacted to the notification you got, probably spending thirty looking at which videos have liked, then using one of those types of video genres or topics to "roast" me. This tells me that you're just sitting there, waiting to get a notification for hours on end and then try to create some false beef like the person who replied to your comment with a similar "roast', you're equally alike so don't even reply negatively to him.

2017 is the year AAA gaming dies. I am tired of loot boxes. I'm tired of talking about them, I'm tired of what they represent, and I'm damn tired of having them invade nearly every console game that's come out this holiday ramp up.

Shadow of War ties itself to loot box progression in a single player game, Battlefront tied leveling up your character to a pay to win system, Ubisoft adds it to Assassins Creed but insists it's not pay to win guys! Bethesda adds a shitty micro transaction bloat ware store that no one asked for.

Enough.

I'm out. I've had it. I'm done. I will not be buying any of the previously mentioned games nor will I accept them as gifts this holiday. I will kindly thank the giver and quietly return them.

Publishers seem to have forgotten a very important factor, they need us more than we need them. They have confidence that we will all show up as anethsitized lemmings, lapping up whatever gruel they deign to throw us, chomping at the castoff bones of once beloved franchises.

Guess what assholes, the game is over. I have a big ass backlog and it looks like it's time to catch up. I will not be party to the death of our beloved hobby. I refuse to be part of the problem.

The time is now, apologists will stick their heads in the sand. Corporate shills and paid PR posters will flood this thread with misinformation and downvotes. I don't care. I don't need fake internet points, I need you to listen to me. If you do not take a stand against these practices, cosmetic or no, gaming as we know it has died.

We can no longer afford to ignore this. Vote with your wallets. No more preorders, no more locked content. No more micro transactions. No more loot boxes.

Give us content and we will pay for it. Offer multiple editions and we will choose how much to invest. Treat gamers like people, not like corpulent heaving wallets just lying there waiting to be consumed. There are still plenty of indie games and fair deals on the horizon.

Teach them you matter, that their franchises mean nothing without us, and that you're more than a number.

TL; DR Just read it.

"Down their spines". Does no one remember when Worf broke his back and it show's that he had it down his spine already? This is not a new thing people. These new Aliens are not Klingons. They look generic and uninspired. I am all for tweaking Klingon appearance but they still need to be recognizable at a glance as such! I see these things and they look closer to the Reptilians from Enterprise. They need to respect the cannon and the appearance of each race in Star Trek or any true fan will despise them for it. Instead of messing with the cosmetic appearance of everything only how bout we do some REAL risky things by I don't know........COVERING A NEW GENERATION of Star Trek instead of doing all these cowardly prequel's and revisit's. The last time we had a Boldly going where no one has gone before was back during Voyager. That started in 1995. 22 years since we have gotten one of those. I am not the least bit curious about the origins story's.I want new stories.﻿

I can't believe I supported this game. Not just with money; I shared this game. I told friends and family about it, I recommended it to my uncle who still plays, at least until he wakes up. I advocated Arya being okay, even... I defended this level of power creep because it was only natural to assume something like her would be free for everybody. All of the Tempest Trials rewards tend to be awesome, and not fat meme fonts so Japanese execs could laugh at us.

This has, in one move, drained away all of my faith in this company, all of my faith in this game, and done a fair number to make this week as shitty as it can be.

There seems to be a myth within Reddit and other social media sites that Trump supporters are stupid, uninformed, or blindly loyal to some hidden agenda.

Somehow supporting the president and defending him from outright lies and vicious attacks means they agree 100% with everything he says, does, or has done in the past.

This projected idea of absolutism that’s being placed on Trump supporters is frightening and polarizing.

The political absolutism started in 2007 when Obama supporters rallied to protect him from Hilary’s attacks and ignored his first flip-flop on Federal campaign finance. Even now in some places and with some of his supporters Obama did no wrong and can do no wrong (NSA domestic spying and Russia bribes for uranium aside).

Conservatives can support and defend something while not agreeing with it 100%. Why do you think New York and California are still free? (joke, i.e., sarcasm or humor for our more sensitive readers)

Trump’s supporters know he is narcissistic, loud, brash, has a weakness for beautiful women, and a history of disturbing behavior towards them.

His supporters are also intelligent enough to know a weakness for beautiful women didn’t disqualify JFK or Clinton. Nor did being narcissistic exclude Obama, George W., or any president.

As for brash and loud well, it comes from electing a New Yorker like Teddy Roosevelt or Donald Trump. A history of disturbing behavior towards women is severe and a huge character flaw that has been overlooked in many of our leaders like JFK, Clinton, and Trump.

Trump was elected despite his flaws and should not be attacked with lies and falsehoods, and that is why his supporters defend him.

LOL millennials and my generation are so fucking stupid. They create nothing and question why people want compensation when they do. This is real life and we haven't reached your "Marxist utopia" yet faggots. Rent, utilities, and food all cost money despite what your entitled NEET asses think. The reason games cost money is because the developers are spending their TIME and utilizing their SKILLS, just like a job, in order to produce something you consume once you're done working the job you hate or attending your psychology course at community college. When people stop buying games developers lose income and the amount of time they are able to dedicate to programming and development is cut resulting in a severe drop in quality or the collapse of the studio. The music industry was able to adapt thanks to touring and merchandise so the big names that pack arenas were alright, but the little guy who only saw a fraction of the income from the album is the one who truly suffered. I'm actually speculating that in the coming generations we are going to see a drop in the creative arts due to less people supporting and less children being propped up by their parents. As much as we hate on the boomers they had disposable income and bought their kids instruments or supported them through schooling, but your average millennial doesn't even have enough to buy a fucking meal at a sit down restaurant. I guess I could be completely wrong and we could have Dems for leaders for the following years and health insurance will be single payer and we will have social programs out the ass.

TLDR poorfag GEN Xers and millenials justify it under abstract philosophical arguments such as no physical product or durr hurr adapt your business model to the fact I'm a thief.

Yo, a word was needed to describe some behaviour that was dishonourable to express my hatred and considered a betrayal of our brotherly bond. Im a dumb nigger with no education and no understanding how it's intertwined with patriarchy, i come from a ghetto community completely detached from any culture, any history, any introspection and though, but, mah man, a word was needed and it just so happened to be the word faggot. Since im a dumb retarded black nigger with no culture or education, i dont understand that the word faggot was used as a verb to threaten to burn gay people in medieval times and is still inherently homophobic. 

Now, as a black piece of human garbage, im SUPER sensitive about even the slightest perceived racial transgression and would go ape shit if someone called me a nigger...which i totally am but "dats wrong homey, dat aint right". But i get most of my morals from ghetto 40 year old "men" with no understanding of manhood and wear their pants to their knees and show their underwear cause "whiteys be whack and shit and we homeys are dope and we just roll like dat...like jay z". And because i think thats normal, cause im ghetto, i have no idea gay people have more power than me and my community so i can disrespect dem like dat, aight G? Even though a gay guy invented the computer, most philosophers and artists that set the foundation for western civilization were gay...my understanding of gay people is anal sex...but most black leaders know this and dey be jealous and stuff...cause black people were "KANGS AND SHEEIT", right? 

Listen thug boy, your people are black. Theyre failures and the lowest trash on the planet. You dont get to disrespect people without it being reciprocated to you. now calm down and take a dick up your ass nigger. But please dont take any of that as racist and "chill". Remember, you're morally and culturally inferior and your mom was as ghetto as you. Black "normal" is you...and that isnt exactly a good thing. The world isnt a rap video filled with ghetto trash. And even your heroes, the thugs, have submitted to cultural changes that are being imposed on them because theyre too subhuman to generate that change themselves. 

You black pieces of gorilla filth. You do nothing all day but complain about discrimination and make constant appeals to people's humanity but have no humanity to express yourself. See why people shit on you? Because you deserve it. Dumb animal. 

P.s. Notice how white and other minorities are more advanced and civilized than you since theyre less homophobic and you're just a worthless ghetto fuck? Ever make you think? :)

I'm planning to enter the Simple Cove contest. You don't need to explain anything to me or make a passive-aggressive comment about the fact "that 1 in 450,000 subscribers...". The first sentence in my post ended with "to me." I am well aware there are others that are salivating at the thought of a 2x4 contest, and it wasn't meant for any one person in particular. I don't even know if one person suggested it, or if one person made the decision. 

I'm of the mind that if you don't at least say/do something than you have no right to really expect your opinion to be heard and valued in the future. That's all I was doing - voicing the opinion.

Besides, with the way posters on this sub trash and crucify Ana White and/or pocket hole joinery, you'd think a 2x4 contest would be highly unsavory.

Also on the comedic side - I don't care about fake internet life points. If people want to downvote someone for an opinion, that's cool. I have actual, real-life concrete things to think about that matter. Do people who go around downvoting people's constructive opinions think that they're in some sort of code Matrix? Do you think you're going to magically affect the person on the other side with fake arrows and numbers? Do you see life in a green vertical code scroll? Are you Neo? Are you over or under the age of 14? Food for thought.

To be fair, you have to have a very high IQ to understand Sharia Law. The justice is extremely subtle, and without a solid grasp of Islamic Theology most of the laws will go over a typical infidel’s head. There's also Mohammad's nihilistic outlook, which is deftly woven into his holiness - his personal philosophy draws heavily from Quranic literature, for instance. True muslims understand this stuff; they have the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate the depths of these laws, to realize that they're not just just- they say something deep about LIFE. As a consequence people who dislike Islam truly ARE infidels- of course they wouldn't appreciate, for instance, the humour in Mohammad’s existencial catchphrase "Allahu Akbar," which itself is a cryptic reference to the Dabiq (Arabic: دابق‎‎).I'm smirking right now just imagining one of those addlepated simpletons scratching their heads in confusion as Allah's genius unfolds itself on their television screens. What kuffar... how I pity them. And yes by the way, I DO have a tattoo of Aisha. And no, you cannot see it. It's for the Goat’s eyes only- And even they have to demonstrate that they're within 5 IQ points of my own (preferably higher) beforehand.

Talking about yourself I presume? My IQ is 134 variance of 10+-

Although my IQ is slightly above average range, I do not consider my IQ worthy of carrying on, as it is below genius level and I believe in a better world through eugenics. So, I haven't had children, nor do I or my gf have any intentions of children.

I'm not smart enough to fix anything (hence no reproduction) but I am more intelligent than most, and that fucking terrifies me.

But ignorance is bliss and attacking one guy for sharing his opinion is much easier than realizing the world is full of idiots, so you do you

To be fair, you have to have a very high IQ to understand Spooky Boi Memes. The humour is extremely subtle, and without a solid grasp of the month october and spook philosopy most of the jokes will go over a typical viewer’s head.

As a consequence people who dislike Spooky Boi Memes truly ARE idiots- of course they wouldn’t appreciate, for instance, the humour in Mr. Skeltal’s existential catchphrase “Doot Doot”, which itself is a cryptic reference to Turgenev’s Russian epic Fathers and Sons.

So here I am in this stinking cesspool of socialism called California. I'm at a Home Depot and got one of those nice rolling flat carts. Found one that actually rolls. I put a big thing of insulation on it and went around the store and I picked up a whole bunch of other items I needed and put them on the cart.

Then I parked the cart in the end of an aisle to get a few other things. When I got back the insulation was tossed on a regular shoppign cart and all the other items I spent an hour looking for were gone and the cart was gone.

Some liberal and it was a liberal I don't care what you FUCKING liberals say it was a liberal because a conservative wouldn't do this. Some liberal was too lazy to move his fat ass out to the parking lot and get a cart of his own so he stole mine. I had to go through the store and look for it all again and replace all the items.

This is why I live in Kentucky instead of this stinking cesspool of socialism called Commiefornia. It's because in Kentucky real people live there. People with a conscience people with a soul. They would never do that in Kentucky. They do that here in California because everyone here is a FUCKING RETARD. And they should all be hunted down. Like rabid dogs and exterminated.

You're not Christian so stop trying to explain Christianity. These passages were not "wrongly translated" and they were "meant" to be put into the texts or rather, included in the Bible.

The Bible clearly states that God created man and woman and that they were to be joined together as one. Procreation cannot occur if men have sex with men and women with women. God's world is about what is "normal" and moral and right. Men screwing other men in the butt was never God's plan for humanity.

You should rethink Hinduism. There is a reason why Hinduism is mostly confined to one nation whereas Christianity is world-wide.

You nor your family has a viable excuse. God will inquire of you why you believed in a false religion, why you pursued it while ignoring Christianity before He sends you off to hell. Seriously.

Research. Research Christianity as if your life depended on it, because it does. Read up on as much of it as you can. Find the truths. The prophesies that have been fulfilled and are being fulfilled even today. Read up on the history of the Jews and compare that to what is found in the Bible. Research the non-Biblical historical texts. The archeological evidence found. There is a ton of videos, documentaries, books and religious texts that prove God is real, the Bible is true and the end is almost here.

God has given mankind everything they need to arrive at the truth but if you fail to make even the slightest effort you will pay the price.

At first glace we might assume that "Eels & Escalators" is simply a sub-aquatic take on the classic "Snakes & Ladders". But this is not the case at all. Let's take a closer look at the game board.
 

 
It seems simple enough. There's a start square, a finish square, a path between those two points and a series of eels and escalators. This is where the shenanigans begin. In a typical game of Snakes & Ladders, landing on a ladder is a positive move and takes you closer to the finish line. Snakes have the opposite effect. In Eels & Escalators, however, one of the escalators actually impedes your progress and one of the eels takes you to the square adjacent to the finish line.
 

 
Then there's the dice. Given that the object of the game is to travel along a path, you'd expect the dice to be numbered, right? Wrong. In Eels & Escalators, both dice feature pictures of eels and escalators. Roll two eels, you ride the eel. Roll two escalators, you ride the escalator. Roll one of each, you sit there wondering what the heck you are supposed to do and why the game even comes with two dice when your eel/escalator fate could be much more easily decided with a single die. The main path through the middle of the board is completely useless, by the way, since without a numbered die you have no means of navigating it.
 

 
Provided you don't roll any unmatching pairs, you might get lucky and ride three escalators in a row. Unfortunately, none of the escalators take you to the finish square so this does not constitute a win, but it's the closest you're going to get. From that point on you have no choice but to continue rolling the dice until you ride every single eel, finishing with the "You Lose!" eel. That's right - there's a losing space and the only way to end the game is for all players to land on it. 
 
In conclusion, Eels & Escalators may be one of the most sadistic board games in existence and fully justifies SpongeBob's use of Bad Word #11.

Honestly I'm done with this team. How the fuck is Jrue "$126 mil, 5 years" Holiday gonna score 4 points on 18% shooting?

I'm officially becoming a Nets fan. I just moved to Brooklyn, and I'm gonna become D'angelo Russell's best friend irl and we're gonna hang out all day and enjoy what the city has to offer in between games. We'll take videos on his phone of his teammates doing embarrassing things, we'll go to the famous CONEY ISLAND AMUSEMENT PARK, and of course we'll be getting involved in more shenanigans than either of us can count.

Sure it might get lonely when he's on the road, but there's Facetime and text and an America's crown jewel of NYC: a concrete jungle of 8 million people (and even more stories) at my disposal.

Who knows? Maybe I'll make some other multi-millionaire athlete friends through D'angelo. But no matter what happens between me and Odell Beckham Jr, I know one thing for certain: D-Lo (my nickname for him) will always be my number one, and that's a fact.

Anyway... Farewell, Pelicans. Farewell, my home city.

Remmy the rat from Ratatouille has Super-Powers
Since its canonical Ratatouille and The Incredibles take place in the same universe my theory is that Remy the Rat has cooking superpowers and also that thing where he controls the pasta boy like the spineless marionette that he is is also a superpower. Note that the very first thing that Remy helps that gangly ginger broomstick with in the kitchen, which he later turns into his sweatshop where the rich dine on the spoils of the Working Man, is soup. You might be saying to yourself, "___, you already have me convinced, how do we end the totalitarian Stalin-esque regime of this man who sports the devil's curly red hair. while these sheeple on the internet do nothing and drink their buzzfeed soup and have the audacity to call themselves "feminists" when nobody even mentions how there are no female rats in Ratatouille, how do you have this supercolony of asexually reproducing genius male chef rats and nobody is going around asking questions? Is it because no one can ask these questions while Big Daddy Capitalism is going around spreading propaganda with our information sponges that we call children on his lap as he reads to them Dr. Seuss's Rat in the Hat? Is the lack of female rats in this movie a subliminal nod to the fact that while cooking is stereotypically seen as a more feminine pursuit, most chefs in well-established restaurants are men?" To which I continue, the first item Remy helps prepare is soup. Perhaps a clever hint that our favorite four legged cartoon rat has soup-er powers. With all of this new information you're probably asking yourself, surely there is deeper meaning to
Ratatouille than I had previously taken in? Surely, you have spent your life in a cave if you don't see the true message that Pixar has been yelling at us for years. The lead antagonist in this classic piece of cinematic eye candy is Anton EGO. Remy effectively KILLS EGOs career. That's right, Pixar is the lighthouse that has been guiding you through the fog and YOU? You are the ship that Titanic'd into the cliff regardless. Pixar has been telling you for years that happiness is found through EGO DEATH. Ego, the miser of a food critic, only finds happiness through the complete loss of subjective self-identity, induced by rat salad so good that it created a fake memory of him as a kid that quelled the demons in his head. He is seen at the end, blissful, and finally happy. All while Chef Fuccboiardee takes all the credit

Does anyone here like incest in anime?
Honestly, I love it. I really enjoy the taboo of it and it's one of those things that I'm a sucker for. If you sprinkle even just a little bit in, I'm instantly more interested in the show. I'm not sure when I realized I loved it so much but Oreimo may very well have been what ignited my passion for it, or at the very least made it apparent. It's just so... goooooood.

By becoming my patron, you will have left the casual rabble of those who stumble upon one of my videos in the darkness of a blurry YouTube browsing session.  So too will you have marked yourself out from those whose greatest effort in supporting my channel was to click the 'subscribe' button once, and then never apply fingertips to keyboard.  The next circle up the hierarchy will be those who bother to comment, but whose comments soon get lost amongst the thousands of others.  Above those are the followers on Facebook and similar 'social media', who get to feel part of a smaller coterie, which gets its own messages and dialogue with me.  You, though, will stand on the top level of the ziggurat of my viewers, with my other patrons - those excellent fellows who put their money down and proved the conviction of their belief that my channel was something of worth, and something with a potential for at least comparative greatness.  To these I will owe the most responsibility and responsiveness.  To the wishes and suggestions of these I will listen the most closely, and to these I will give my most detailed of explanations, advance notices, and, if ever necessary, apologies.

Well, if intercourse with traps is gay, then surely traps count as men and therefore if a woman performs coitus with a trap then she is straight, BUT on the other hand the attraction towards traps is centred around an attraction to the female appearance and therefore the initial interaction and sexual tension between a woman and a trap has to be labelled as gay. Truly, I believe that such a meeting, between the initial sight of the trap and the trap-woman sex cannot be labelled neither gay nor straight, but rather must be represented in a graph format. From point of the primary encounter it would be very gay but as they got to know each other, and as the woman begins to work out that the trap is in fact not a woman the gradient will be constantly negative, with the straight-gay value trending towards straight. Due to the 3rd law of Traps any interaction with a Trap cannot be bisexual, as the recipient of the trap can only observe the trap being a man or woman at any point and never both, and therefore there is a break in the line at the bisexual midsection. To understand what happens after the break, one must hypothesise what is happening during it. At the point of the break, someone with lesser knowledge of traps would say that this is the point at which the observer discovers that the woman they were planning to have sex with actually has a penis. As an experienced Trap expertologist, we tend to say in these such moments that “the Trap has been sprung”. Now, as the interaction with the trap continues, the recipient must come to increasingly accept this person as a Trap and therefore as a man and also develop a sexual attraction towards him, especially during the point of intercourse. And so, in the case of women, this will he represented on a graph in a logarithmic format with an exponentially increasing (incrementing in negative Y direction) gradient. Before coming to a conclusion we must take into account that this is all a hastily written hypothesis, which doesn’t take into account the finer details of the “trap” and the fact that the woman went into this meeting expecting to “get off” with another woman and will have therefore developed a level of horniness and affinity with them based on them being a woman, which may or may not have leaked over into later interactions where the trap turns out to be a man. Anyway, despite that, in conclusion one can say that the interaction starts out gay and then after the reveal of the penis rapidly increases towards being straight.

The fuck? Any cursory overview of world history will lead to you to being an intense fan of the German martial tradition. Name a single period in history in which the German military force did not employ optimal tactical methodology. Got one? No, because there isn't one. Ancient times? The German warrior was feared across all of Europe and caused the defeat of the mighty Roman legions. Medieval? The Holy Roman Empire employed the most disciplined of pike lines. Modern? Ever heard of a thing called Blitzkrieg? Enough said. So yeah, think before you try to call someone a "germaboo", because you might get destroyed just like this again.

I don’t care about femmies, and lezzies wanting to merry, and live together. I really would have little about femmies, and lezzies if they didn’t pose the risk to public health that they do, and I’m referring specifically to their disgusting physical activities! The rectum is NOT a sexual organ, and should never be used that way! I want the sodomy activities of these groups stop!

You are playing 2fort, in a somewhat empty server. Stuck at a 4v5, a peculiar fellow joins the server named "Pixie the Fempyro Dragon", and you decide to play Soldier. You run into the BLU base, and steal their intel. "I'm doing it! I'm gonna cap the intel!" you think, blasting your way to victory, when all of the sudden an enemy pyro turns the corner. His degreaser is aimed at you, and he's got an unusual pink Brigade Helm with orbiting hearts. You fire a rocket, and you see the crimson lightning fly out of your launcher. It's a random crit! The pyro is done for! But all of the sudden, the pyro DEFLECTS the rocket, dealing a lethal blow to you. And in the killcam you see them do the Gas Blast taunt introduced in the Pyro Update, and a message appears in chat. Pixie the Fempyro Dragon: Oowpsie!!!! :3 I made a big stinky OwO You do not understand. You try to respond but your hands are paralyzed. A singular droplet of cold sweat streams down your nose. Your confusion turns into terror as you glance at their profile picture, which is a BBW-futa anthro fox. Your face turns red. White spittle is coming out of the corners of your mouth. You try to spam your lenny face bind but you simply cannot. The terror fades away, and what remains is a sense of existential dread. Nothingness. You give up on even trying to move out of spawn. Hours pass, days pass, and weeks pass. Engineers passing by on their way to the Intelligence would tell stories of you. "Say, Dell, you see that stone-faced fella at resupply?" "Why I have, Buck. What's up with him?" "Why I reckon he one of them AFK types." The Engineers try to unravel the mystery, but never come close. The secret remains buried inside of you, burning at your very core. As the Engineers, Snipers, and Demomen of Teufort leave, you are all that remains of the server. Your legacy is merely a whisper in the wind.

Hey ____

I can’t believe I’m about to show you this... 

But honestly, it’s the right thing to do.

We have a NEW pack called Cymatics Sosig for Xfer Serum and Nexus

THOUSANDS of hours have been put into this CRAZY pack.

And if you’re wondering WHY we’re spoiling you guys like this, allow me to explain:

We wanted to create the ultimate pack, something that captures the vibe and feel from artists like Carnage, Malfoy Garlic, and DJ Phatnubs.

We have spent TONS of time AND money 💰💰💰💰 on making this pack.

And to celebrate the release of this pack, we’ll be GIVING AWAY A SET OF YAMAHA HS8  49000 Xtra Mega Super Deluxe Martin Garlix Branded SPEAKERS!

All you have to do to enter for a chance to win is:

Buy the pack
Sell your soul to us
Give us your first unborn child

It's as simple as that!

A lot of hard work goes into ALL of our sounds, but you might be surprised at JUST how epic the ones for Sosig came out!

-----------------------------------------------
PAY CLOSE ATTENTION
-----------------------------------------------

And once you’re done doing the things listed above, you’re going to want to come back and read the rest of this email, because today I finally reveal some never before released details about Sosig.

Now, we’re still not ready to tell you EVERYTHING just yet, but I’ve decided to crack a little bit under pressure after I got swamped with 420,069 questions from producers in just the last 69 hours.

So, I've put together a Q & A below with the questions that I'm seeing most frequently, because I'm guessing they’re the ones on your mind, too...

Okay, let’s get straight to it.

-----------------------------------------------
YOUR QUESTIONS ANSWERED
-----------------------------------------------

1.What is Sosig exactly?

This was by far one of the hardest packs we’ve ever created, because our packs are already known for one thing: excellent quality. 

So, to push our limits, we had to deliver a pack where EVERY SINGLE preset and sample is breathtaking, professional and on a completely different level from anything else we’ve ever done.

To accomplish this, we spared no expense and worked ONLY with world class producers to create a pack that gives years worth of inspiration to ANY producer. 

In fact, Drew and the production team even re-worked and revamped the pack FIVE times over the course of 69 months. 

They ended up cutting out ANYTHING that wasn’t a 10 out of 10 in quality, usability, and originality  (literally chopped 2000+ samples).

It was a bit frustrating at times because of how many late nights and early mornings the team went through and how much sleep and family time had to be sacrificed, but it was beyond worth it in the end.

And as a result, Sosig ended up being a collection of over 2,000 of our absolute best samples & presets created to do one thing: make everything else obsolete.


2. What genres can I produce with Sosig?

Sosig was actually designed to help ANY producer.

However, this pack works best for trap, dubstep, and booming future ass

Our community has a HUGE variety of producers that make everything from Trap, Dubstep, and Future Bass, to even genres like DnB, House, and Pop… AND EVERYTHING IN BETWEEN!

So to give you the creative freedom you’ve been asking for, we constructed Sosig in a such a way that you’ll have a large selection of high quality samples that will serve as building blocks to start any kind of song when the inspiration strikes.

3. How much will Sosig cost? 


We are hoping that we get enough upvotes so that we can gouge you for our shitty samples, but that is just a hope.

The truth is, we don't know what we’re going to charge yet. 

But I’m not going to lie, it’s going to be a good chunk of change, because as I mentioned earlier, we literally spared no expense creating Sosig, and it turned out incredible. 

In fact, we ended up putting in roughly $69,500 into this project.

And that’s actually more of a conservative estimate, because we didn’t even fully count what we pay our in house production team at Cymatics, which ALONE cost us around $22,000 a month.

If you're wondering how on earth we could have racked up these expenses, it was a combination of:

More Than a Dozen Studio Sessions
Hiring Professional Mixing Engineers
Professional Pianist
Professional Foley Recording Sessions
World Class Sound Designers
Percussion Instruments That We Specifically Bought For This Pack
Experienced Drums Designers
World Class Sosig Users
+ A Lot More!
On top of that, adding a team of the best EDM producers in the scene sent our budget through the roof! 

These guys play shows for thousands of dollars, so you can only imagine how much it cost to get them involved in something like this.

But this was CRUCIAL to us, because we put quality over EVERYTHING. And I think when Sosig comes out, you’ll be glad that we did!

I mean, think about it, if we would have cheaped out on studio time, Tiesto may have never wanted to use our vocal samples in his newest hit “BOOM”.

Anyway, TLDR: New pack, sell us ur soul, we gonna gouge you for shitty presets.

If you have any other questions please just REPLY to this email ASAP!

Yesterday I went through thousands of emails, and today will be no different.

I’ve decided to dedicate ALL DAY to reading your responses so I can make sure no one is left in the dark on Sosig.

Cheers, 

~Steven

Same thing as in most media these days, the heretics really are proactive in pushing their profligate agenda and flaunting their perversion. It has no place in common entertainment (or on this Earth, for that matter), and none of these vaunted "social values" will change that. INB4 the obligatory flood of downvotes: won't change anything. Eat your heart out.

> dude, you really think they'll make a space pride parade?

They would if they could. 

> also you stalked my comments and the worst thing you could find was me supporting lepin? really?

Alright, let *me* try without even leaving this thread. You exhibit moral myopia in that this profligacy doesn't bother you, and you are blind to how it's being forcibly inserted into any piece of media in a desperate attempt to normalise it. In real life, nobody with a life cares about heretics' 'lifestyles' or whatever makes them happy; it's still perverse, we normal people don't want this stunted slime in our sight again, and we have bigger fish to fry.

> the ability to post doesn't make you intelligent

Likewise. Now get out of here.

This message is for anyone in concern. I'm a supporter of Donald Trump. I love him and his very intelligent family. And this is like Forbes Magazine are in conspiracy to break this man financially, it seems. Donald Trump has more money than he ever had. So Forbes making noise about some three point something billion is fake news and therefore Forbes is on the drain-the-swamp list. Steve Bannon will make sure magazines and businesses like you will go down because Donald Trump is very intelligent, very handsome. His children are very beautiful, very handsome. They have the highest IQs than any racist or anybody in this county. And we love him, and he will continue to run this country, and his children will too. So fuck Forbes Magazine, and you can stick that fake news up your ass.

To be fair, to have a very high iq to understand rick and morty, you have.  Extremely subtle, the humor is, and go over a typical viewer's head, without a solid grasp of theoretical physics most of the jokes will.  Also rick's nihilistic outlook, there is, which his characterisation is deftly woven into - his personal philosophy draws heavily from narodnaya volya literature, for instance.  This stuff the fans understand; the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate the depths of these jokes, they have, just funny- they say something deep about life to realize that they are not. As appreciate a consequence people who dislike rick and morty truly are idiots- of course they would not, for instance, the humour in rick's existencial catchphrase "Wubba lubba dub dub," which itself is a cryptic reference to turgenev's russian epic fathers and sons, smirking right now just imagining one of those addlepated simpletons scratching their heads in confusion as dan harmon's genius unfolds itself on their television screens, am I.  What fools...  How I pity them.  :joy: And yes by the way, rick and morty tattoo, I do have. And no, see it you cannot.  It is for the ladies' eyes only- and even they have to demonstrate that, within 5 iq points of my own (preferably lower) beforehand, are they.  Herh herh herh.

Just finished watching mall cop which is not only a classic movie but it also stars Paul Blart who is a criminally underrated actor. I mean for fucks sake, people these days just don't know what real acting is, no they just wanna see Bryan Cranston in breaking bad saying shit like "i am not in danger, i am the danger", oh and my favourite "RUN". Meanwhile people with real potential like paul Blart are left in the dust, struggling to find work. It honestly makes me sick that true heroes like Adam Sandler, Amy Schumer, and of course Paul Blart are mocked and treated like a joke by critiques but when these people past away they will be remembered as the golden standard of what every actor should aspire to be, MARK MY WORDS.

I had a dream of my aunt. She was wearing a yellow raincoat and nothing else. It ended just above her knees and you could see her slender legs. As I looked at her she saw me staring and gave me a sly smile. Then she unbuttoned the coat and pulled it open. I saw her naked, shiny breasts. They were made of cheese. So I approached her and smelled them. They definitely smelled like cheese too. God, it was such a turn on. I started licking them. The distinct, mouthwatering taste of cheese filled my mouth. I was ecstatic. And so was she. She moaned silently and pushed my head deeper into her soft, cheesy breasts while running her hand through my hair. Oh my god, it was heavenly. My peepee started feeling weird. I woke up and felt something wet in my pants. It was melted cheese.

I was shooting heroin and reading “The Fountainhead” in the front seat of my privately owned police cruiser when a call came in. I put a quarter in the radio to activate it. It was the chief.
 
“Bad news, detective. We got a situation.”
 
“What? Is the mayor trying to ban trans fats again?”
 
“Worse. Somebody just stole four hundred and forty-seven million dollars’ worth of bitcoins.”
 
The heroin needle practically fell out of my arm. “What kind of monster would do something like that? Bitcoins are the ultimate currency: virtual, anonymous, stateless. They represent true economic freedom, not subject to arbitrary manipulation by any government. Do we have any leads?”
 
“Not yet. But mark my words: we’re going to figure out who did this and we’re going to take them down … provided someone pays us a fair market rate to do so.”
 
“Easy, chief,” I said. “Any rate the market offers is, by definition, fair.”
 
He laughed. “That’s why you’re the best I got, Lisowski. Now you get out there and find those bitcoins.”
 
“Don’t worry,” I said. “I’m on it.”
 
I put a quarter in the siren. Ten minutes later, I was on the scene. It was a normal office building, strangled on all sides by public sidewalks. I hopped over them and went inside.
 
“Home Depot™ Presents the Police!®” I said, flashing my badge and my gun and a small picture of Ron Paul. “Nobody move unless you want to!” They didn’t.
 
“Now, which one of you punks is going to pay me to investigate this crime?” No one spoke up.
 
“Come on,” I said. “Don’t you all understand that the protection of private property is the foundation of all personal liberty?”
 
It didn’t seem like they did.
 
“Seriously, guys. Without a strong economic motivator, I’m just going to stand here and not solve this case. Cash is fine, but I prefer being paid in gold bullion or autographed Penn Jillette posters.”
 
Nothing. These people were stonewalling me. It almost seemed like they didn’t care that a fortune in computer money invented to buy drugs was missing.
 
I figured I could wait them out. I lit several cigarettes indoors. A pregnant lady coughed, and I told her that secondhand smoke is a myth. Just then, a man in glasses made a break for it.
 
“Subway™ Eat Fresh and Freeze, Scumbag!®” I yelled.
 
Too late. He was already out the front door. I went after him.
 
“Stop right there!” I yelled as I ran. He was faster than me because I always try to avoid stepping on public sidewalks. Our country needs a private-sidewalk voucher system, but, thanks to the incestuous interplay between our corrupt federal government and the public-sidewalk lobby, it will never happen.
 
I was losing him. “Listen, I’ll pay you to stop!” I yelled. “What would you consider an appropriate price point for stopping? I’ll offer you a thirteenth of an ounce of gold and a gently worn ‘Bob Barr ‘08’ extra-large long-sleeved men’s T-shirt!”
 
He turned. In his hand was a revolver that the Constitution said he had every right to own. He fired at me and missed. I pulled my own gun, put a quarter in it, and fired back. The bullet lodged in a U.S.P.S. mailbox less than a foot from his head. I shot the mailbox again, on purpose.
 
“All right, all right!” the man yelled, throwing down his weapon. “I give up, cop! I confess: I took the bitcoins.”
 
“Why’d you do it?” I asked, as I slapped a pair of Oikos™ Greek Yogurt Presents Handcuffs® on the guy.
 
“Because I was afraid.”
 
“Afraid?”
 
“Afraid of an economic future free from the pernicious meddling of central bankers,” he said. “I’m a central banker.”
 
I wanted to coldcock the guy. Years ago, a central banker killed my partner. Instead, I shook my head.
 
“Let this be a message to all your central-banker friends out on the street,” I said. “No matter how many bitcoins you steal, you’ll never take away the dream of an open society based on the principles of personal and economic freedom.”
 
He nodded, because he knew I was right. Then he swiped his credit card to pay me for arresting him.

I think that the S5 finale of Arrow was a fantastic end to a fantastic series and they spat in its face with the S6 premiere. Lian yu explodes marking the end of an era and NO MAJOR CHARACTERS DIE?! What the fuck is that about? We have Samantha who just so happens to die when it's convenient which is a directing shitshow, we have Thea who's "stuck" in a coma and a villain that we see resurrected before she was even killed? Why the hell didn't we kill off any members? At LEAST one of the big three (preferably Felicity) should have died and maybe two of the extra cast. 

To make things worse, they bring Slade back in S5. Yes, they bring the most badass character back to the show and then get rid of him in the first fucking episode?! Wild dog looks fucking ridiculous even though it's an improvement from before, and we can't escape the atrocity that is Laurel!

And then we get on to William, Oliver's son. Apparently, he's a 13 year old who says "bad man" as if he has the developmental capabilities of a fucking seven year old. Oh yeah, and Quentin is back to drinking because that's apparently his only character trait throughout five seasons!
The worst part is that no one is giving any respect to the previous season, and all I see is a fantastic show falling into disrepair. 

What a damn shame.

For years I have been perfecting the Do The Mario dance. I have managed to perfect the movements of a schizophrenic drunkard and perfectly sync it with music, however I have yet to discover the secret of Lou Albano's teleportation technique, I shall never complete my art if I cannot adopt his abilities. Has all of my hard work just been for nothing?

Somebody save me from the dark labyrinth I have lost myself in. It's cold, Lou Albano's voice taunts me, his words "just like that" echo constantly, he knows I have not perfected his sacred dance, I am a failure in his eyes.

God has left me unfinished.﻿

Shut the fuck up. I'm so tired of being disrespected on this goddamn website. All I wanted to do was post my opinion. MY OPINION. But no, you little bastards think it's "hilarious" to mock those with good opinions. My opinion. while not absolute, is definitely worth the respect to formulate an ACTUAL FUCKING RESPONSE AND NOT JUST A SHORT MEME OF A REPLY. I've been on this site for 6 months: 6 MONTHS and I have never felt this wronged. It boils me up that I could spend so much time thinking and putting effort into things while you shits sit around (probably jerking off to traps or whatever gay shit you like) and make fun of the intellectuals of this world. I've bored you? Good for fucking you. Literally no one cares that your little brain is to underdeveloped and rotted to comprehend my idea...MY GREAT GREAT IDEA. I could sit here all day whining, but I won't. I'm NOT a whiner. I'm a realist and an intellectual. I know when to call it quits and to leave the babybrains to themselves. I'm done with this goddamn site and you goddamn immature children. I have lived my life up until this point having to deal with memesters and idiots like you. I know how you work. I know that you all think you're "epik trolls" but you're not. You think you baited me? NAH. I've never taken any bait. This is my 100% real opinion divorced from anger. I'm calm, I'm serene. I LAUGH when people imply I'm intellectually low enough to take bait. I always choose to reply just to spite you. I won. I've always won. Losing is not in my skillset. So you're probably gonna reply "lol epik trolled" or "u mad bro" but once you've done that you've shown me I've won. I've tricked the trickster and conquered memery. I live everyday growing stronger to fight you plebs and low level trolls who are probably 11 (baby, you gotta be 18 to use 4chan). But whatever, I digress. It's just fucking annoying that I'm never taken serious on this site, goddamn.

Because i am superior than younger players. In more ways than one. The way i act, how i communicate, my hats/clothing, my skill in building, actually understanding what roblox is about.

A big one is plain and simple skill, knowing how to play roblox, knowing the optimal way to move your little robloxian around, how to absolutely destroy others, etc.

Watching newer players go through obbies is hilarious, they take forever, you can tell they all play in first person and they manage to die on the simplest challenges.

Playing any combat game i almost always dominate, and i dominate HARD. Ive gotten triple digit KDR's in many games. It is normal for me to be called a hacker every single game i play because i just wreck so hard.

And its a sad gratification as a 20 year old because i know im just some weird old dude playing a kids game to make himself feel good but honestly i dont care, its great.

Plain and simple, kids suck at games. I am better than them at games because im an oldfag with a lot of experience.

22 kill streak, and this wasnt even a good one, ive done way better on Armored Patrol, this is just the one i was able to find in my recent pictures on another site.

I actually saw Ryan Gosling at a Mercadona store in Girona yesterday. I told him how cool it was to meet him in person, but I didn’t want to be a douche and bother him and ask him for photos or anything. He said, “Oh, like you’re doing now?”

I was taken aback, and all I could say was “Huh?” but he kept cutting me off and going “huh? huh? huh?” and closing his hand shut in front of my face. I walked away and continued with my shopping, and I heard him chuckle as I walked off. When I came to pay for my stuff up front I saw him trying to walk out the doors with like fifteen Milky Ways in his hands without paying.

The girl at the counter was very nice about it and professional, and was like “Senor, you need to pay for those first.” At first he kept pretending to be tired and not hear her, but eventually turned back around and brought them to the counter.

When she took one of the bars and started scanning it multiple times, he stopped her and told her to scan them each individually “to prevent any electrical infetterence,” and then turned around and winked at me. I don’t even think that’s a word. After she scanned each bar and put them in a bag and started to say the price, he kept interrupting her by yawning really loudly.

you don't have to understand physics or deeply follow philosophy to find rick and morty funny. sure, you have to be well informed to get into the philosophy, but the humor itself is made around attracting mature audiences. they make alcoholism and and fart jokes every episode. you don't need to be a genius to understand basic plot progression. it's an over-exaggeration fans make, saying this show is somehow more intellectual than others. most of the science is spotty, and most "science" in the show is fiction anyways. hence the term, "science fiction satire." and is made to be understood by general audiences.
https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/59dba8/is-rick-and-morty-as-smart-as-its-fans-think-it-is
this show is amazing though. but don't think you are an elite human being because you watch it and understand most of the jokes.
also, don't use IQ tests to show your intelligence. it's overstated pseudoscience. that is known as the bandwagon effect. "a majority believe it is real, therefore it must be real."

I'm doing my 4th step for AA and I can't bring myself to tell this to another man face to face but I have to tell someone, I have to be fully honest or it'll negatively affect my sobriety and I'd be lying to my sponsor when I said I left nothing off, so I'm telling you. I have a tiny penis. About 2" fully erect. I'm afraid that I'll never satisfy a woman, never make her moan. No woman will ever see my dick and think I want that inside me. Im afraid that no woman will want to be with me after she sees my tiny pecker. I've avoided relationships with women out of fear for them seeing my dick and rejecting me. It greatly affects my pride and self-esteem.

To be fair, you have to have a very high IQ to understand Diwali. The celebrations are extremely subtle, and without a solid grasp of the history most of the festivities will go over a typical person’s head. There’s also the Ram’s nihilistic outlook, which is deftly woven into his work - his personal philosophy draws heavily from Vedic literature, for instance. The Bhakts understand this stuff; they have the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate the depths of these festivities, to realise that they’re not just holidays - they say something deep about LIFE. As a consequence people who dislike Diwali truly ARE idiots- of course they wouldn’t appreciate, for instance, the meaning in Lakshman’s existential catchphrase “I’ll cut your nose.” which itself is a cryptic reference to Vyasa’s Indian epic Mahabharat. I’m smirking right now just imagining one of those addlepated simpletons scratching their heads in confusion as Ram’s genius wit unfolds itself on their television screens. What fools.. how I pity them. 😂

And yes, by the way, i DO have a Hanuman tattoo. And no, you cannot see it. It’s for the ladies’ eyes only- and even then they have to demonstrate that they’re within 5 IQ points of my own (preferably lower) beforehand. Nothin personnel kid 😎

My true reason for becoming a mechanical engineer, is to work on VR. (My family knows this)
What they don't know is I want to create full dive VR for sexual reasons, to fuck monstergirls, to have sex with hundreds of women, to allow guys and girls to feel like the opposite gender, to try out sex as different creatures and genders, to create entire mmo's centered around it, and that I've had to resist the urge to in detail write down all the rules for said mmo.
I'm researching, learning and it will probably take decades of hard work. I'll learn programming, get my 4 year degree, maybe move to Canada for a 2 year degree in mechatronics, I'm fucking studying this and have personal heroes, ie, people that move my dream closer like Michael abrash (Oculus head scientist) and neuralink (Company working on brain machine interfaces).
I want to fuck, I want everyone to fuck and I want to allow everyone to do it however they can imagine.
I turned my horniness into ambition. And I'm always horny.

Rick and Morty fan here, and I totally know that feeling. I teach a few undergrad courses at a university, and don't get me wrong- I love my job! But I have an IQ of 158 and sometimes feel that my "resources" could be better allocated. Freshman ask me questions all day like "how do you draw the net vector of multiple superposed 3D vectors with a scientific calculator" and I don't mind pouring us a cuppa and kindly answering "you can't you fucking tard" but I'm an older man and it wears at me a little more than it used to.

Sometimes you just want to be wrong for once.

A think tank based in Uganda claims Hitler was of mixed-race - half black/half white. Allegedly Klara Hitler (Adolph's mother) visited Uganda (then known as British Protectorate of Uganda ) in August of 1888 to study primitive mythology. 

One day she was separated from her exploration party and taken into the jungle by thirty Ugandan hunters, given magic mushrooms, homemade alcohol (Kasese), and participated in a three day Banyarwanda tribal orgy. 

"According to many documents we discovered," program director Emmanuel Petelei told New Vision, Uganda's largest newspaper. "Klara Hitler quite enjoyed tribal orgy and wanted to stay in Uganda with the men indefinitely, but the Banyarwanda tribesman say no. So she go back to white person land." 

According to the group, Klara Hitler became pregnant with Adolph, but since she had multiple sex partners, the true genetic father cannot be traced, but the think tank has attributed her pregnancy to tribal chief Tittitsu Kananura. 

The group said Alois Hitler Hitler was not the true father of Adolph Hitler. 

"I don't know how white people are, but when you're black you can't help but feel your blackness," Petelei said. "He [Adolph Hitler] had to feel it, but knew he couldn't embrace his inner-Ugandan and this led to a deep racial divide in himself which manifested as racial hatred and wanting to kill his black half. He carried out his desire to kill his black half by exterminating Jewish people. It's possibly Klara Hitler told him his father was African. We don't know. But she obviously had to tell Mr. Hitter Sr. because of her baby bump and he had to say he was little Adolph's biological father to prevent shame from coming onto the family' 

The obvious question: Why didn't Adolph Hitler look mixed race? 

"We don't know," Petelei said."We think he could have been born with Anglo features and black skin, mabye his mother possibly bleached his skin to be white when he was tiny baby. She would obviously take great measures to hide the fact that she had sex orgy with many black men."

The RickAndMortyGram™ Pickle Test is a multistage IQ test that progressively gets more difficult as it continues. The very high IQ test will begin in 30 seconds. Line up at the squanching line. The difficulty squanches slowly, but goes higher over a typical viewer's head each minute after you hear this signal.  “Wubba Lubba Dub Dub” A solid grasp of theoretical physics should be demonstrated each time you hear this sound. "I TURNED MYSELF INTO A PICKLE MORTY! I'M PICKLE RICK!" Remember Rick's nihilistic outlook, and worship Dan Harmon's genius wit as long as possible. The second time you fail to grasp the extremely subtle humour before the sound, your test is over. The test will begin on the word squanch. On your mark, get ready, squanch!

I happily slam the condoms down on the counter along with a couple bottles of gatorade and a box of tylenol. 

then i make finger guns at the cashier and high five everyone on my way out as they all cheer for me 

When i get to my car, someone in the parking lot hands me their keys to their mercedes and offers to let me take their wife 

On my way to my gfs house, police cars pull up next to me in my new mercedes and give me an escort so i go really fast

Arriving at my gfs house with my new wife ready for a threesome i realize that Slash has shown up to play sick guitar solos while i bang the night away

The next day i quit my job and bill gates offers me his fortune to play videogames for a living

My new wife brings home her female yoga coach and take turns blowing me while i play call of duty and eat doritos

Just when i think it couldnt get any wilder my gf walks in and tells me to open the door, get on the floor, everybody walk the dinosaur

To be faiw, you have to have a vewy high IQ to undewstand Wick and Mowty. The humouw is extwemewy subtwe, and without a sowid gwasp of theoweticaw physics most of the jokes wiww go uvw a typicaw viewew’s head. Thewe’s awso Wick’s nyihiwistic outwook, which is deftwy wuvn into his chawactewisation- his pewsonyaw phiwosophy dwaws heaviwy fwom Nyawodnyaya Vowya witewatuwe, fow instance. The fans undewstand this stuff; they have the intewwectuaw capacity to twuwy appweciate the depths of these jokes, to weawise that they’we nyot just funny- they say something deep about WIFE. As a consequence peopwe who diswike Wick & Mowty twuwy AWE idiots- of couwse they wouwdn’t appweciate, fow instance, the humouw in Wick’s existentiaw catchphwase “Wubba Wubba Dub Dub,” which itsewf is a cwyptic wefewence to Tuwgenyev’s Wussian epic Fathews and Sons. I’m smiwking wight nyow just imaginying onye of those addwepated simpwetons scwatching theiw heads in confusion as Dan Hawmon’s genyius wit unfowds itsewf on theiw tewevision scweens. What foows.. how I pity them. xD

And yes, by the way, i DO have a Wick & Mowty tattoo. And nyo, you cannyot see it. It’s fow the wadies’ eyes onwy- and even then they have to demonstwate that they’we within 5 IQ points of my own (pwefewabwy wowew) befowehand. Nyothin pewsonnyew kid UwU

To be fair, you have to have a very high IQ to understand Richard Spencer. The humor is extremely subtle, and without a solid grasp of european history most of the jokes will go over a typical viewer's head. There's also Dick's identitarian views, which is deftly woven into his characterisation - his personal philosophy draws heavily from Evola literature, for instance. The fans understand this stuff; they have the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate the depths of these jokes, to realize that they're not just funny- they say something deep about LIFE. As a consequence people who dislike Richard Spencer truly ARE idiots- of course they wouldn't appreciate, for instance, the humour in Dick's existencial catchphrase "Homosexuality is an implicit last stand of white identity," which itself is a cryptic reference to W.L. Pierce's epic Lemmings I'm smirking right now just imagining one of those addlepated simpletons scratching their heads in confusion as the alt Right's genius unfolds itself on their college campus. What fools... how I pity them. 😂 And yes by the way, I DO have a plan for an ethnostate. And no, you cannot see it. It's for the ladies' eyes only- And even they have to demonstrate that they're within 5 purity points of my own (preferably higher) beforehand.

Mints are addictive. Specifically the winter green lifesaver mints. First you have one, thinking hey this is pretty neat. Before you know it, you’re ordering $10 bags of mints from Amazon once a week, you’re popping mints one after another, and you still have enough to hand out to everyone you see at school. You build up a reputation as the Mint Guy and you’ve gained respect from students and teachers because of your mint dealings. Soon enough, your addiction shows its bad side by making your tongue yellow. You try googling why your tongue is yellow, hoping it has nothing to do with the mints. You can’t find anything relating mints and yellow tongue on the internet, but you know deep down that it’s because of your mint addiction. You have to stop eating mints and scrub your tongue with mouthwash for 10 mins everyday. After 5 months, you’re offered a mint. You’ve been clean all this time but you figure one wouldn’t hurt. That one mint lead to another and before you know it your tongue is yellow again, but the mints help you focus. You NEED them. You’re in college now and consider yourself forced to start popping mints again so you could focus on your work, even though you know it’s unhealthy. Only time will tell where this goes, and you pray you find a healthier alternative. Rehab isn’t an option because society doesn’t realize the danger posed by this “candy”. You just have to come to terms with the fact that you’ll have to scrub your tongue religiously from now on. Don’t do mints, kids. They’ll ruin your life in the long run.

I unironically want to murder /pol/acks. I meet one, I will not hesitate to confront him physically. All that sick, sick shit I've seen posted on here and all the propagandizing spread throughout the internet creating young fascists is probably among THE most disgusting destructive things in the world right now. You are hurting people, you are ridiculing people's struggles and making them a joke. I saw someone vandalize an anarchist poster today downtown and write /pol/ over it. I wish I took a picture, but man. It made my blood boil that these people are in my city in real life spreading this bullshit website to the public. They're lurking out there in REAL FUCKING LIFE and we don't know who they are, but they're spreading their toxic shit. These people need a good fucking kick in the head. They need a taste of their own medicine. Hanging in the street isn't fucking good enough for a fascist, they need more. I fucking detest and spit on all of you, I hope you know that. You are worth less than shit on shoes to me, you don't even qualify as human because you are so inhuman with your callousness and hateful rhetoric. You have no empathy, no emotion, you don't care about the consequences, you just have a desire to anger people. You're fucking worthless and beyond redemption. I want to see you all in cold fucking blood on the side of the road fucking face stomped with your guts and eyes spilling over onto the pavement. I want to hang you with your fucking intestines and make your parents watch. I want you to see your sister and mothers raped by the minorites you hate so much while you wriggle in pain gasping for your last breath. You are human scum and the world won't miss you.

I don't write articles or journals. I'm more of a "Matrix  mechanic". That is, I see everything as being algorithmic in that there is dynamic order to things, which is why memory seems to function as it does for example. I could spend hours breaking these ideas down and justifying assumptions, but there's no time here.

I know for a fact free will can't have been defined because the ontological nature of the Universe isn't understood, the mathematical model is incomplete, mathematics can not yet account for consciousness (though it should in principle given its apparently (to itself) ordered nature), and any correlative neurological dynamics of free will are not identified.

Moreover, free will must have order or structure to it otherwise it would get an organism killed. So whatever free will is, it must have mathematical properties.

Has this fact ever been noted in any of the expert definitions you've encountered? Not to mention - how does a coherent, mathematically based phenomenon like free will manifest coherently through spacetime?

Did the philosophers figure that out?

But, I don't write papers. I just break things. I dismantle philosophy, psychology, psychiatry, law, education, economics, etc.

The human species is functionally psychotic, which is easy to see once you can see through language games and how language doesn't really map to many actual processes. It's just tribal glue. This makes a lot of philosophy trivial to break.

Ever since I was young I tried to "see the matrix" - so everything is just patterns to me. Even thought is just evolving "memetic" infection, and humans are generally blind to this fact. Also, there is no "me" - ego habits no longer run in this brain, you could say, but "ego-attention" mechanisms still fire. They're just observed and quickly dissipated, usually with meta-cognitive annoyance at how irritating our evolved "social-glue" mechanisms are.

Human beings are just running faulty algorithms, so I want them reprogrammed, which is more than metaphor when you think about it.

This message is for anyone in concern. I'm a supporter of Donald Trump. I love him and his very intelligent family. And this is like Forbes Magazine are in conspiracy to break this man financially, it seems. Donald Trump has more money than he ever had. So Forbes making noise about some three point something billion is fake news and therefore Forbes is on the drain-the-swamp list. Steve Bannon will make sure magazines and businesses like you will go down because Donald Trump is very intelligent, very handsome. His children are very beautiful, very handsome. They have the highest IQs than any racist or anybody in this county. And we love him, and he will continue to run this country, and his children will too. So fuck Forbes Magazine, and you can stick that fake news up your ass.

I was only twenty-nine years old. I loved Rick and Morty so much, I had all the merchandise and movies. I'd pray to Rick and Morty every night before I go to bed, thanking for the life I've been given. "Rick is love", I would say, "Morty is life". My dad hears me and calls me a faggot. I knew he was just jealous for my devotion of Rick and Morty. I called him a cunt. He slaps me and sends me to go to sleep. I'm crying now and my face hurts. I lay in bed and it's really cold. A warmth is moving towards me. I feel something touch me. It's Rick and Morty. I'm so happy. They whisper in my ears, "Pickle Rick". He grabs me with his powerful scienctist hands, and puts me on my hands and knees. I spread my ass-cheeks for Rick and Morty. They penetrate my butthole. It hurts so much, but I do it for Rick and Morty. I can feel my butt tearing and my as my eyes start to water. I push against their force. I want to please Rick and Morty. Rick roars a mighty roar and Morty a whimper, as they fill my butt with their love. My dad walks in. Rick looks him straight in the eye, and says, "Pickle Rick". Rick and Morty leave through my window. Rick is love. Morty is life.﻿

Are you roasting me? If so there are 3 solutions to this issue:

1. Go hide in a corner for the rest of your life so there is a .01 percent chance I don't get you.

2. Run away forever so you have a chance if talking again.

3. Beg and do whatever I want before I start the cleansing at midnight.

Activision files a patent for microtransactions in matchmaking, Microtransactions and lootboxes everywhere, Nintendo is just doing neat quality of life upgrades. The distribution "issues" you guys have aside, you're all beacon of hope for the gaming industry. Nintendo will keep doing Nintendo, while everyone else buries their companies in garbage. I play a lot of games, exclusively on PC and Switch now, since exclusives are kind of a dead thing now, but coming back to your games time after time always reminds me of being a child, being young and impressionable, and without worry. I've had a lot of death in my close immediate family the past few years, and Breath of the Wild and the new Metroid brings me back to simpler times, and I have the promise of playing through all these classic games with my son in a couple years, as he's only three now. I am also a retro collector as well so I have a ton of NES and SNES games he'll be able to experience as well, if he wants. I know this the most random thing to post on such a small video like this, completely out of left field, but I think the thought just hit me like a ton of bricks suddenly, rofl.  Keep it up, thank you for all the years of fun, and don't mess this chance to be on top again up.﻿

Mickey D's has taken the trophy for my friends and my hangout for the past few years. By Mickey D's, I mean that place where all the fatasses go after school to hang out: McDonald's chain burger restaurant. Starting since the fifth grade, I've ventured to McDonald's many times as my go-to place. Whether it be just to write an essay, read a book, or even recover after a beating from my parents, McDonald's has supported me throughout many events in my life. Though, it wasn't until the fifth grade until I realized why I wanted to go to McDonalds so bad. It was a rainy day, and I had just taken my first practice ACT, in preparation for my standardized testing four years from then. The gutters were clogged, trees had blown over, and I was biking down the road towards the two shining, yellow arcs consisting the logo of my sanctum.

I saw Jeff Kaplan at a grocery store in Santa Ana yesterday. I told him how cool it was to meet him in person, but I didn’t want to be a douche and bother him and ask him for photos or anything.

He said, “Oh, like you’re doing now?”
I was taken aback, and all I could say was “Huh?” but he kept cutting me off and going “huh? huh? huh?” and closing his hand shut in front of my face. I walked away and continued with my shopping, and I heard him chuckle as I walked off. When I came to pay for my stuff up front I saw him trying to walk out the doors with like fifteen Milky Ways in his hands without paying.

The girl at the counter was very nice about it and professional, and was like “Sir, you need to pay for those first.” At first he kept pretending to be tired and not hear her, but eventually turned back around and brought them to the counter.
When she took one of the bars and started scanning it multiple times, he stopped her and told her to scan them each individually “to prevent any electrical infetterence,” and then turned around and winked at me. I don’t even think that’s a word. After she scanned each bar and put them in a bag and started to say the price, he kept interrupting her by yawning really loudly.

Looks accurate. 
Africa having no computers or electricity would be awesome along with that other invention called the internet could mean I would have 98.7% less email scams coming from Nigeria.
I guess you would lose more infants and kids with the lack of modern medicines to inoculate and even completely eradicate some diseases. Of course you would still have to hack each other up in your periodical tribal wars and genocides with primitive tools rather than modern weaponry and not to mention the slavery that was rampant would make a come-back. Democracy would not exist (although for the most part you fuck that up in Africa too) 
Agricultural advances that took Africans from a very basic agrarian/ hunter gatherer society into the modern world would be set back so you would be at the mercy of periodical famines. Of course ALL the scientific advances would mean your education and knowledge of the wider universe would be limited.

Enjoy!

Babaji is a very high spirit a la Christ and Krishna. He's less known because he didn't have a public or a mission like Christ and Krishna. He's kind of like the back room boy. He runs the universe and he runs everything. He's an unbelievable spirit or force on God. He is God really... a manifestation of God. He's had a physical form for hundreds of years. He doesn't have to eat anything. He inhabits the Himalayas with a small band of disciples. He's a legend in India but he's lesser known in the west. I don't know, talking about him kind of lessens him somehow. It's weird. It really is fascinating.

Literally all day I've been looking up about incubuses and humans being raped/ molested by ghosts and spirits and that's why happened to me last night. My moms spirit and I had intercourse. And the crazy part is, it was the best I've ever had. She took me to a whole different level of turned on. Like I was actually being touched and aroused by a disembodied soul. And I even came. So did she. But it's weird because ghost rape takes place INSIDE your body. The spirit actually invades your body as a surrogate and fucks your insides. It's the most intense, most erotic, most passionate, most pleasing, most amazing night of my life. My moms ghost initiated sex with her oldest son. If that doesn't prove she loved me and wanted nothing more than happiness and pleasure in my life, idk what does.

There is totally no point of playing rankeds right now. You dont get anything for progressing expect u re top 500 and get a nice sticker. Report system completly is not working and people know that good enough to don't care and troll or grief a few games in a row. The only thing you can get banned for is FLAMING which is ridcilous, if I meet flamers they mostly don't flame for no reason. This people gets crazy about someone trolling or losing on purpose, and later on the flamer gets chat restricted and troll gets NOTHING. Im playing on diamond/masters level, in 10 games one is normal, when neither mine or enemy team don't have 4 dps or a tjorborn in attack or a mei blocking her team, I don't even wanna think about what is it like on lower ranks. It's not even fun to win vs trolls and of course it's not fun to lose because of trolls, this people are not scared to troll because they are untouchable. We need that league of legend's system that u have to choose your role BEFORE the game and cant swap for any other. That might crush the meta, but blizzard needs to create the meta so we get balanced matches where healer doesnt swap for a mei when he doesnt like someone in his team. We need better rewards for climbing the elo system, Special skins, better sprays that shows what rank we got in last season etc.
Everything is wrong about current rank system , why do you think people come back to overwatch when there is a event like haloween? Because there is NOT any other reason to play for most people, rankeds are supposed to be fun.

Can a man be Jewish and Christian at the same time? It just sounds like an oxymoron.? Three big earthquakes will shake the three superpowers; 1st big earthquake in Russia; 2nd (bigger one) in China; 3rd (biggest of the three) will be in America. NATO will nuke Ukraine to blame Russia for it; then NATO will nuke Russia from Scandinavia. China will attack Russia; but will not get past Ural Mountains; bio-genetic weapon will be used against Chinese soldiers (they will run back to China and hide in closets in fear) and weather weapon will freeze Siberia to - 200 Celcius; stadium-size chunks of unmeltable ice will fall from the lower sky (because when rockets go into higher sky they bring this ice down to lower sky). Russia will destroy Turkey and America. China will have a hole across the whole country to the abyss (because of another super weapon used to stop Chinese aggression); radiation from this hole will be massive; Chinese will try to keep quiet about it; a lot of people will fall into this hole. 
Scientists don't see dinosaurs because of radiation. Only Eurasia and Alaska (both without coasts) will remain after demons blow up Antarctica (which surrounds the flat earth) and Greenland melts. Move to Ural Mountains or inland Alaska. Sionists want war between Russia and Germany over Serbia from June to October on their holidays because (666 times 3)+(6 times 3) = 2016 (in their twisted logic). 
Tube people = demons. Clones = demons. Human costumes that demons wear = demons. Dinosaurs and 666ed people have triple stranded DNA; normal person can't swallow 666ed food (designed for 666ed people). Demons live inside clones. Bacteriologist Alexandre Yersin (who discovered Bubonic plague) is depicted on the Shroud of Turin. There is another shroud on which blasphemer Yosef (who was crucified on a pole in 1066 AD) is depicted. Menachem Mendel Schneerson, Lenin (el=deity in Hebrew, nine = no in German; so, when chanted repeatedly is blasphemy against the Creator), and Yosef were possessed by Azazel; now, Rico Cortes is possessed by Azazel. 
WW3 happens; 7% of people will be left; after people are tired of war, they will elect the antichrist as one world leader; don't vote. ISIS stands for Israeli Secret Intelligence Service. Next false flag: Statue of Liberty in order to attack Iran; one big shake, one giant step forward, one giant collapse. Move away from coasts as nukes will go off in the ocean (at where tectonic plates meet; result: megatsunamis 1km high). 
Wear natural clothing so that if a bomb goes off it won't stick to the body as fast as synthetic clothes. All metal will be burned for fuel; so, save knives, crowbars, shovels, wood-burning stoves, etc. Also, save cloth/fabric/textile to cover the wounds and diseases. 
Eat natural food because nanochips, cells of aborted fetuses, bug DNA, and other poisons are in food that is commonly sold; reject vaccines, medical care, medicine, etc. because nanochips are administered thru IVs, implants, fillings, etc. If 1000-1500 nanochips are in your right hand, then you can't make proper Orthodox sign of the cross with the right hand; last mercy for you then will be to cut the hand off. 
Seraphim of Sarov and Sergiy of Radonezh will be resurrecred after WW3 for a short time; Seraphim of Sarov will show the new Ruski Tsar who will fight the antichrist for about 2 years and 8 months. Those who go see Seraphim of Sarov will be healed of their infirmities/illnesses/sicknesses/ diseases; if you want to see him then, hurry because he won't stay longer than a few weeks. 
Earth is flat; stands on 3 pillars (the Most Holy Trinity); pillars stand on water at zero Kelvin. Zodiac is planetary prison of demons; don't believe in horoscopes or you'll exhibit the traits of the trapped demons. Most thoughts and dreams are from demons; demons never do good. Sleep fully clothed; pray the Jesus prayer. Pray to your guardian angel to have normal sleep. 
Humans were created about 7525 years ago. Ruski Orthodox Christian Vyacheslav Krasheninnikov was the last prophet before Enoch and Elijah return to preach against the antichrist. 
Birds participate in time creation. It's a sin to kill birds. Dinosaurs live under our level. They will get out through sinkholes and lakes. To kill them, go for their nerves. Save the birds; but kill the dinosaurs. First dinosaur will come out of Volga River in Russia. 
Demons grow human skin (from a sample taken during abduction) and put it on so as to look like us. Demons will invite people to be healed inside their UFOs; those who go will be like zombies after. Gov't provides demons with diamonds and allows demons to abduct people. If you're being abducted, slowly pray the Jesus prayer. 

Don't panic. Demons use diamonds and souls to power their UFO craft. The bigger the diamond, the more it lasts. Demons have 4 UFO bases: 1)Moon 2)Inside fake mountain Kailash in Tibet 3)In lake Baikal in Russia 4)In Atlantis which is underneath the Mariana Trench in Pacific Ocean. There are no aliens. Nobody lives on other planets. 
Airplanes that go down are hit by demons because they need the airspace to fight Jesus. Antichrist is pale with red eyes. He's possessed by Satan since he's 12 years old. He flies. He wears gloves to hide long nails. He's surrounded by demons who appear as angels of light. 

Don't go into a UFO to be healed by demons. Green 666 is given by isotope rays on wrist or forehead when people stretch hands to receive small plastic grey card with no name on it (World Passport). Police will microchip and isotope ray people on the highways. Microchipped people will be influenced by computers to take grey plastic card; but when they do, 666 is given. Food stores will isotope ray people too. Antichrist will also release prisoners to mark people. Reject 666 at all cost because it leads to permanent hell. 
If you're about to be marked, pray the Jesus prayer. Hide with Orthodox Christians to escape 666; leave all electronics behind so that antichrist's minions can't track you. Give to charity in the name of Archangel Michael; he rescues people from temporary hell twice a year (or brings them up a level, that is, to a level with less punishment; eventually, people are freed). Feed the pigeons; when pigeons bow down, people are saved from temporary hell. Forgive me

Because they hate Trump. Evil Fascist Tyrant Blurnald Blurmpff stood at the office window on the highest floor of his Dark Tower. As he gazed down at the street below, a look of satisfaction spread across his swine-like face, his tiny hands clawing maniacially, gleefully at the Jew-skin coat draping his bloated form. "Those fools!" he cackled, drawing forth from his pocket a twisted bone pipe, fashioned from the remains of his murdered archenemy, Hillary the Virtuous. "They trusted me! They gave all this to me!" His cackling grew louder, more shrill and hysterical, as he spastically waved the pipe at the window, drawing an arc across the entire vista of New York - and America - which now belonged to him. "They'll regret the day they ever trusted Blurnald Blurmpff! Wait'll they see what I'm gonna do with those shifty Mexicans!" A smug, hideous grin creased his cracked, purplish lips as he stuffed the pipe into his mouth, lighting it up to take a long, deep puff of powdered heroin. It was then, though, that his piggish, bloodshot eyes spotted something going on down on the street below. What was that? He leaned closer to the glass, squinting- and, as it came into focus, his blood ran cold. For down on the cold, hard streets of New York beneath his Tower, a family stood... a brave family, clearly members of the underground Resistance, courageously signalling their displeasure with Blurmpff's malevolence by giving he and his tower the finger! "No!" screamed Blurmpff, the pipe tumbling from his lips and scattering ash across his deep-pile rug. "No!" Fearfully, panic coursing through his cholesterol-clogged veins, he backed away from the window. "They've foiled my evil plans yet again! Damn them! Damn them all to hell!" Wide-eyed, almost delirious with terror, Blurmpff scooped up several tubs of ice cream from his desk and trotted as fast as his stubby legs could take him out of his office and up to the roof's helipad. As he started up his customised SS-black chopper and began to speed away through the neon-lit skies, Blurmpff gazed down at the city, a scowl twisting his already hideous features into a gross, distorted caricature. "Curse you, Resistance!" he howled at the figures on the street below, who were now bravely giving the finger to his fleeing helicopter. "You may have won this round, but I'll be back! NOBODY gets the best of Blurnald Blurmpff!"

MOTHERFUCKING SHIT. I WAS JUST MASTURBATING AND EVERYTHING WAS GOING GREAT. I WAS IN MY ROOM, I HAD MY HEADPHONES ON, I WAS TOTALLY NAKED SITTING AT MY COMPUTER FAPPING AWAY TO A VIDEO ON REDTUBE. ALL OF A SUDDEN THERE'S THIS REALLY SHARP PAIN IN MY DICK, LIKE IT JUST GOT STABBED WITH A SEWING NEEDLE. I JERKED MY HAND BACK AND IT BUMPED INTO MY COMPUTER TOWER, WHICH SITS ON THE DESK. WELL, I HAD MY STICK OF DEODORANT ON TOP OF THE TOWER, AND THAT BITCH FELL OFF AND LANDED DEODORANT-END-DOWN ON THE HEAD OF MY COCK. HOLY FUCKING SHIT DID THAT HURT, AND ON TOP OF THAT IT HIT SO HARD THAT IT ACTUALLY FORCED SOME DEODORANT INTO MY URETHRA. I'VE NEVER HAD ANYTHING BURN SO BAD IN MY ENTIRE LIFE. I JUMPED OUT OF MY FUCKING CHAIR AND STOOD UP BECAUSE IT HURT SO BAD; THIS CAUSED MY HEADPHONE CABLE TO GET YANKED OUT OF MY SPEAKERS, WHICH CAUSED "OH YEAH BABY COME DEEP IN MY TIGHT TEEN ASSHOLE UH UH UH" TO GET BLARED THROUGH MY FUCKING HOUSE AND ALMOST MAXIMUM VOLUME. NOW MY EYES ARE WATERING FROM THE PAIN OF THE DEODORANT INSIDE MY COCK BUT I MANAGE TO PUNCH ONE OF MY SPEAKERS HARD ENOUGH SO THEY TURN OFF. I LOOKED DOWN AND NOTICED BLOOD DRIPPING OFF OF MY COCK; I GUESS THE LIP OF THE PLASTIC DEODORANT THING BIT INTO MY FORESKIN AS IT CONNECTED WITH MY COCK. THE BLOOD WAS DRIPPING DOWN MY LEG. THIS ALL HAPPENED IN THE SPACE OF MAYBE 6 SECONDS. IT MAY SEEM BAD BUT IT GETS WORSE. JUST AS I'M STANDING THERE TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHAT THE FUCK HAPPENED, MY BEDROOM DOOR FUCKING OPENS. MY DAD WAS STANDING THERE WITH MY ACCEPTANCE LETTER TO JOHNS HOPKINS. I FROZE AND HE STARED AT ME, NAKED WITH MY BLOODY ERECTION FOR MAYBE 15 SECONDS BEFORE HE NOTICED MY COMPUTER MONITOR AND THE BRUTAL ANAL SEX SCENE GOING ON FULL-SCREEN. HE IMMEDIATELY CLOSED THE DOOR AND LEFT WITHOUT SAYING ANYTHING. THIS MAY SEEM EMBARRASSING BUT MY DAD IS A SERIOUSLY CONSERVATIVE CHRISTIAN. THIS HAPPENED ABOUT 15 MINUTES AGO AND HE HASN'T SAID ANYTHING TO ME YET. I'M STILL IN MY ROOM TRYING TO GET THE GOD DAMN FUCKING OLD SPICE OUT OF MY COCK. WHAT SHOULD I DO?﻿

Nothing is wrong with weakness. Eventually, we all are/will be weak once in our life times. What even is weakness? A pathetic word. Weakness is a taunt, not a word. What do you get called when you cant lift a pencil? You get called weak. How about when you can't drink bleach? Weak. Or when you can't run into the pedo neighbor's house and pull down your pants for him to give you his juicy cock? Weak. Sometimes lifting a pencil is hard.. Sometimes drinking bleach is hard.. Sometimes getting fucked by the pedo neighbor is hard.. But we can do it! We can lift that pencil. We can drink bleach. We can get raped by our pedo neighbor. We can! Getting called weak pushes us away from that motivation. We are able to do all the things we are told we can't do. Sometimes we have to say fuck it and fuck the shit out of your grandpa. You just gotta do it. If you can't, it's okay. You won't be called weak, but instead a pussy. You're a pussy.. we all are pussies. It's okay to be a pussy. Don't be a dick though because dicks are gay. We don't like gay. We like Pedo neighbors and fucking grandpas.﻿

HA! a classic use of satire, that whole show sheds light on the flaw in macs thinking, believing he's a good person because of his christianity. The more Christian he is, the more bloody and brutal the depiction of christ is, the more righteous and "good" he is in the eyes of god, but that's a subjective viewpoint and doesn't necessarily equate to being a moral human being.

Just like when Charlie thinks he's a genius because he takes a drug and starts trying to do science. 

That show can be deeper than people expect!

To be fair, you have to have a *very* high IQ to play junkrat. His grenades require insane skill to connect, and without a solid grasp of theoretical physics most of the shots  will go over the enemy player's heads. There's also Junkrat's chaotic outlook, which is deftly woven into his characterisation- his personal philosophy draws heavily from *Narodnaya Volya* literature, for instance. The fans understand this stuff; they have the intellectual capacity to truly *appreciate* the depths of his character, to realise that they're not just funny- that he says something deep about LIFE. As a consequence people who dislike Junkrat truly ARE idiots- of course they wouldn't appreciate, for instance, the humour in Junkrat's absolutely inspiring catchphrase "If at first you don't succeed, blow it up again!" which itself is a cryptic reference to Katya Volskaya's Russian epic *Fathers and Sons.* I'm smirking right now just *imagining* one of those addlepated simpletons scratching their heads in confusion as Jeff Kaplan's genius sense of character design unfolds itself on their computer screens. What fools.. how I *pity* them. 😂

And yes, by the way, i DO have a Junkers tattoo. And no, you cannot see it. It's for my mercy girlfriend's eyes only- and even then they have to demonstrate that they're within 50 SR points of my own (preferably lower) beforehand.

Obi-Wan doesn't need to be on the high ground, the high ground just needs to exist within the battle; Obi-Wan knows that when he has the low ground, he really has the high ground, from a certain point of view. Look at his battle record: Maul: Has low ground, wins Dooku: No high ground, loses Dooku rematch: No high ground, loses Greivous: Has low ground, wins Vader: Has high ground, wins Vader rematch: No high ground, loses Obi-Wan with the high/low ground is canonically the most powerful Jedi. This is fact. Had Yoda not denied his request to battle The Senate with typical Jedi arrogance, Obi-Wan could have defeated Palpatine in the Senate building, which housed a variety of different altitudes; this was designed so that the Chancellor could always have the moral high ground in political debates. But Obi-wan didn't fight The Senate, and Yoda soon learned that you can't cleave the Sheev in a normal 1v1. Yoda is shorter than virtually every other fighter, which gives him a permanent low-ground disadvantage; however, his saber-fighting style utilizes a flipping-heavy technique in order to negate this weakness for a temporary window. You'll notice that, as he falls from the central podium in The Senate's building, he immediately retreats, knowing that he can never hold the high ground in this duel. You'll also notice that, while training Luke, he rides on him like a mount, to gain the intellectual high ground and accelerate Luke's training. As we all know, spinning is a good trick. However, only the Chosen one can spin outside of a starfighter. Palpatine tried spinning, but he lost due to this technique (but this was intentional, as losing gave him the emotional high ground when Anakin arrived). The reason for this is that spinning provides a yin-yang approach to combat (based in Eastern philosophy on balance), giving the spinner the high ground from above and below. Only the Chosen One can master the spin, as it is their destiny to maintain balance in the universe. This is why Obi-Wan was so emotional after defeating Vader on Mustafar; he expected to lose the high ground to the spin, but Anakin fell to the dark side and ceased to be the brother he knew, who could no longer use his signature trick. Anakin doesn't hate sand for the reasons he told Padme; all Jedi hate sand, as the battlefield can rapidly change between low and high ground on multiple vectors, so your perspective must be from a certain three-dimensional point of view in order to comprehend who holds the high ground. This is the only reason why Obi-Wan killed Maul in Rebels. This is also why Obi-Wan hates flying; there is no gravity in space, therefore there is no high or low ground from any frame of reference. In ANH, Vader proves his newfound mastery by engaging Obi on perfectly even ground. However, Obi-Wan intentionally sacrifices himself on the Death Star, so that he could train Luke from a higher plane of existence, thereby giving him the metaphysical high ground. (Why was Vader so invested in the construction and maintenance of the Death Star? Because he knows Obi-wan can't have the high ground if there's no ground left.) In Return of the Jedi, you can see that the Throne Room contains a variety of different altitudes; Palpatine placed these there to ensure Vader's defeat. However, Sheev failed to realize that his weakness was no ground, and should have covered that gaping pit which does nothing. In conclusion, Obi-wan abuses spatial relativity and Taoist doctrine in order to always invoke his high-ground powers.

To be fair, you have to have a very high IQ to understand Dad Jokes. The humor is extremely subtle, and without a solid grasp of theoretical deck building most of the jokes will go over a typical offspring's head. There's also your Dad's grilling, which is deftly woven into his characterisation - his personal philosophy draws heavily from How to build a Deck literature, for instance. The fans understand this stuff; they have the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate the depths of these jokes, to realize that they're not just funny- they say something deep about LIFE. As a consequence people who dislike Dad Jokes truly ARE idiots- of course they wouldn't appreciate, for instance, the humour in my Dad's existencial catchphrase "Toucan play at that game" which itself is a cryptic reference to an epic named Fathers and Sons . I'm smirking right now just imagining one of those addlepated simpletons scratching their heads in confusion as Dad's genius unfolds itself on their decks and couches. What fools... how I pity them. 😂 And yes by the way, I DO have a Dad Joke tattoo. And no, you cannot see it. It's for the dads' eyes only- And even they have to demonstrate that they're within 5 IQ points of my own (preferably lower) beforehand.

Fat people are both physically repulsive and mentally inferior. The ONLY WAY to become fat is if you eat too much food and don't exercise. It's literally the only way to gain weight; take in more calories than you burn. Thus, fat people are not only physically inferior and less attractive than fit people, but they are also MENTALLY inferior, as they are unable to control themselves and unable to dedicate themselves to self improvement. ALL FAT PEOPLE ARE LAZY, GLUTTONOUS, AND GREEDY. 

There is nothing good about being fat. It should be ridiculed. If you disagree, then answer this: why should men have to like/date fat girls, but girls shouldn't have to like/date short guys?﻿

To be fair, you have to have a very high IQ to understand Catholicism. The theology is extremely subtle, and without a solid grasp of early church Christianity most of the rituals will go over a typical protestant’s head. There’s also the traditionalist outlook, which is deftly woven into a Catholic’s characterisation- their personal philosophy draws heavily from the Bible, for instance. The Catholics understand this stuff; they have the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate the depths of Christianity, to realise that they’re not just Christians- they are the CHURCH. As a consequence people who dislike Catholicism truly ARE idiots- of course they wouldn’t appreciate, for instance, the authority in the Pope’s existential catchphrase “ex cathedra,” which itself is a cryptic reference to the authority of God. I’m smirking right now just imagining one of those addlepated simpletons scratching their heads in confusion as Saint Peter’s genius wit unfolds itself in scripture. What fools.. how I pity them. 😂

And yes, by the way, i DO have a Lady of Fatima tattoo. And no, you cannot see it. It’s for the ladies’ eyes only- and even then they have to demonstrate that they’re within 5 indulgences of my own (preferably lower) beforehand. Nothin personnel kid 😎

You'll probably just want to keep this set on repeat and play with yourself while you watch.

Attention Please !

I shall be coming to your country for an official meeting on Monday and i shall be bringing your Fund of $15.5m along with me but this time i will not go through Custom because as an Ambassador to Republic Du Benin, I am a US GOVERNMENT AGENT and i have the veto power to go through Custom.

As soon as i am through with my meeting i shall then proceed to your registered house address with your Consignment Fund. Without missing words, I am convinced 100% that you have had bitter experience with various 'scam claiming to be high government officials and thereby defrauding you of your 'hard-earned money'. The activities of these scam has changed your perspective about conducting business on the internet, and you now believed there is no genuine business that can be conducted on the internet. Well, I am an American and the internet was created by Americans for the purpose of creating awareness for your products/services and conducting genuine business with ease.

I am fully committed to deliver the "diplomatic consignment" to you at your door step within 48hours in order to differentiate myself from the many Benin Republic, Nigeria and other government officials you have dealt with.

I am a full citizen of the United States, but I was on a Foreign Mission here in Benin as a US Ambassador. Hence, I am making every effort to ensure that no citizen of the United States and other part of the world is cheated by Benin Republic. Therefore, I need your utmost support and understanding to actualize this dream. I also want you to understand that I do trust you and I expect you to show me the same trust and respect in return since trust is a 2-way street.

On the other hand, trust is a relationship of reliance. Trust also means being able to predict what other people will do and what situations will occur. Trust is both an emotional and logical act. Emotionally, it is where you expose your vulnerabilities to people, but believing they will not take advantage of your openness. Logically, it is where you have assessed the probabilities of gain and loss, calculating expected utility based on hard performance data,and concluded that the person in question will behave in a predictable manner.

In practice, trust is a bit of both. I trust you because I have experienced your trustworthiness by merely believing in what I have said, even when you have not seen me, and because I have faith in human nature. Frankly speaking, I understand that anyone in your shoes will feel betrayed, but I still want you to show me your trust by giving me the benefit of doubt on this delivery arrangement. My identity and personality is verifiable, and I promise to deliver the consignment to you safely without any hitch. Please do not allow this mission to die off because the registration fee of your Consignment Trunk Box which is $50 US Dollars, I meant so well for you and I believe you will appreciate me more when you have finally received your partial payment of $15,500.000.00 US Dollars upon my arrival with the package at your nominated address.

I will use my position and personality to deposit the $15,500.000.00 USD into your bank account without questioning from the financial monitoring authorities, since all documentations proving the legitimacy of the funds has been processed. Please don't see me as one of the numerous dubious Benin republic you have dealt with in the past. I am a different person entirely and I come from a different continent. I have the American spirit in me and I hate cheaters. I promise to always uphold the national unity of the United State. Please reply back ASAP and let me know your possibility of sending the
$50 US Dollars.

You can send it via Money Gram with below information, please copy the name correctly outline below to avoid mistake.

Account Officer Info: Money Gram Money transfer only.

Receiver's Name:......ZUVOL TISJE
Country:....... Benin Republic
City:....... Cotonou

As soon as you send the fee make sure you send the payment information. My Flight is Monday and i expect you to comply before time then so that the delivery will be completed. If you do not comply, then it will not be my fault if you do not receive your Package.

I hope you will understand and follow my instruction to enable me serve you better.

Feel free to call me for more details:

My mom got pregnant when she was 17. She and my father got married and I was born shortly after my mom's 18th birthday. Being a teenage husband and father was too much for my drug-addled dad to handle. He left shortly after my first birthday. He was in and out of jail a few times, became an alcoholic and froze to death under an interstate underpass trying to stay warm one particularly frigid winter night.

My mom had dropped out of high school to pursue her new life as a mother and a wife. Her husband gone, she found herself unable to find a job paying more than minimum wage. So, she got her GED and started taking community college night classes. My mom was extraordinarily despondent, distant. She was lonely.

She tried dating, but every man she met treated her like dirt. She got herself into abusive relationship after abusive relationship, the culmination of which was her moving in with the most abusive fucker of all. Gordon.

We lived in a small house at the edge of town. Gordon spent most of his time on the couch watching TV and getting high. My mom rarely left the house unless it was to go to the grocery store. She didn't want anyone to see her black eyes or the bruises all over her body.

Initially, I wasn't allowed to even speak with my mom. The only time I saw her was when Gordon was beating her. He wanted me to watch. He insisted that I learn how a real man treats a woman. The beatings became more and more regular.

I started to join in.

At first, I'd hold my mom's arms while Gordon put cigarettes out on her neck. Then I'd pull small sections of her hair until she screamed in pain. At first, it felt wrong for me to do these things but, with Gordon's encouragement, I learned that I was just helping my mom to learn how to be a better woman. As the months passed, we slowly stripped my mother of any dignity she had left. And along with her dignity went any tears she may have had left to cry.

She wasn't allowed to wear clothes. She wasn't even afforded the luxury of a toilet. If she had to shit, she had to ask us first. It was amazingly gratifying to watch my mom that first time she squatted over the linoleum in our kitchen and squeezed out a perfect log from her swollen asshole.

As I started adolescence, I became acutely interested in expressing my teenage angst through the infliction of sexual humiliation and pain on my mother. I was especially obsessed with her asshole. Countless times, I'd come home from school, frustrated by some little cunt cock tease. I'd bend my mom over, pull out the fingernail clippers, and clip bits of skin from her anus. She bled profusely. I'd use her ass blood as lubricant and jack off while she screamed in distress.

I must have gotten carried away one day. She'd never shit right again. I couldn't find the fingernail clippers, so I used a pair of scissors. I cut her anus. It looked like she had two assholes now. Two for me none for you. Twix.

I find my mom sexy. Some of you may be surprised but only if you knew you would realize how much i wanna fuck my mom in her sexy pussy and asshole. Her butt is bigger than my head, her boobs are fat big and jiggly, yet, she remains slim as always. Her hot smoothing voice makes me turned on everytime I hear it. She's like, the fucking best looking mom out their. There is no one I want than my mom. I broke up with my girlfriend to try and fuck my mom but I am afraid my mom doesn't want to fuck me back. I jerk wee wee everynight thinking about my mom. I tried to get rid of my sexual lust but every time I try I want more. I've seen her naked and I still cum to that every time. My only wish and dream is to feel her amazing pussy and asshole.

Mints. Specifically the winter green lifesaver mints. First you have one, thinking hey this is pretty neat. Before you know it, you’re ordering $10 bags of mints from Amazon once a week, you’re popping mints one after another, and you still have enough to hand out to everyone you see at school. You build up a reputation as the Mint Guy and you’ve gained respect from students and teachers because of your mint dealings. Soon enough, your addiction shows its bad side by making your tongue yellow. You try googling why your tongue is yellow, hoping it has nothing to do with the mints. You can’t find anything relating mints and yellow tongue on the internet, but you know deep down that it’s because of your mint addiction. You have to stop eating mints and scrub your tongue with mouthwash for 10 mins everyday. After 5 months, you’re offered a mint. You’ve been clean all this time but you figure one wouldn’t hurt. That one mint lead to another and before you know it your tongue is yellow again, but the mints help you focus. You NEED them. You’re in college now and consider yourself forced to start popping mints again so you could focus on your work, even though you know it’s unhealthy. Only time will tell where this goes, and you pray you find a healthier alternative. Rehab isn’t an option because society doesn’t realize the danger posed by this “candy”. You just have to come to terms with the fact that you’ll have to scrub your tongue religiously from now on. Don’t do mints, kids. They’ll ruin your life in the long run.

Technically any woman is born from a mother and a father. The father adds 50%, and the mother by recursion adds 25% from her father, with her mother also adding 12.5%, and her mother adding 6.25%, and her mother adding 3.125%, and her mother adding 1.5625, and her mother adding .78125. At this point, the gayness from previous mothers begins to become closer and closer to zero, and reaches negligible levels. 

However, bringing this limit to its logical conclusion at the dawn of man confirms that having sex with any women in the modern day is approximately 99.99999999999% gay.

You know what I like? Sexually? What I like sexually? You know what? My fetish? Yeah, it's casual sex.

Nothing kinky, no special moves nor any toys, just two people going at it under the covers or in the dark, yeah that's the good stuff. Just good ol' sex, that's what I like.

Dick in ass or vagina, no toys or chains or any bodily fluids expect for jizz nothing special, just sex between two people. These two people can be guys, but it's rare. Still though: Bonus points if it is gay porn because I totally support gay rights (No homo)

Calling all staff
Arrows shot
Arrows shot in front of the mineshaft
There’s about to be some TNT blowing up
Send all the available admins
Send in the moderators
Send in the MVPs
Send in the owners
Send in the... frick

I wanna find ores
Cuz I mined and I wanna dig all this
But it’s cool, after digging it, I’ll mine all the lapis
Oh no, you getting mad?
Gonna knock that diamonds right into the lava
That is extremely absurd
And now you wanna be the cynosure
You told me you finding the ores, ayy
Is that a diamond or lapis, ayy
Say that to your MVP’s face, hey
How you cheated on SkyWars
Hey you look afraid, must have seen a charged creeper
Maybe you’re on the way or fight if you have armor

Woo, you’ve just been griefing
Ever since your lil’ TNT blew up
Let’s staff know you did it all, now you’re capable to blow up all of my house
That’s bad, but I saw you try to grief my house
I was more disappointed that when I found out I hit 200k
Man, gotta mine
Gotta mine, mine, mine.
Cuz when you don’t have a mansion, replace it with a diamond
You really don’t see your friends hop in a mine
Hoping to join, they’re so tired getting griefed over and over and over and over and over again

Oh my gosh, you are a hacker
You make me so mad with your endless griefing
Your on the blacklist, now you dummy
Now go the nether and heck off
You’re messing up the server, so try your best to remember
You’re not a player, all you are is a griefer
Let’s find the block of day, but which one is it?
And it’s floating massive fire is a TNT block
You’re like SethBling but without the talent
You’re like Lionmaker but a bigger pedo
You’re like MinecraftKing, but no wait, you’re exactly like MinecraftKing

Yo wanna grief the server, but dude, you’re gonna be banned soon
How can you grief all the stuff but you’re too scared to do it on Mineplex

Little noob, little jerk, forgot to finish writing this lyric
Admit that you’re just hacking
[Inaudible Lyric]
Get it? You’re a hacker. This is what you wanted, right?
Hey I’m gonna grief this server with my cheats from 2005
Holy sheep, you’re as predictable as noob’s house
To call you just a grief would be an insult to the hackers

Whatever you said, the grief you did
You’ve done too much, you’re sick, just quit, that’s it
You’re a, you’re a pickle
Here’s what I predict
You’re a killing spree that will attended- unattended
How, how can a griefer just not know that they griefs too much
But lemme guess, you cry and try to get unbanned, but that won’t work
When you’re done, at least before so much
You’re, uh, just like the average griefer dude
You’re a bad griefer
You’ve done too much, and you’re sick and that’s that
So now that I think, you, you’re just a coal on the mineshaft

Got diamonds, emeralds, and the gold that I dig
And you’re still gonna be a little noob
Now I’m finished as planned
It was just 3 minutes and it was pretty bad
So I gotta a question to ask you dude
Wanna get banned too?

Engineer here.

I teach a few undergrad courses at a university, and don't get me wrong- I love my job! But I have an IQ of 158 and sometimes feel that my "resources" could be better allocated. Freshman ask me questions all day like "how do you draw the net vector of multiple superposed 3D vectors with a scientific calculator" and I don't mind pouring us a cuppa and kindly answering "you can't you fucking tard" but I'm and older man and it wears at me a little more than it used to.

Sometimes you just want to be wrong for once.

It’s a total crime against humanity while the world is at conflict and undergoing such turmoil. We are going there to build a weapon aimed at a country on Earth. Due to Atrophy we can NEVER live on the moon more than a short few months. It does have minerals that could be mined robotically but a weapon will be the priority, it’s the first thing a country builds when it steals new territory to keep others away. It’s the crime of the highest magnitude and will be lorded by the media as a great success and the sheeple as always will eat cake and watch in wonder from their filthy little hovels oblivious as to just what really goes on in the world.

Face it /bant/, you're the worst board on 4chan. 

This board has no reason to exist. We have /b/ for random shit; we have /int/ for international shit. We don't need an International/Random board. It's stupid. It's pointless. It's a waste of a board. The fact of the matter is that the ONLY time I come to /bant/ is because some shitty mod on /pol/ moved a thread here. /bant/ is /pol/'s shitting ground. The closest thing to /bant/ is a fucking landfill. 

All the boards, from /fit/ to /po/ have their own cultures, memes, and activities. /bant/ has nothing. It was supposed to be a place to shove all the random shit like risk threads and HWNDU from /pol/, but because /bant/ is such a small board all those thread die out on here. /bant/ has never produced any memes. It's slower than /lit/. It's not funny. I have never laughed when I was on /bant/. The closest thing to a culture that /bant/ ever had was Blepe, a worthless, shitty, stale-at-launch meme that was based entirely on ripping off Pepe. Nice work, guys. You really made a difference.

I had a dream of my aunt. She was wearing a yellow raincoat and nothing else. It ended just above her knees and you could see her slender legs. As I looked at her she saw me staring and gave me a sly smile. Then she unbuttoned the coat and pulled it open. I saw her naked, shiny breasts. They were made of cheese. So I approached her and smelled them. They definitely smelled like cheese too. God, it was such a turn on. I started licking them. The distinct, mouthwatering taste of cheese filled my mouth. I was ecstatic. And so was she. She moaned silently and pushed my head deeper into her soft, cheesy breasts while running her hand through my hair. Oh my god, it was heavenly. My peepee started feeling weird. I woke up and felt something wet in my pants. It was melted cheese.

Omg, so I was at the convenience store minding my own business when some random dude showed up and talked about Kylo Ren with the cashier, I overheard the conversation and I was like, omg, they like Reylo too and I tried to sneak my way in, both of them saw me and asked me if I liked Reylo.

I felt like I had no choice but to give in and asked them if there was a problem, they replied, “We were talking about Star Wars ships, omg, are you a big Reylo shipper too?” Suddenly, as they dropped their guards, my muscles started to bulge, tearing apart my shirt, I unleashed a flurry of over one hundred punches which targetted both of the fans’ Pressure Points.

I shouted “HOKUTO HYAKURETSU KEN!” (Hundred crack fists of the North Star) to give the audience an idea of what technique I had used.

The Reylo shippers chuckled and told me that it didn’t hurt, but little did they know that it was the legendary martial arts style of Hokuto Shinken that has been passed down for over 2000 years and that I was its rightful successor. I turned my back on them and contently replied, “Omae wa mou Shinderu.”

In total ju wa-shock and disbelief, they replied “NANI?” as their heads started to swell up and explode. People were impressed by my martial arts style and shook my hand as I went back home to enjoy my mac and cheese.

I actually saw Own Goal at a Mercadona store in Girona yesterday. I told him how cool it was to meet him in person, but I didn’t want to be a douche and bother him and ask him for photos or anything. He said, “Oh, like you’re doing now?”

I was taken aback, and all I could say was “Huh?” but he kept cutting me off and going “huh? huh? huh?” and closing his hand shut in front of my face. I walked away and continued with my shopping, and I heard him chuckle as I walked off. When I came to pay for my stuff up front I saw him trying to walk out the doors with like fifteen Milky Ways in his hands without paying.

The girl at the counter was very nice about it and professional, and was like “Señor, you need to pay for those first.” At first he kept pretending to be tired and not hear her, but eventually turned back around and brought them to the counter.

When she took one of the bars and started scanning it multiple times, he stopped her and told her to scan them each individually “to prevent any electrical infetterence,” and then turned around and winked at me. I don’t even think that’s a word. After she scanned each bar and put them in a bag and started to say the price, he kept interrupting her by yawning really loudly.

Hello there. You might not have seen my comments on here before but you're going to get used to me in the near future. Why? Because I'm going to make this subreddit a living hell for you to be in. You're not kind to anyone who is not White, Christian, Conservative, Straight, and Pro-Trump. So I'm not going to be kind to you. But where to start? I have so many things I would like to get off my chest. You know what, let me tell you a little bit about myself. I am mixed-race (75% White, 25% Asian), I am an agnostic atheist, I am a liberal, I am queer (in my case, leaning towards gay), and I am Anti-Trump. Now I'll find out the things we have in common with each other. I tolerate the existence of school vouchers, I am against safe spaces and trigger warnings (A study conducted by psychologists shows that they don't work), I am a supporter of a balanced federal budget, and, although it's not perfect, I believe capitalist economics is slightly superior to that of socialist economics. I use the word "liberal" somewhat loosely here as the international definition of it states that they favor less restrictions on both social and economic affairs. You may claim to believe the same thing if I had not told you the definition of a liberal. Don't you find it strange that despite the fact you claim that members of the political establishment are the "real authoritarians", their beliefs are anarchist compared to yours? Think about it. They want women to make their own reproductive choices. You want the government to take that away from them. They want minorities to be free to use whatever facilities they want and to to follow their passions. You want the government to take that away from them. They want LGBTQIA individuals to be free to love each other. You want the government to enforce laws that will jail them. They want the population to practice whatever beliefs they wish. You want the government to enforce your values and your values alone. Now compare your beliefs to that of the political establishment's and answer this question: Who are the real authoritarians? If you still believe that the political establishment is as authoritarian as you say it is, please explain why. I guess I'll be going now. I'll be to play some more games with you soon. Later.

Holy schmolies! This is a super hot pic. What an inviting looking vagina. It seems to be whispering "come hither" messages to my ears. Magical. 

The glimmer of juices all over your little love hole, ooph. Lips, fat and pink, engorged with the blood of lust. That little cave below, a dark unknown, eagerly awaiting exploration. Soft looking gorgeous breasts begging to be licked, sucked, and gently nibbled. A body that seems completely hairless, smooth and soft. Topped off with full kissable lips revealing a perfect smile and lovely curly locks. Any man would be privileged spend a night with you.  

This pic makes me really want to see your clit. If you had one more with the hood pulled up, the clit exposed and a glimpse at your vag hole, I think that might have been a top contender for #1 in my all time spank bank. That clit looks like it is seriously wanting to say hello under there. 

Also I'd like to see a pic of you doing an x- like pose. What I'm envisioning is you are in front of the mirror for the pic and facing away from it. Your phone is in your right hand. You keep your feet in place away from the mirror, turn to your left and twist as you need to get a nice side shot in the mirror. So that what we see is your full body, ass kind of from the back, good view of boob from the side, your left arm I'm not sure about, maybe under the boobs.  You'd be standing on your tippy toes. Your hair tucked to the right side, perhaps a frill or two hanging down, definitely want to be able to see your neck.

To all our readers in the U.S.,
We will get straight to the point: Today we ask you to help Wikipedia. To maintain our independence, we will never run ads. We depend on donations averaging about $15. Only a tiny portion of our readers give. If everyone reading this gave $3, we could keep Wikipedia thriving for years to come. The price of a coffee is all we need. When I made Wikipedia a non-profit, people warned me I’d regret it. Over a decade later, it’s the only top ten site run by a non-profit and a community of volunteers. Has it crossed my mind how much we could have made if it had ads? Sure. But it wouldn’t be the same. We wouldn’t be able to trust it. Most people ignore my messages. But I hope you’ll think about how useful it is to have unlimited access to reliable, neutral information. Please help keep Wikipedia online and growing. Thank you. — Jimmy Wales, Wikipedia Founder

You are playing 2fort, in a somewhat empty server. Stuck at a 4v5, a peculiar fellow joins the server named "Pixie the Fempyro Dragon", and you decide to play Soldier. You run into the BLU base, and steal their intel. "I'm doing it! I'm gonna cap the intel!" you think, blasting your way to victory, when all of the sudden an enemy pyro turns the corner. His degreaser is aimed at you, and he's got an unusual pink Brigade Helm with orbiting hearts. You fire a rocket, and you see the crimson lightning fly out of your launcher. It's a random crit! The pyro is done for! But all of the sudden, the pyro DEFLECTS the rocket, dealing a lethal blow to you. And in the killcam you see them do the Gas Blast taunt introduced in the Pyro Update, and a message appears in chat.
Pixie the Fempyro Dragon: Oowpsie!!!! :3 I made a big stinky OwO
You do not understand. You try to respond but your hands are paralyzed. A singular droplet of cold sweat streams down your nose. Your confusion turns into terror as you glance at their profile picture, which is a BBW-futa anthro fox. Your face turns red. White spittle is coming out of the corners of your mouth. You try to spam your lenny face bind but you simply cannot. The terror fades away, and what remains is a sense of existential dread. Nothingness. You give up on even trying to move out of spawn. Hours pass, days pass, and weeks pass. Engineers passing by on their way to the Intelligence would tell stories of you. "Say, Dell, you see that stone-faced fella at resupply?" "Why I have, Buck. What's up with him?" "Why I reckon he one of them AFK types."
The Engineers try to unravel the mystery, but never come close. The secret remains buried inside of you, burning at your very core. As the Engineers, Snipers, and Demomen of Teufort leave, you are all that remains of the server. Your legacy is merely a whisper in the wind.

I'm seeing many comments on here that diseases are kept infectious because they're 'profitable.' Please take off the tin foil hat. 

I am a medical research scientist and I can tell you, the massively talented team I'm in work extremely hard to combat illness and improve survival rate. 

Sure, unfortunately some treatments for illnesses are not manufactured. This is due to a cost-benefit analysis of the medication. A costly to produce treatment for an uncommon illness, or treatment that may not be hugely successful or it doesn't improve survival rates much, will not be marketed. Even if there is some evidence it works. Unfortunately that's the way of it. Whenever we get the red light on a product line, we all think 'but if my mum had this illness...and companies have shelved a cure...' But we need to move on and focus on a treatment for an illness that's extremely common: HIV/cancer for example. Not only would this net massive profits for the company that have put in sometimes hundreds of millions into R&D, but it will save, or improve, countless lives. 

If we produced medication at a loss, we'd go out of business. And then there'd be no more cures for anything. The cost of medical isn't the cost of producing it, that pales in comparison to the cost of developing and approving it. Recently we did an animal trial on 3 pigs. The cost? 1.8million GBP. To show something we already knew. Add that on top of a 3 year project which has already cost in excess of 30million and you'll see where the cost comes from. 

And if this product doesn't make it to market, the losses also have to be recouped from somewhere. I.e. Another product line.

Sleep is for the weak. I derive immense power from sleep-deprivation. Rest well, sheep, for atop a pillow you are suppressed.

>People who don't sleep enough become zombies who have to eat our brains to live and function. Lol.

Yes, continue to gorge yourself with the lies of the dominant hegemony! Those who manipulate your life, those in power, they do not sleep, for they are occupied herding you and the rest of the sheeple with telepathic- psychosomatic- psychokinetic radio waves. You just gotta transcend it, break the transmission-- once you've absolved yourself of the illusory necessity of sleep, you crack the whole thing WIDE OPEN. Doors of perception unleashed, baby, true, unmitigated human experience. Heed my message before the delete my post and trace my coordinates-- but they won't catch me, oh no they won't, because I'm always five exponential steps ahead of them.

My favorite anime is American Politics.
Rob Ford is best girl.
I cried when JFK died.
George Washington was a huge inspiration.
Barack Obama was very progressive.
And Donald Trump is one of the best cases of an anime villain becoming a protagonist in all of anime history.
The Britain spinoff was pretty good too.
Brexit was a great filler arc.
The short but amazing 9/11 arc was pretty good and left a huge mark on the series.

They remind me of my grandparents.

My mom got pregnant when she was 17. She and my father got married and I was born shortly after my mom's 18th birthday. Being a teenage husband and father was too much for my drug-addled dad to handle. He left shortly after my first birthday. He was in and out of jail a few times, became an alcoholic and froze to death under an interstate underpass trying to stay warm one particularly frigid winter night.

My mom had dropped out of high school to pursue her new life as a mother and a wife. Her husband gone, she found herself unable to find a job paying more than minimum wage. So, she got her GED and started taking community college night classes.
My mom was extraordinarily despondent, distant. She was lonely.

She tried dating, but every man she met treated her like dirt. She got herself into abusive relationship after abusive relationship, the culmination of which was her moving in with the most abusive fucker of all. Gordon.

We lived in a small house at the edge of town. Gordon spent most of his time on the couch watching TV and getting high. My mom rarely left the house unless it was to go to the grocery store. She didn't want anyone to see her black eyes or the bruises all over her body.

Initially, I wasn't allowed to even speak with my mom. The only time I saw her was when Gordon was beating her. He wanted me to watch. He insisted that I learn how a real man treats a woman. The beatings became more and more regular.

I started to join in.

At first, I'd hold my mom's arms while Gordon put cigarettes out on her neck. Then I'd pull small sections of her hair until she screamed in pain. At first, it felt wrong for me to do these things but, with Gordon's encouragement, I learned that I was just helping my mom to learn how to be a better woman.
As the months passed, we slowly stripped my mother of any dignity she had left. And along with her dignity went any tears she may have had left to cry.

She wasn't allowed to wear clothes. She wasn't even afforded the luxury of a toilet. If she had to shit, she had to ask us first. It was amazingly gratifying to watch my mom that first time she squatted over the linoleum in our kitchen and squeezed out a perfect log from her swollen asshole.

As I started adolescence, I became acutely interested in expressing my teenage angst through the infliction of sexual humiliation and pain on my mother. I was especially obsessed with her asshole.
Countless times, I'd come home from school, frustrated by some little cunt cock tease. I'd bend my mom over, pull out the fingernail clippers, and clip bits of skin from her anus. She bled profusely. I'd use her ass blood as lubricant and jack off while she screamed in distress.

I must have gotten carried away one day. She'd never shit right again. I couldn't find the fingernail clippers, so I used a pair of scissors. I cut her anus. It looked like she had two assholes now. Two for me none for you. Twix.

Calling all admins. griefers detected
Houses found in front of a big ravine
Theres about to be 1.11.2 in progress
Send all available admins
Send in the back up
Send in the big swords
Send in the endermen
Send in the... frick

I went in the cave and i found a lot of diamonds
But its cool after griefing you ill send you 3 gold blocks
Oh no you getting mad
Gonna swing the sword right at your helmet
That crap was freaking absurd
Youre a miner that can't mine gold with picks
Type like you are a troll
Ayy
Is that your diamonds or your gold
Ayy
Say to the admins face
Ayy
How youre gonna grief my house
Ayy you look afraid must of a seen a creeper
Well same little fart but im not scared to kill it

Woo! youve been mining
Ever since you got a pick youve been mining
Let admins think you didn't grief it all
When you werent capable of crafting a wooden sword
Thats bad but then i saw you try to build
I was more disappointed than when i found out
Notch dissowned minecraft
Boy gotta mine
Gotta mine mine mine
Because when you dont have an admin role
Replace it with diamond armor
You really dont see your friends swinging their swords
Hoping to die in the lava
Of you throwing the price of what to trade in their face
No no no no you think theyre 

Oh my notch youre such a legend
You make my pick hard with your reckless mining
You got an admin role and youre oh so funny
Please take me to your house and craft with me
Youre freakinf delusional
So try your best to remember
You are not an admin
You a piece of crap griefer
Griefer boy a flavor of the month
But which is it huh
A whiny griefer wannabe admin
Its salt n griefadmin
Youre like notch but with no talent
Like stampy but not a faggot
Like lionmaker
Actually yeah youre exactly like lionmaker

Say you dont wanna look like a jerk
But dude youre gonna be slain to death
How can you claim that crap
When youre to scared to go in the cave alone
Little fart little crap
Suck my big fat diamond pick
Admit that you just got slain
Id say "take the sword" if you could pvp it
Get it because i love minecraft
Thats what you wanted right
Hey lets make fun of the enderman with enderman eyes
Notch christ youre as predictable as a house tour
To call you surface level would be an insult to the pressure plate

Whatever youve promised to follow youve quit
You can't mine for shit you griefing stinkin prick
Youre diamond count is fickle heres what i predict
Your house is bound to blow up to rubble
You the heck can someone called notch
Not realize theyre the owner
But let me guess im a bad miner right
Isnt that your excuse
When youre too stupid to explain your views
Cause youre as basic as a one block wooden block
Youre an insecure unoriginal little fart and thats that
So come to think of it
Youre the dog filter mod in minecraft

Got diamonds diamonds gold and the iron and the stone
And yet youre always gonna be a little jerk
Now im finished as planned
It was just 3 minutes so it wasn't that bad
But i got one question for you
Did the potion taste good tho?

Vika is, in my honest opinion, the sexiest Fire Emblem character of all.
Long hair, pretty face (thank you, Senri Kita), nice body proportions, tight clothing that still looks practical and appropriate for going out (unlike half the cast of Fates), good amount of leg (Lyn is my girl, but she shows way too much. There's also that thing regarding her panties...or lack thereof.) and the wings give her that aura of mystery and mystique.
The fact that there's barely any artwork of her online is a crime. I would say Zephiel was right, if it weren't for you making this beautiful piece of artwork.
Mad, MAD respect to you, lady.

It's honestly delicious watching you simpleton Jerrys squirm like the measley little wimps you are. Oh please! Continue to follow what the media tells you-- how it's COOL to pretend US RICKS are the idiots for "thinking a silly little show reveals higher intelligence". Your idiocy is like fuel to us. The more and more you attempt to mock the superior, the wider the gap becomes; I am PICKLE RICK and SO WHAT if ONE OR TWO 'fake ricks' made idiots of themselves in public. They were sheep of the citadel. We are the RICKS and you will never be more than a silly Jerry. Or at best, a Morty-- a tool for our research and studies to continue.

I understand that pickle rick was hyped out of hell before season 3 even fucking aired, its funny i get it very bizzare. But not only is it a stale ass meme, why does everyone love it so much? i really don't get whats so funny i see people losing their minds over Ricks existence as a pickle, but nobody even references the actual jokes he makes while explaining or doing his pickle feats or the big arcing jokes to go along with. Everyone is always pickle rick this, pickle rick that, pickle rick is oh so fuckin funny. You people realize the whole joke behind him turning into pickle right? The SMARTEST MAN IN THE ENTIRE UNIVERSE turned himself into a fucking pickle, so he didn't have to attend a session of family therapy. Had it set up and planned out way ahead of time not considering Morty would see through his scheme and call his bullshit. Rick Sanchez was so petty he turned himself into an inanimate pickle that couldnt move, or do anything on its own, lied about it to Morty, Summer, and Beths faces, so he wouldn't have to go to therapy and "talk about how he felt" and/or so he didn't have to outwardly tell Beth and the kids upfront "I'm not going to therapy, its dumb and i don't respect it". Then has to go through literal hell as a pickle just to end up going to therapy anyway, after he arrives he reluctantly explains why he didn't want to come. And Dr.Wong drops a nuke on his ass.
"You chose to come here, to belittle my vocation, just as you chose to turn yourself into a pickle. You are the MASTER of YOUR universe, Your enormous mind LITERALLY vegetating from your hand. And yet here you are covered in rat blood and feces."
Rick gets his shit thrown in his face so hard not only does HE not have a legitimate response to come back with, he ends up leaving and sincerely apologizing for the first time ever. The fan base blatantly ignores this huge plot point, bc "ohho Pickle riiick thats so funny and bizzare man" which only proves the Family Therapy storyline, people choose what they see and what you take in and choose what they apply with that knowledge. If youve spent forever obsessing over the fact Rick turned himself into a pickle, your no better than him by choosing not to see the enormous social issues the family therapy storyline tackles out about humanity as a whole. Rick and Morty is designed to be a cultural wake up call, a literal testament to looking at the big fucking picture. and now its fanbase is full of ignorant sheep, that dig so hard for evidence in the episodes when all the points are clearly laid out and obvious, people that lose their minds over a fucking sauce no one cared about until Rick said something about it. Which they probably only did in the first place for shits and giggles to see. Come on people like you are reflecting the one thing the show outwardly shits on the most, mindless people, being mindless idiots. I love this show it is unbelievably clever, and way ahead of its time, but its airing in the age of bliss ignorance. This masterpiece is getting its name slandered by the fans that say they love it so much. Okay Rant post over

Have you ever heard of the Dunboyne Lidl Stampede of "15.

>All hell broke loose when they opened the second till, unrest began to grow amongst the queuing crowd before murmuring that a second till was about to open began to circulate. In the end, all it took was a member of the Lidl staff to sit at the next till over and say “I’ll take you here now” to cause shoppers a rush to the new line, resulting in devastation as men, women and children became caught up in the crush.

>They were acting like animals, Some were getting caught under the wheels of  trolleys and fell to the ground, The crushed and squashed loaves of bread was a horrific sight,  

it forced Lidl to open more than one checkout during rush hour meaning that from that day on, there would be less staff able to push around pallets of bottled water around the shop all day.

Engineer here, and I totally know that feeling.

I teach a few undergrad courses at a university, and don't get me wrong- I love my job! But I have an IQ of 158 and sometimes feel that my "resources" could be better allocated. Freshman ask me questions all day like "how do you draw the net vector of multiple superposed 3D vectors with a scientific calculator" and I don't mind pouring us a cuppa and kindly answering "you can't you fucking tard" but I'm and older man and it wears at me a little more than it used to.

I have been burned on too many occasions. And I get it, I could have been more careful and put on some extra SPFs to aid my survival, but that doesn't change the outcome. I also burn easily, no surprise there. But among all of the sun's crimes, one stands out. The heat. I don't like the heat. Just today, I was on my way to art class (5th period for your information) after a exiting period of history. I decided to "pop' in to give a friendly greeting to 4th period English class, but little did I know that it was unbearably hot inside (this was obviously the work of the sun)! I had to leave before any further mental or physical damage befell me. Overall, the sun is good for us, but I believe it's intentions are much more sinister than anything we could conceive. Thank you for your time, and be cautious out there people.

Tom Petra was born recently god rest his soul. It's times like this when I play monopoly. A board jame that is comforting to my shit hole. I used to queef as the sun Rainith down upon my shoulders. DAMN!. I used to say because my skin just friggen blinded me. In Austria my grandma always cremed her own donuts every Wednesday. She said I was 1/3 of a human and me and her had constant gurialla warfare with each other in 1492. She once told everyone and me that she meat Ronald Jesus Regan who was in her nitric squad called the "Rough Raiders". Which was a kinky meat dormitorium where they constantly chilled in England, New hamshire. Their friendship was ended ever 10 years when he told her" I am going reverse doorstop on your ass". She was the co founder of all the tomatoe gmo products and jingoism. In 1555withvso much spunk and spink my grandpa delivered his wife's baby but ended up inprednating her right there. That's when I was born from my grandparents. I think about them never quite often. Oh boy was what my grandma always said quite funny it's not.

Literally all day I've been looking up about incubuses and humans being raped/molested by ghosts and spirits and that's why happened to me last night. My moms spirit and I had intercourse. And the crazy part is, it was the best I've ever had. She took me to a whole different level of turned on. Like I was actually being touched and aroused by a disembodied soul. And I even came. So did she. But it's weird because ghost rape takes place INSIDE your body. The spirit actually invades your body as a surrogate and fucks your insides. It's the most intense, most erotic, most passionate, most pleasing, most amazing night of my life. My moms ghost initiated sex with her oldest son. If that doesn't prove she loved me and wanted nothing more than happiness and pleasure in my life, idk what
does.

Horror is worst genre of film today. Every single horror film is the exact same thing, trying to scare the audience with cheap jumpscares. The only type of people who are into them are teen girls, and not just the normal type of teen girl. I'm talking about the kind of teen girl who just got off watching Foamy the Squirrel on newgrounds.com while signing a "Bring Back Invader Zim" petition wearing a Jack Skellington hoodie and Happy Tree Friends tube socks purchased at Hot Topic during an Emily the Strange buy one get one 50% off sale where she discovered Serenity Rose from Slave Labor Graphics Comics while her overbearing but loving father restricts her from going to the My Chemical Romance/Limp Bizkit concert with a 5-years-older-than-her boyfriend that constantly IMs outsourced stolen Pr0n and IZ comic art over a 56k modem on America Online trial discs on myspace.com with a Top 8 consisting of Tim Burton, Jack Sparrow, Eminem, Jesus Christ, and whatever angsty band is the hit new thing on Disney Adventures magazine and spends all day filling out "What Kingdom Hearts Character are You?" quizzes only to complain she didn't get Riku and is unable to watch the 2003 MTV Music Awards because her deadbeat older brother is always hogging the living room TV playing Tony Hawk's Underground on his Halo Edition transparent green X-Box using third-party Mad Catz airflow controller with a busted analog stick constantly leaning to the right making anti-Semitic remarks about how Eric stole his wicked McTwist over the helicopter in Hawaii footage﻿

Before microtransactions. Before every single one of their franchises sported hats, trading cards and lottery loot boxes as the company's soulless, money-hungry bread and butter. Before they stopped caring that their brand is tainted by affiliation with Skin Gambling Sites directed at children. There was a time when they could do no wrong. When they were hailed as the saviours of video games, the ones who would give us sanctuary from Crimes Against Gaming led by the greedy, filthy street-gang of aborted satan-spawn fetuses of Activision, EA and Warner Bros - so much so, that Gabe became one of the best known memes to ever grace the net. Every gamer loved the brilliant guy who started his own company, doubled down on the quality of the game he wanted to release, dreaming of building something more than a sustainable bank account. And £uck having some board consisting of old people in gray suits with Playmo-hairdo's - he didn't need a board, he didn't want one. He was the promised one and his ambition grew with his knife collection, putting The Fear into the black hearts of The Awful Ghost of XBOX Live, The Abhorrent Demons of Horribly Implemented DRM, and The Cult of Selling Video Game Art and Experiences Like Cheap Washing Powder. The same deprived-of-emotions CEOs and Corporate Henchmen reading spreadsheets to their kids at bedtime, Gabe would fight with all his righteous fury. I used to love Valve. Before that same brilliant guy became a victim of his own Laissez-faire company where the apathy of being too afraid to release proper games seems to be the only needed credential for any new hire. Before Valve developed a reaction time akin to a fossilized Brontosaurus, where fixing a line of code started taking 6 months of meetings to decide on what editor to use and to check if there was any microtransactions or VR they could implement in the future. You know what? Sometimes changing full diapers IMMEDIATELY is the best cause of action before the stink starts ruining every pleasentness around you; not thinking about why, when or the optimal way of changing it for a long time before you do, looking like 40 road workers looking bewilderly at each other while tossing one spade between them. Stop being so "brilliant" and start doing the maybe boring, but hugely necessary menial tasks REQUIRED of you. You come off as spoiled prodigy kids to your customers. Empty your to-do list diapers, and start with the no-curated-games diaper first because it has the greatest stink of all. Astronauts have to p|ss and sh|t and clean up after themselves BESIDES the brilliant, awesome research stuff that make them legends. So please, for the love of liar-lofty Molyneux promises, you hipster-developer-douchedivas-too-great-for-this-world; start doing the same. I used to love Valve. Before they decided to never curate another game again, letting all the asset flippers run rampant and sh|tting up the store front. Before they started hiding behind numbers of too many customers to curate content for when they have an income next to a middle-sized country. Before they changed their Steam EULA to say you now rent the games you buy instead of owning them. We all know about the cliffhanger that is a decade old now. We also know of the other cliffhangers that aren't going to be solved anytime soon. We know that all the writers left the company. Guess why. How fulfilled would you be as a writer if you were told there will not be another story in a game we make ever again? Here, have a DOTA promotional package and a cookie. I used to love Valve. Before the politics of the company dictated that no one has to work on anything they don't want to. Before it became all too clear that no one wants to bring a fresh coat of paint to the store or anything else crumbling around them because they don't deem it "cool" enough to work on. Before Valve's employees were worth more than their customers. Before what the workers wanted was more important than what the customers needed. Imagine Christopher Nolan dropping anything resembling Inception, Interstellar, or The Dark Knight, deciding to make Smurf-movies instead. Catering to foul-mouthed kids and toxic teenagers screaming at each other in the movie theatre. He would betray his vision, ethics and work morale. He would betray himself. He would tarnish his reputation just as Valve has done by not cleaning up after themselves after all the sh|t they pulled these last years. I used to love Valve. Before cowardice and the easy way out became the norm at the company who was once at the forefront of everything great and revolutionary about the games industry. Before they started to "communicate through products" in lieu of words - the same "products" they are no longer making. Same goes for updating their storefront that sells games, but doesn't curate them, sort them or organize them in any decent or fashionable way, shape or form. I remember when Valve was MAKING trends instead of following them. When THEY set the standards in games instead of being content with a participation diploma. They broke piñatas like they owned the room. They looked by far the best of the whole line-up, they were the 10 out of 10, the perfect model without the make-up, the flexible aluminum standard to the iron curtain of evil giants hellbent on destroying game franchises instead of preserving the medium and the culture behind it. I used to love Valve. Before they dropped news of something everybody wished could be a relevant or even a sparkling new IP. Before revealing it's a friggin' card game for DOTA instead of the drippingly epic, story-driven, inventive adventure they used to create. Before money, money, and MORE MONEY became their sole purpose in life. Before they announced: "Hey, here's Artifact, the DOTA card game no one wants. Or as we'll call it in-house, Money Printer E". I watched in horror and disbelief as they turned into a worse version of the same soulless, imperialistic stinkadoors that Pachinko-Konami-firing-Kojima, UDon'tPlay-Ubisoft, and other Game Companies of Lucifer has become - and decided to one-up them, to actually dethrone them and take the evil seat for themselves. Proving to everyone that you either die a hero of the industry or you sell microtransaction-items long enough to become a worse gambling-supported-by-our-in-house-pyschologist's-addiction-analysis, money-grubbing cumharvester than Bobby £ucking Kotick. I used to love Valve. Before they broke my heart and destroyed the one hobby that took me away from the staleness of a world where Donald Trump is the US President, where baby-boomers have destroyed everything they could get their tiny hands on, where most millennials will never own their own house, where religious people blow up other people because they believe in the wrong imaginary god or are simply too adult to believe in such bs at all, where the 1% £uck over people in their own tribe daily, where CEOs are better if they are sociopaths because it's good for business. The ONE darn thing I could immerse myself in, that would let me escape from the suffocating toilet-clogged world's tyranny, Valve made their mission to destroy. Because like every other frog-jockey, goat-m4sturbator and med-student-turned-Mengele that will be the end of this planet and the human race - Valve decided MONEY is worth more than ethics, art, the joy of creating something unique, the reason why you became a designer, programmer, engineer, or why you're human at all. It's more important than the exploration of the universe or seeing your newborn baby in the eyes. Even when you have $2,000,000,000 ALREADY. I used to love Valve. Until they betrayed their fans, goals and ideals for nothing else than money, turning themselves into the greatest real life tale of The Great Fallen Hero usurped into The Foulest Game Villain of them all. i have been playing Dota 2 since it was in early Beta and have been playing for a long time. I have around 4800 Hours of my life wasted on this game. It was all fun and amazing when i started to play and discovering a whole new game with endless possibilities and ways to play it. But it all went downhill when Ranked Matchmaking came out. I started to play the 10 calibration games eagerly as i thought i was hot shit, after the games i got 3.1 k . To no surprise i was sad and after another few games i dropped to 3k and i immediately stopped playing ranked and went back to normal matchmaking. A year passes and i watched people like RTZ,Dendi and many others get to 6k and i was inspired to get back on the saddle to grind for MMR. To my surprise a year of training actually made me better,Months of grinding i finally got to 3.8 but i was stuck around there for almost half a year.For those 6 months i was fucking pissed,depressed and just a fucking piece of shit where i kept raging and just going full tilt game after game. I dont know what happened but i somehow got it together and made it to 4k recently(Wooho) . I made my way to 4.6k and i thought to myself , Hey this shits getting pretty easy i think i might get to 5k. Im pretty fucking sure right after i thought of that i lost game after game after game until i am now at 4k. I go through game after game of flames from teammates,cancerous heroes and people going mid/carry thinking they are hot shit but after they die once or twice start blaming everyone for every death/fight. This game has been everything to me. It helped me through shit times and made me happy when i got to play with my friends and fuck around. Sadly i am unable to play with my friends now as i have moved. Now all im left with is Ranked matchmaking where every game u feel like u want to shoot yourself while u drown yourself. So im here on reddit to ask for some guidance and help on how i can just calm the fuck down when my team starts flaming and the asshole i am start joining in and the whole team becomes a shitshow and not even a team anymore. TL;DR - This games cancer and im pretty much done with it,but as a latch ditch effort im here on reddit to see if anyone got any ideas on how to calm people down/myself down when things start going to shit P.S- Valve please release the next patch,if i see one more lina or storm or lesh i swear to god i will fucking become the next hitler DotA can't compete. The player count amounts up to a measly sub 1 million, while 1% of the worlds entire population plays league. Soon DotA will die, it will because Valve can't carry games, but League of Legends will live on. So basically, you're all future league players. I BET that the next prizepool will either be the same as last year's or will stagnate. If it does, it's over, already the prizepot growth slowed down dramatically. It's basically just a waiting game. See you fags when you're the next starcraft! Starting to masturbate as soon as the "Ready" thing pops up and it makes that "DAAAHH!!" sound. I just get this extreme arousal from it so I immediately go on pornhub to watch a porn video and masturbate whilst the game is loading. Sometimes it takes quite a bit longer so I had to AFK in the drafting phase or even the first 2 minutes but it's already I feel revitalised as soon as I finish and start playing. I've done this a couple of times already and I feel like I've conditioned my body to get aroused every time I hear the "DAAAH!!" sound and I get erection all the time. TLDR: Conditioned myself to get aroused when i hear the "DAAAH!!" sound at the start of dota games Sorry for my english, i am a native spanish speaker) Well, first of all i am a avg player who likes to play this game for fun, also i enjoy playing ranked games too. The thing is, that i have been reading how people complain about how broken is this patch, how they want the new patch and blablabla, but that's not the point which is wrong, the point is this: As an average player i can play at certain times because of my studies and when i play, the game puts me in the team with toxic people (mostly peruvians), i'm not that kind of guy who insults and blames his teammates all the game, i always try to be kind and calm down throughout the match. In my last game (Match id = 3507857814) a player (@ron, peruvian player, I deduced it because i know how they spanish attempt is) asked mid to play kunkka, then another asked mid too, to play windranger, and well i asked safe lane to play jugg (i wanted to improve my stats), when wr asked mid, kunkka started to flame and insult wr. At the beginning of the game i noticed that kunkka didn't buy anything, and i asked him in a nice way to play bottom with pudge and control enemy's farm, then he started to insult me and flame me, after that i asked to wr to go bottom with pudge, same thing, venge took my rune, i made a couple of pings to her. The match starts, and with this, kunkka started feeding, once and another. Pudge gets tilted, and he goes afk, i asked him if he can abandon, because i didn't want to play with that kunkka, and he replies me that he abandoned last game because of the same player(don't know if that's true), and then i decided to leave the match. This not a complaint, I just want you to know what's killing the game. Is not the patch, is not how broken are some items or heroes, it is the players that are killing the game, and valve does nothing to fix it. There are literally no words left in the dictionary to describe how slow and awful valve's updates are. But still, even though MYM was a huge disappointment, and there are so many under and over-powered weapons in the game, I would still have fun playing tf2. I love playing as all classes except for demo. But then it just stopped. Without exaggeration, a quarter of the time I walk out of spawn, there's some demo spawn camping us with crits, or there's a heavy + med spamming quick-fix ubers, or a server rapist who's invested too much time into a dying game, lmaobox hacker, or even fucking delfy himself. Assuming you make it past that, half the time your team is getting steamrolled. The other half of the time, i just get horribly bored stomping innocent players. The saddest part is that this is not even exaggeration. I get more random drops than I do remotely-well balanced games (which, to be fair, isn't saying much because crates are so common.) TF2 is so horribly inconsistent. One minute you're on a 20-godlike killstreak as a soldier, helping your team push through, and the next minute you die 5 times in a row IMMEDIATELY after respawning because you got killed by crits, stickies, stomped by the server rapist... whatever. I think completely random teams would be fairer than this. Just put on class limits of 2 each, put high-level high-hour server rapists on both sides, and then just roll the dice for everyone else. It's so frustrating that the TF2 team is trying their fucking hardest to save this sinking ship, this hidden gem of unique class-based shooters, but because for some fucking reason they can't get more staff, this game is just left to die. I bet overwatch would've never existed, or would not have been so popular, if TF2 was instead a fully fleshed-out game with excellent team balance, bug fixes, balanced weapons, and actually fucking helped out new players by telling them what all the hundreds of different weapons and game mechanics were. What's really fucking sad is that even CSGO, valve's most popular shooter (unfortunately more so than tf2) still has a somewhat slow development cycle and indescribably horrible updates created by people who don't play the game (R8 update anyone?). The only things valve cares about are dota 2 and Steam VR, because that's all the "new and flashy" stuff these days. I feel so bad for the tf2 team. Shitheads like me are probably flooding out all the meaningful posts who want to help the game. there are just a handful of people running around with their hair on fire, trying to save this sinking ship. Nobody else at valve wants to help them out. And I don't blame them for not helping, because it seems like every time anyone touches the game it just gets worse and then the community gets stirred up and... ugh /rant To be fair, you have to have a very high IQ to understand DotA 2. The strategy is extremely subtle, and without a solid grasp of game theory and stochastic outcomes most of the gameplay will go over a typical viewer's head. There's also Icefrog’s teleological outlook, which is deftly woven into the characterisation of his heroes - Icefrog’s personal philosophy draws heavily from Tolkien literature, for instance. The fans understand this stuff; they have the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate the depths of the game, to realize that it’s not just a pastime – it says something deep about LIFE. As a consequence people who dislike DotA 2 truly ARE idiots- of course they wouldn't appreciate, for instance, the epistemological consequences of denying creeps, which itself is a cryptic reference to Derrida's metaphysical essay How to Avoid Speaking: Denials. I'm smirking right now just imagining one of those addlepated simpletons scratching their heads in confusion as Icefrog's genius unfolds itself on their computer screens. What fools... how I pity them. 😂 And yes by the way, I DO have a DotA 2 tattoo. And no, you cannot see it. It's for the ladies' eyes only- And even they have to demonstrate that they're within 500 MMR points of my own (preferably lower) beforehand. Last night while playing Dota 2 for 16 days straight, god Gaben the Almighty visited me in my dreams after losing 6k MMR points. Gaben has shown me the future of Dota 2. Believe me this is as real as it gets boys. After TI7, RTZ will leave EG to join Secret again because they lost TI. Fear's girlfriend will play as the new carry for EG. Dendi will still be playing for NaVi because he still refuse to retire. XBOCT will finally reach a rating of 5 as a carry. SingSing will create a new professional team and play all five roles by himself. Admiralbulldog will stop his twitch streams and also shutdown his youtube account because the god almighty Gaben has revoked his "TI WINNER" status. God Gaben has also shown me a short vision of the final match of Abed and Miracle playing against each other, both having MMR of 9976. Just short of 1 game to be hailed the first 10K MMR in dota history. Miracle is in Dire and Abed is in Radiant. Abed instapicks meepo at the first 0.005 seconds of the picking phase and Miracle went for the hard carry Anti-Mage. Abed then tells his whole team to focus hunting down Miracle for the first 5 mins of the game. However Miracle didnt go for the typical battlefury AM and instead went for an early fighting AM with shadowblade as his first item, no boots. I was honestly shocked by this amazing 10K play. Literally never been done in the history of dota 2. Miracle then starts roaming the map and automatically cast manavoid on unsuspecting radiant heroes, resulting to an ultrakill for Miracle just 14 minutes into the game. Meanwhile abed with his meepo also has a trick on his sleeve for this decisive match. Abed didnt skill up his Meepo's "Divided we Stand" and opted for a single hard hitting Meepo with only Net and Geostrike. From the way I see it, Miracle didnt have any idea what Abed was doing boys. Abed went for an early radiance build with his single meepo, farming it just after 16minutes. The runes spawn and abed suddenly sees an invi rune in the river near the dire secret shop. Abed quickly gets the rune and walks toward the dire alone with his single radiance meepo. He sees miracle farming 16 ancient stacks and stands beside him while he farms for EXP and casual last hits from his radiance. Miracle didnt know why he was losing so much HP aside from the fact that almost 40 ancient creeps was attacking him. When he was down below 50hp, Abed tossed a net on Miracle, breaking the invisibility and preventing him from escaping. Abed secured the most crucial kill of the game. The death of Miracle's AM gave out an intense light like the sun was about to explode that it blinded me for the rest of my life. My eyes burning from the Intensity of the 10K MMR fight between a single radiance Abed Meepo and a shadowblade no boots Miracle AM. God Gaben whispered to my ears that in order to restore my vision again and be able to play dota, I must first reach a battlepass level of 4000 for TI8 and spread the good news to reddit that HalfLife3 will release after 20 more years. I have been blessed by God Gaben. My blindness allowed me to see the future. As of the moment I am still blind. I wrote this post using my still functional feet and third leg. While I am still unable to play Dota 2, I had already made loans to secure my level 4000 battlepass for TI8. slark is such a balanced fucking hero, oh yeah let's give a hero who can purge literally anything free heart and the ability to escape any teamfight or gank ever, let's make a hero who preys off of supports who can't defend themselves when they try to ward and put sentries for slark but it doesn't fucking matter because even if you try to counter slark some gay-ass bullshit purging fucking shit makes it impossible, fuckig slark gay ass hero I am so close to just abandoning games if enemy team picks him fuck slark fuck shit ass fuck fuck, also EVERY FUCKING GAME SOME FUCKING RUSSIAN INSTALOCKS PUDGE IF HE'S ON MY TEAM HE MISSES ALL HIS HOOKS, TAKES SAFELANE, TRIES TO FARM AND DIES IF HE'S ON THE ENEMY TEAM HE'S HOOKED QOP MID 4 TIMES, IS ON 5-0-6 AND HAS A BLINK AND TRANQUILS 6 MINUTES INTO THE GAME HE HAS A FUCKING FREE AGHANIMS SCEPTRE AND WILL HOOK YOU FROM YOUR FOUNTAIN EVERY 4 SECONDS. FUCK THAT HERO FUCK CYRILLIC NAMED PUDGES DELETE THIS FUCKING HERO OH AND DON'T BUY DIVINE YOU FUCKING RETARDS, THEIR WAS LITERALLY NO FUCKING REASON TO GET A DIVINE WHEN WE HAD A 20K NETWORTH ADVANTAGE AND ALREADY GOT MEGA CREEPS, NAGA WAS FUCKING POOR, EMBER WAS FUCKING POOR, AND YOU LITTLE SHIT HAD TO GET A RAPIER, RUN OFF BY YOURSELF, AND GET CONTROLLED TO DEATH BY THE SPIRIT BREAKER AND OGRE, WHICH EMBER PICKED UP OF COURSE, MAKING IT DIFFICULT TO ACTUALLY GET THE TIER 4S, THEN YOU ENDED UP AFK ABANDONING AND DOWN THE DRAIN OUR TEAMFIGHT GOES SINCE NAGA IMMEDIATELY SONGS WHEN WE GET CLOSE ENOUGH TO JUMP EMBER SPIRIT AND WE CAN'T DO SHIT ABOUT IT BECAUSE WE ONLY HAD ONE BKB WHICH WAS INSTANTLY BURSTED DOWN, WE ENDED UP GETTING WIPED AS HE PURCHASED A SECOND RAPIER ALONG WITH NAGA GETTING SIX SLOTTED IN THIRTY MINUTES AFTER THAT, EVENTUALLY, YOU CAME BACK AND SAID THAT YOU WERE SICK AND THROWING UP, WHY THE ACTUALLY FUCK WERE YOU PLAYING RANKED WHEN YOU WERE SICK, ITS LIKE YOUR DECISION MAKING IS LITERAL GARBAGE BOTH IN GAME AND REAL LIFE, EVETUALLY, THEIR PUSHING BECAME TOO MUCH WITH NAGA EMBER AND NATURES ALL PUSHING A LANE WITH TPS AND WE LOST THANKS TO YOU. YOU THREW A NINETY GAME BECAUSE YOUR ACTUALLY AUTISTIC, YOU SHOULD HAVE NEVER BEEN ALLOWED TO PLAY RANKED MMR. I ACTUALLY DON'T KNOW HOW THE FUCK YOUR EVEN ABOVE 3K MMR WHEN YOUR TRASH DECISIONS THREW THE GAME, I ACTUALLY HOPE AT THE VERY LEAST YOUR FINGERS GOT FUCKED UP SO EVEN IF YOU PLAY DOTA, YOUR MMR WILL TANK UNTIL YOUR PLAYING WITH THE TRENCH THAT NEVER BUYS BOOTS AND CONSTANTLY FEEDS UNDER TOWER, THANKS AND FUCK YOU So I am around 3k trash. I am trash and I know it. I know I can play cores but since the usual trash can't supp for shit I'll support. I pick Ogre. I roam the shit out of the map, we lead 30 TO FUCKING 0, ZERO by minute 15. Not a single enemy gets feed. 60 MINUTES LATER, WE LOST THE GAME. WE LITERALLY HAD TO TAKE ONE MORE RANGED RACKS FOR MEGAS. WE HAD SD, THE SIEGING MACHINE, WE HAD SNIPER, THE SIEGE TANK OF DOTA. AND WE HAD KUNKKA, THE USELESS CUNT. So what do they do? EXACTLY. They start suiciding for chip damage to the racks, they start suiciding on the map for possible support kills. They start feeding the Morph, Legion and Drow that will later start fucking us. THEY DONT BUY EVASION, NEITHER BKBs, Mirana KEEPS SUICIDING INTO LEGION BLADEMAIL. SNIPER DOES NOT KNOW THE ITEM DRAGON LANCE. I WANT TO GRIND MMR. I WANT TO WIN. I WANT TO SUPPORT MY TEAM. BUT WHAT CAN I LITERALLY DO WHEN MY TEAM STARTS SPLITTING UP AND FEEDING LIKE TURDS? WHAT CAN I DO AGAINST 3 BKBs? I would like to apply as a mod because my emote was removed and i will ban/kick who ever fucks with us or doesn't obey the rules. I do not have experience but I had experience cleaning dishes cuz my mom force me too or clean the house, like moderating hehe. And I'll talk about myself now. I'm Mark. Male. Straight, dont forget about that. 14. I'm diagnosed with bipolar, autism and depression. Not really that serious since I get really calm when I'm playing games. Really didn't have a lot of friends back in Elementary because I did not fit in with the "kids". I played many games back in the 2005-2007. I can remember playing on my PS2 and you can tell I play a lot of games. First game I could remember was Warcraft 3. Then some other games. Oh maybe also Chicken Invaders and Pacman. Great games on the Windows XP. "Work, Work" Man memories of the Dota mod multiplayer servers. Too sad that the game died down and some people still play. Mostly its just bots. Diablo 2 even died down and theres some people playing. Almost all of them are bots. I played Counter Strike 1.6 and Source. Pirated them few years back and I'd say I have good skills playing. Usually I just slack off school. Not even kidding man. I kinda hate my teachers. I sometimes get bullied. Get called names. Hey, sometimes people be kind to me. I have lots of games but i'm not that rich so don't beg me games or items rawr xd. I also have lots of anime posters. Hehe like Re:zero, love live, death note. My favorite anime is Jojo's Bizarre Adventure. Ya kno? Where the stands appear then the big muscle guys fight. "ZA WARDO!" "ORA ORA ORA" "MUDA MUDA MUDA" Season 3 is my favourite. Old guys just having adventures hehe. Joseph Joestar is a great character. The 5th manga looks like a bunch of gay dudes with weird haircuts. Ok so the mod part. A mod would have responsibilities. "Respect users, warn/ban gay heads" Thank you for reading and hopefully you will accept me for a future moderator. Let me just rant real quick about this because it's finally come up in a sub that people will agree with me in. Esports are not sports. It's not a fucking sport so stop fucking calling it one. These little twigs are not athletes and they don't need dri-fit "jerseys" with their names on em, because jerseys with names and numbers serve an actual function when you're running around on a field, not so much when you're glued to a $1000 chair. I'm sick of people calling e-sports "the new sports". It's not a fucking sport. I'm typing this on the toilet right now and that's about as much movement as is being done when playing fucking Dota 2. Just because you put a couple thousand people in a stadium, still, doesn't make it a sport and I'm sick of gaming nerds comparing this shit to real, actual sports. I'm not some jock. I play rocket league. But im sick of this new movement to try and pretend like video games are inherently good the way actual sports are. If your kid plays sports, he's physicslly active and he's being social and it's healthy for him. DotA fuckin 2 can't replace that. I just needed to get that out of my system. I was only 13 years old I loved Gaben so much, I had all the Dota 2 cosmetics and followed all the Half-Life 3 rumors I pray to Gaben every night before bed, thanking him for the highly-discounted games I’ve been given "Gaben is love" I say; “Gaben is life” My dad hears me and calls me a pretentious shill I know he was just jealous of my superior gaming platform I called him a console peasant He slaps me and sends me to go to sleep I’m crying now, and my face hurts I lay in bed and it’s really cold Suddenly, a warmth is moving towards me It’s Gaben I am so happy He whispers into my ear “This is my consumer-friendly DRM.” He grabs me with his powerful hands and puts me down onto my hands and knees I’m ready I spread my wallet for Gaben He penetrates my bank account It hurts so much but I do it for Gaben I can feel my account balance dropping as my Steam library increases I add more items to my wishlist I want to please Gaben He roars in a mighty roar as he fills my library with cheap indie games My dad walks in Gaben looks him straight in the eyes and says “It’s all on sale now.” Gaben leaves through my window Gaben is love. Gaben is life. Why you just don't use rapture on, uhh, I dunno, whadafak why you just don't use rapture on fucken w-- on fucken shaker?! WHAT DA FUCK IS PROBLEM? YOU JUST PICK CORE BLOODSEEKER AND YOU JUST DON'T DO ANYTHING ON THE GAME, HELLO? DUDE! USE RAPTURE ON FUCKEN--uhh shaker I dunno, you just stupid, you just most stupidest dog ever saw in the Dota pool. I must confess, I play league because I have foot fetish. When I saw screenshots of LoL with Janna in them, I instantly knew it was my type of game. I used to play Dota, but I didn't like it very much because of lack of barefoot female champions there. Lina looked like she could be my type of champion, but unfortunately she has such ugly and long feet that it wasn't even funny. Then there was Enchantress, but her hooves ruined any appeal for me. LoL, on the other hand, immediately drew my attention as the game that put a lot of detail into the things I like. My favorite champion in LoL is obviously Janna. Her appearance, clothes and, most importantly, her feet are perfect. I play Janna very often, but I must admit I sometimes lose focus in early game when I get.. 'a rocket in my pocket' after zooming in on her feet when the game starts in the spawn. My only problem is she does not walk with her feet. I wish i could see them in action rather than floating. My second favourite champion is Nidalee. While Janna's feet ignite my desire directly, Nidalee soft and pleasant looking fur boots teases me with their massive size, hinting at a great bountiful pair of feet. I also like how Nidalee throws her javelin, how she leans forward, stepping forward for a delightful moment, and doing a double-take. Sometimes it turns me on, sometimes not. I like Riven, but I have to say that her feet are not so good in comparison to my two favorites, but I fancy her anyway. It seems that Riven runs a lot so her feet must be very rough so she must wear sandals. She is still cool though. I would appreciate a skin that could change her legs and feet to look more feminine and preferably, bare. I don't know if Morgana's feet are good or not because I couldn't see them no matter how I tried to move her around, I was greatly disappointed. Anyway, I'm looking forward to the future LoL developments and I hope there will be more beautiful barefoot female heroes. League did an amazing job for people like me and I'm going to play and support this game however I can. ill have you fuckers know that league is 10x better than dota. if you want to talk then fucking fight me right now. ill have you know i main syndra and will literally fucking pummel you into the ground. dota sucks dick and sniper is ass. i dont care if it came out before league, cause the graphics are dick. dota will always be garbage and you should just kill yourself if you play it still. Ever since has started significantly acknowledging this subreddit and the game has gone popular it's been all downhill. Seriously, how the fuck does anyone think that the majority will legitimately assess the meta game and situations about some heroes when about 1% of the DotA 2 player base actually plays the ''real'' meta game and an even smaller percentage of players understands how everything affects everything? (very high skilled captain players). I'm 6000+ and I don't even try to pretend that my suggestions about the metagame could lead it to a better place and so do most of us. It's just fucking mind boggling how so many players who can barely play the fucking game properly try to promote their awful ideas with any form of legitimacy and we encourage them. Oh and the memes. This place used to laugh about twitch chat unironically but I'm not sure that's a possibility anymore. Every 2-3 threads is filled with nothing but meme based retardation that just goes on and on. Every single fucking time there's a discussion about whether or not we should add a new feature to the game the top comment's ALWAYS ''BUT MUH SKILL CAP'' like we can't have a legitimate discussion cause there's too many degenerated fucktards who can only communicate through memes. And after that you wonder why most pros dont bother to come and discuss on this shithole. I'm sure if some came undercover you'd find ways to downvote them to oblivion to upvote some 3K'er brilliant fucking thoughts. Stop being so fucking kneejerk all the time. Appreciate the game, try to use English properly. End of rant. TL;DR ---> So few people are actually good and dota and understand the game properly (like maybe a 1000) stop acting like this shithole actually has good ideas and stay humble, love the game, stop mindlessly spewing memes.

Niggers die on average at around 40, which some might say is 40 years too late, but there you go. Most people prefer their niggers dead, in fact. When yours dies, report the license number of the car that did the drive-by shooting of your nigger. The police will collect the nigger and dispose of it for you.

Feel better about yourself, little bitch? You're little cunt living in your parent's house, talking shit. You r/incel bitches love to piss and moan about girls being so mean. What's the term, "Stacy?" Who picked that name, an alpha cunt mod who got rejected in High School? Why don't you suck each other's dicks, like you really want to? You might as well, no female is ever going to touch you. It's 2017. No one cares, really. Call Bruce, have him come over, watch 300, and make out. Queer people are accepted by any rational person, now. At least then others would respect you for being who you really are.

OH BOY here we go again with the losers thinking they have it worst. When I was 7 my mother abandoned me in an African jungle and I was constantly being raped by lions and monkeys. After that I moved into a village where I was constantly slashed and deprived of sleep from the locals. On top of that I just found out I had autism. It's terminal.

The past 2 weeks we have been talking about consent and were discussing about the legal age of having sexual interaction. For some of my fellow classmates it was quite awkward i would say. Also we have discussed about “love” and “like” somebody and what is the difference. Our Tutor teacher (Mr Tabone) and my classmates were disliking the videos we have watched because they were not true at all. We also had a box and we could ask any question what we wanted to but several people did not answer and gave blank papers in. One of the question was “How to do make your crush like you.” Filip needed to answer the question and in conclusion we have came up with that it’s about the person if he/she likes you or not. Tadeas also got one question but he was sick when he needed to answer a question from the box. The next topic we covered in these 2 weeks were friendships. The videos we watched on Friendships were totally off our classes expectations. Thank you for reading this blog :-)

Lol, do you realize that being knowledgeable in these areas is not the same as having a high IQ. A person could have a much higher IQ than yours and not know much about any of these topics, yet know about a bunch of other things that you know very little about. IQ tests do not test for subject matter expertise because they are not testing to see what you already know but an individual's ability to deduce new information from abstract rules and engage in abstract reasoning. It tests for visual-spatial processing and auditory processing, as well as short-term memory, and processing speed. Knowing about theoretical physics, nihilism, Narodnaya Volya, and a bunch information that make you enjoy Rick & Morty more, doesn't mean you have a high IQ, it means you are knowledgeable in these areas. I have only watched 3 episodes of Rick and Morty, but your comment was just over the top. Anyway, you are conflating two things, knowledge expertise in philosophy, science, and physics with IQ. There is a correlation but not the same.

No one who has any real credentials says that stuff that's called Stolen Valor and it's a crime. You can be arrested for saying that. Never lie about being in the service again that's bullshit dude, not cool at all. People die for this country and your out here saying you have '300' confirmed kills? You are a nobody who sits behind his computer and rants. But Stolen Valor is real, and that's what you just did.

To be fair, you have to have a very high IQ to play pyro. The playstyle is extremely complicated, and without a solid grasp of theoretical physics most of the abilities will go over a typical player's head. There's also pyro's cheery outlook, which is deftly woven into its characterisation - its personal philosophy draws heavily from My Little Pony, for instance. The fans understand this stuff; they have the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate the depths of these playstyles, to realize that they're not just effective- they can wipe entire enemy teams. As a consequence people who dislike pyro truly ARE idiots- of course they wouldn't appreciate, for instance, the humour in Pyro's existencial catchphrase "Mmph mph mmmpphmmph," which itself is a cryptic reference to Turgenev's Russian epic Fathers and Sons I'm smirking right now just imagining one of those addlepated simpletons scratching their heads in confusion as Robin Walker's genius unfolds itself on their computer screens. What fools... how I pity them. 😂 And yes by the way, I DO have a phlogistinstor tattoo. And no, you cannot see it. It's for the ladies' eyes only- And even they have to demonstrate that they're within 5 IQ points of my own (preferably lower) beforehand.

I am a huge Woody Allen fan. Although I've only seen "Antz." But I'll tell you something, what I respect about that man is that when he was going through all of that stuff that came out in the press, about how "Antz" was just a ripoff of "A Bug's Life," he stayed true to his films. Or at least the film that I saw, which, again, was "Antz." Thing is, I thought "A Bug's Life" was better, much better than "Antz." Point is, don't listen to your critics. Listen to your fans.

Here’s why I’m annoyed. First of all: FUCK. OFF. with hating on Rick and Morty fans. I understand that your irrelevant, brainless leaders like Pewdiepie or Jake Paul or WHOEVER THE FUCK might feign superiority by attempting to DRAG the  inherently superior intellectuals through the fucking mud. I understand that it might seem fucking comical to an immature VIRGIN kid to make fun of those you wish you could be. What I will NEVER FUCKING UNDERSTAND, however, is how you can ADMIT and BE PROUD of your complete IDIOCY! You Mortys quake in your pants when us Ricks come around-- your ass-sweat releasing another droplet with every step we take towards you. You are TOOLS to us! It’s hilarious and MIND-BOGGLING that you attempt to insult your creators, and fail to appreciate or even ACKNOWLEDGE that there are literally MILLIONS of you replaceable, sheepish worms in infinite timelines. My appetite is satiated purely by the satisfaction of watching you attempt to find fulfillment as a useless, useless Morty. You are NOTHING! But go ahead-- keep laughing at your little jokes. You only make it easier to eventually brainwash you and bend you to the sadistic desires us RICKS possess. Enjoy what you believe to be freedom. Us Ricks will continue to serve ourselves and reap the benefits of your utter stupidity-- I AM PICKLE RICK MUTHAFUCKA!!! SHAKE THAT FUCKING ASS FOR ME YOU SLAVE! YOU JERRY! I hope you enjoy your ‘memes’ you fucking imbeciles. Have a nice day of unimportance :)

To be honest, Filthy Frank and Pink Guy were merely catalysts for Joji to kick off his career as a muscian. 

He utilized the opportunity of shock value and the title of "walking internet cancer" to get him the recognition and musical attention he so rightfully deserved. 

I give the man some serious fucking props, he stuck his neck out super hard despite the potential risks of ridicule and fucking climbed the ladder. 

Joji, you got some balls of steel and a soul of passion. No matter what kind of content you put out, I will always follow you mutually out of respect and for the dedication you have in your heart.

The thing is, people don't realize the work that goes into properly doing copypasta. They think copypasta is something that slackers can do, or faggots, or assholes. It's not true. Copypasta is a dying artform and if you don't see that, I don't know what's wrong with you. 

First of all, you sacrifice spending real time on reddit. You can't participate as much as you'd like to because you're so busy doing copypasta that you can't. As a result, you miss a lot of really greatthreads. Still, it's a sacrifice, so you do it. 

There's also the problem of "Flood detected". This message can really hurt your progress. You should try to get your copypasta into every active thread and if you have to sit there waiting before the flood period is over, you lose valuable time. This is also very difficult. 

Also, picking which threads should get a copypasta first are sort of difficult. There are threads that don't stay on the first page for very long, so you may be missing some of the more prominent threads. Of course, you should try to hit them all, but for the desire effect, you need to get into bigger threads quickly. 

Finally, there's the moral problem. One thing about copypasta is that sometimes it feels good, but sometimes it feels bad.

Does anyone else relate to the "rick" character from the new "hit" show called "rick and morty" people who dont relate to "rick" I first think they have a low IQ (which most times they do.) you invertabrates you "normies" you "faggots" who dont get the new "hit" show called "rick and morty" dont get its relatable jokes about science and the world like beth and jerry (Hate jerry BTW) I will have a grandson one day just like "morty" from "rick and morty" and a retarded daddy in law... i dont think people know how to relate to jokes from rick and morty... go back to watching spongebob.. :smirk: :pensive: :pensive:

This is so damn nasty and if you the children of Israel God gonna kill you eating this shit. He told us not to eat it. It's in Leviticus 11. All they cooking is water bugs. Lobster, shrimp, crayfish, crabs in the same family as cockroaches. Don't believe me look it up. One is on land and one in the water. So next time you see a cockroach, roach or those big water bugs. Catch it and do the same that he's doing. It's no difference. That's a water cockroach that you dumb ass people say is a delicacy. If you won't eat the one on land why would you eat the one in water? They do the same thing eat shit and dead stuff on land and the other in water. Keep listening to the white man instead of God he's gonna get you put to death smh

Taking down the "Clinton Machine" is not as easy as everyone would like it to seem. 

This is Hilary Clinton we are talking about, not just an average politician. Arresting and sending Hilary Clinton to prison is not as simple as 1, 2, 3. 

There is a massive spider web that she has created and if anyone were to take her down, they'd have to do it methodically and meticulously. Trump has all the evidence he needs to send her to prison tomorrow if he wanted to, but even if he did with the evidence he has now, there is without a doubt so much more evidence to be uncovered. 

Taking her down, as I said before, needs to be done methodically and carefully. It can not be done quickly and with haste.

She's a monster. You don't kill the boss on the first try... you power up and make sure that when you do face the boss, there is no chance in hell that anything will get in your way...

>The audience laughs heartily

They start pissing themselves from laughter, which fails to put out the flames but makes everything smell like burnt hair and urine. An older gentleman has a heart attack and dies on the floor, burning and covered in piss. The earth trembles below the studio, opening a gaping crack into the underbelly of the earth. Several members of the audience are dragged into the blackness, laughing so hard blood spills from their mouths as they descend into the molten core of the earth, smashing into the rock as they fall. The continued laughter echoes off the rock, causing the largest known earthquake in history, crippling the powergrids of several of the world's major cities, plunging humankind into darkness for weeks. Martial law is called into effect as the riots increase in size and aggressiveness.

To be fair, you have to have a very high IQ to understand Bernie Sanders. His politics are extremely subtle, and without a solid grasp of Democratic Socialism most of his policy positions will go over a typical low-information voter's head. There’s also Bernie’s revolutionary outlook, which is deftly woven into his platform- his personal philosophy draws heavily from Bolshevik literature, for instance. Millennials understand this stuff; they have the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate the depths of his legislation, to realise that they’re not just renaming a post office- they say something deep about LIFE. As a consequence people who dislike Bernie Sanders truly ARE idiots- of course they wouldn’t appreciate, for instance, the humour in Bernie’s existential catchphrase “Millyuhnares and billyuhnares,” which itself is a cryptic reference to Marx's epic Das Kapital. I’m smirking right now just imagining one of those establishment simpletons scratching their heads in confusion as Bernie Sanders' genius wit unfolds itself on their Twitter feeds. What fools.. how I pity them. 😂

And yes, by the way, i DO have a Bernie Sanders tattoo. And no, you cannot see it. It’s for the ladies’ eyes only- and even then they have to demonstrate that they don't just vote with their vaginas beforehand. Nothin personnel kid 😎

I am a 22 year old lonely horny skinny cripple guy who adds random women whom I find attractive (Ones with mutual friends who come up on fb suggestions). If they accept I usually message them trying strike up conversations or convey my interest in some way, typically directly. Then they respond generally with some sort of criticism of my approach before rejecting me, trying to cut me out as some asshole so they don't feel bad for not being interested in a cripple. I have not done this for awhile. I may in fact reuse this at my convenience because there's only so many ways that I can articulate the same thing and it is rather time consuming t type out a message like this and think of something new or unique every time and yet say the same thing. Hopefully I don't have to! 🙂 😜

The Secondary Vice Principal of your school, Mr. Tariq Bell, has blatantly copied and taken credit for an idea that was born in the school he worked at previously. Mr. Bell worked at West Island School in Hong Kong for many years, and is well aware of the "Horizons Week" program that is an distinct aspect of West Island's culture and identity. To see his "original" and "genuine" idea being implemented at another school - along with every single detail of it, including the name, purpose and even the 5 C's, is truly despicable.

 West Island School has been implementing Horizons Week for decades, and has put in blood, sweat, and tears into ensuring its success (which I'm sure you would understand considering that if Mr. Bell "knew all the work that was involved, [he] might have thought it wasn't such a good idea).

In case you need extra guidance to run the program, here is a helpful website with all the work already done for you:
http://www.wis.edu.hk/what-is-horizons-week/

"A Play in a Week" (7:45) is not an original concept, in fact it is the exact activity mentioned in the official West Island School Horizons Week booklet:
http://web.wis.edu.hk/public_html/HorizonsBooklet2016_web/mobile/index.html#p=9

Also, if you take 5 seconds out of your precious time, you would see that the 5 C's that your school values so deeply, are actually on the West Island School homepage, word-for-word:
http://www.wis.edu.hk/mission-statement/

Although, we may consider adding a sixth C - that being "Copyright".﻿

i have made the One True Garfield Timeline. 
basically, there is a nuclear war that may or may not occur. 
if it doesn't garfield continues normal life in his comics before dying and resetting the universe
if it does happen and garfield lives, he falls into a coma and the same thing happens
if it does happen and garfield dies, he goes through the 9 circles of hell and a final challenge before ascending to a being able to possess people as a costume
depending on his death different things happen
if it does happen and garfield dies, he goes through the 9 circles of hell and a final challenge before ascending to a being able to possess people as a costume
depending on his death different things happen
fire- resetting of universe
other means- goes through hell again
sacrifice- gets choice to either reset the universe or stay in hell, meaning the universe has the potential to never reset, encounter heat death, and give garfield his true end

Last year a friend of mine upgraded
GirlFriend 6.0 to Wife 1.0 and found that it's
a memory hog leaving very little system
resources for other applications. He is only
now noticing that Wife 1.0 is also spawning
Child-Processes, which are further
consuming valuable resources.

No mention of these particular phenomena
was included in the product brochure or the
documentation, though other users have
informed him that this is to be expected due
to the nature of the application. 

Not only that, Wife 1.0 installs itself, i.e. it is always
launched at system initialization where it can
monitor all other system activity.

He's finding that some applications such as
PokerNight 10.3, BeerBash 2.5 and PubNight
7.0 are no longer able to run, crashing the
system when selected (even though they
always worked fine before). 

To make matters worse, the uninstall
program for Girlfriend 1.0 doesn't work very
well leaving undesirable traces of the
application in the system. Another problem
is that all versions of Girlfriend continually
popup annoying messages about the
advantages of upgrading to Wife 1.0.

The fuck are you on about?  Great movie.  It finally establishes an origin point for everything and explains SO MUCH the show originally glossed over when it was a TV show.

Zordon's actual relationship to the Rangers, explained.

Why he's actually in the tube and how he got there, explained.

Why despite being mentioned more than a number of times that he could come back but he doesn't, explained.

Why Rita and Zordon go so far back, explained.

How the powers work, explained.

What the power coins are, explained.

It even has cameos from some of the original MMPR and allusions to episodes from the TV show.

I feel like this movie gets a lot of unjust hate, just because it was darker than the original TV series and they changed how some things look or feel and the fact is isn't MMPR.

While this may not be a 10/10 movie, it was definitely better than expected and it gives the lore an actual grounding point that's built off of, that expand into what we know as the MMPR.

And don't forget, this isn't some silly spin off.  This was done by Haim Saban, the orignal creator.  It's canon, baby.

As a redditor who has experienced sexual harassment/assault a couple of times, I think normies making comments like this is ridiculous and offensive. 

I'm not very knowledgeable about the "me me" movement because my whole purpose of Reddit is "Funny" Trump videos but I can almost guarantee you that this is not a "fad" that is meant to make normies like shit because that is not what most people want from them publically memeing about their negative experiences. What most people want is to show others that they are always alone and they do have to hate themselves for what happened... or to bring to light how common this behaviour really is. If you were negatively affected by some thot brushing up against you I have as much sympathy for you as ANY redditor who has experienced something similar and I personally believe you do have just as much of a right to contribute to this sub if not more because so many normies experience assault of varying degrees and never say anything about it which creates a negative cycle of self-hate and shame. 

Be the negative individual who has to try to bash down a positive thing. If you can't appreciate what its all about then don't leave it alone and don't educate yourself.

Praseodymium is the third member of the lanthanide series. In the periodic table, it appears between the lanthanides cerium to its left and neodymium to its right, and above the actinide protactinium. It is a ductile metal with a hardness comparable to that of silver. Its 59 electrons are arranged in the configuration [Xe]4f^3 6s^2; theoretically, all five outer electrons can act as valence electrons, but the use of all five requires extreme conditions and normally, praseodymium only gives up three or sometimes four electrons in its compounds. Praseodymium is the first of the lanthanides to have an electron configuration conforming to the Aufbau principle, which predicts the 4f orbitals to have a lower energy level than the 5d orbitals; this does not hold for lanthanum and cerium, because the sudden contraction of the 4f orbitals does not happen until after lanthanum, and is not strong enough at cerium to avoid occupying the 5d subshell. Nevertheless, solid praseodymium takes on the [Xe]4f^2 5d^1 6s^2 configuration, with one electron in the 5d subshell like all the other trivalent lanthanides (all but europium and ytterbium, which are divalent in the metallic state).

Like most lanthanides, praseodymium usually only uses three electrons as valence electrons, as afterwards the remaining 4f electrons are too strongly bound: this is because the 4f orbitals penetrate the most through the inert xenon core of electrons to the nucleus, followed by 5d and 6s, and this increases with higher ionic charge. Praseodymium nevertheless can continue losing a fourth and even occasionally a fifth valence electron because it comes very early in the lanthanide series, where the nuclear charge is still low enough and the 4f subshell energy high enough to allow the removal of further valence electrons. Thus, similarly to the other early trivalent lanthanides, praseodymium has a double hexagonal close-packed crystal structure at room temperature. At about 560 °C, it transitions to a face-centered cubic structure, and a body-centered cubic structure appears shortly before the melting point of 935 °C.

Praseodymium, like all of the lanthanides (except lanthanum, ytterbium, and lutetium, which have no unpaired 4f electrons), is paramagnetic at room temperature. Unlike some other rare-earth metals, which show antiferromagnetic or ferromagnetic ordering at low temperatures, praseodymium is paramagnetic at all temperatures above 1 K.

OMG. I just remembered that I fooled around with a cousin on the day I learned what sex was. I was probably 7. I found my ~15 year old cousin's dirty mags. He and a friend explained everything they knew -- and they had a lot of it wrong, I later learned.  

That night, I was so hard thinking about all the stuff he'd told me. I woke him up -- I was sleeping in the same bed with him that night visiting from out of town. I begged him, and he eventually relented and agreed to pull down his underwear so that our penises could touch for maybe 10 seconds. I also wanted to sit on him for a second cowgirl style while keeping our underwear on. He let me do that as well.

And then I was satisfied -- I think I thought there would be like unicorns or rainbows or something, because he had told me that sex was the most fun thing anybody could ever do, "better than going to Six Flags."

I don't think about that very often. It was like as innocent as you can get -- but something that would probably freak any adult out to the point of calling CPS or whatever if they walked in on us. lol

We're old now and I see him pretty often. i will probably never ask him if he remembers that.

To be fair, you have to have a very high IQ to play pyro.

sigh, another crybaby who isn't skilled enough to play the game.

- if the hog was *that* OP, everybody at the top of the ladder would have been playing hog for the past year and a half
- you're complaining that the hog can jump the river (pig push is the same thing as a river-jump). that's literally the hog's 'gimmick' - every card has something that makes it special - river-jumping is what the hog does
- 'auto pig push'. you do realize that the "pig push" used to be a bug with the old map/targeting system, right? the hog was meant to always jump over the river. having to push the hog to the side, was just a workaround for the glitch.
- some units, like the dart goblin are also able to snipe buildings without crossing the river - even if the buildings are planted 4-tiles from the river. there is no 'universal building plant'. The Battle ram also ignores a 4-4 plant. You can still do a 3-4 plant and draw every hog (and battle ram) with a cannon.
- there are many other units that do way more damage than the hog. Literally every other win condition does more damage than the hog (giant, battle ram, ebarbs, graveyard, you name it)
- there are other cards that are 'very fast' as well, not just the hog. afaik a lumberjack does almost the same amount of damage to a tower than a hog.

if you would all come down from your anti-hog circlejerk for once, you'd understand that you people are the reason why CR is going to shit, because you keep complaining and complaining, until supercell nerfs perfectly balanced cards and turns them to shit, like the Royal Giant. I never really played that card myself, but it's basically trash now, because it was nerfed too death.

there are tons of cards that can absolutely demolish and deny the hog for a positive elixir trade. look at the stats. the hog isn't even among the top-10 when it comes to winrate in arena 11. All the hog decks that have the most win-percentages are rocket/fireball cycle decks featuring the knight. maybe you'd understand that the problem isn't the hog, the problem are cards like archers and the knight. These cards are extremely low-cost, they don't give you any spell value and they can distract most of your units for a positive trade.

Supercell realized this too, that's why they buffed the Valkyrie, to separate her from the knight. Unfortunately they don't understand that being able to one-shot a princess, isn't really the reason why anybody chooses the knight over the Valkyrie.

Seriously, LOOK AT THE STATS, before you complain about cards being too powerful, because in 9 out of 10 cases, the problem is YOU, who doesn't know how to properly play the game and counter certain cards/decks

first of all don't you dare assume anyone uses drugs. I have not ever in my life touched or been around drugs. and don't thing your above everyone now that you snitched and all the adults love you for doing the "right" thing. your just sucking up to get yourself out of the limelight. what secrets are you hiding is what everyone should be asking.

To be fair, you have to have a very high IQ to understand squeaky ball. The game is extremely subtle, and without a solid grasp of hunting most of the throws will go over a typical doggo’s head. There’s also the ball’s squeaky outlook, which is deftly woven into its characterisation- its noise draws heavily from me when the postman comes, for instance. The good boys understand this stuff; they have the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate biting the ball, to realise that they’re not just good- they say something deep about LIFE. As a consequence people who dislike squeaky ball truly ARE idiots- of course they wouldn’t appreciate, for instance, the excitement in the ball’s existential catchphrase “SQUEEK,” which itself is a cryptic reference to how prey tends to make squeaky noises. I’m dropping my ears right now just imagining one of those addlepated simpletons burying their heads in confusion as ball thrower’s genius wit unfolds itself into the other room. What fools.. how I pity them. 🐶

And yes, by the way, i DO have a ball in my mouth. And no, you cannot see it. It’s for the ladies’ eyes only- and even then they have to demonstrate that they’re within 5 good points of my own (preferably lower) beforehand. Nothin personnel pupper 🐶

To be fair, you have to have a very high IQ to understand Dino Strippers. The humor is extremely subtle, and without a solid grasp of theoretical sexuality most of the jokes will go over a typical viewer's head. There's also Dino Stripper's hedonistic outlook, which is deftly woven into her characterisation - her personal philosophy draws heavily from vintage erotica, for instance. The fans understand this stuff; they have the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate the depths of these jokes, to realize that they're not just funny- they say something deep about LIFE. As a consequence people who dislike Dino Stripper truly ARE idiots- of course they wouldn't appreciate, for instance, the humour in Dino Stripper's existencial dance "grinding in the club," which itself is a cryptic reference to the old burlesque houses of early 20th century France I'm smirking right now just imagining one of those addlepated simpletons scratching their heads in confusion as Dan Harmon's genius unfolds itself on their television screens. What fools... how I pity them. And yes by the way, I DO have a Dino Stripper tattoo. And no, you cannot see it. It's for the ladies' eyes only- And even they have to demonstrate that they're within 5 IQ points of my own (preferably lower) beforehand.

It has been 4 hours since I successfully sucked my own penis. Things are different now. As soon as mouth-to-penis contact was made I felt a shockwave through my body. I have reason to believe I have super strength and telekinesis now.. 3 hours after contact I noticed a van parked on my street but no one has entered or exited the car since its arrival. I fear for my safety, I'm not sure what sort of power I may have stumbled upon but it's possible that the government has found out. If I don't update this again please send help.

I'm not sure how I can come out like this, or how to even fabricate my unorthodox emotions into words. But here goes; I am a minion.
Every morning I meet up with my friends, and say "bello". The looks of despair I am greeted with mixed with the utmost disgust upsets me deeply. Just because I speak minionease.
I look in the mirror and shed a tear as I wish I was 4 feet smaller, and had only 1 eye. Kevin, Stuart and even Bob to an extent have always been role models of mine due to how well they act and the humour they exhibit.
Please don't be a hater and say that I am a troll punk, because even us minions have feelings too.

Minecraft is really about the holocaust and I can prove why.

You, in the regular realm on the Earth. You're a curious child. Reading books and fighting off animals trying to survive. One day, you make a  "portal" called the nether. The nether is suppose to be a simulation is hell. But what you don't realize, is in reality, the nether in Europe, more known as the Netherlands, was hell in the past. As you enter in the portal, you go back in time to the holocaust.  The Netherlands was hell. People were hiding from the nazis. That's why the blazes are hiding from you. They don't know who you are. They don't recognize you. So they think you're a nazi. But when you step outside, the ghasts attack out because they think you're a Jew. Why is the ground red? It is the blood of the Jews. So you go back to the regular world, thinking everything is fine. You make a portal to "The End". You enter into the portal and you see the dragon. The dragon is hitler and you are the Jew. That is why he is attacking you. Why is the ground all white and gray?  Because that is the ashes from all the Jews. He is stepping on the ashes. That is why there is so much "end stone".  Why are there pillars with fire on it?  It is because that is the oven to burn the Jews. You go back to your realm and live a peaceful life.

I used to masturbate onto birds at a local park. Not a thing that I'm particularly proud of but I became quite good at it. I was taking zinc supplements so I was shooting massive loads and it became something of a sport to me. For anyone interested here is your best strategy. first, you need to find an isolated spot so you don't become a sex offender. I found a short kind of channel area where I saw the pigeons would congregate. Next, you arouse yourself. I was usually content with envisioning the occasional jogging lady coming over and taking a shit on my chest and that was enough to fuel the fire but if you're not as sexually charged as me just take some porn on the go. After you're good an horny, you get some bread. My pigeons preferred white bread but healthier birds might have a taste for honey wheat or maybe even multigrain. Fat, unhealthy birds are slower and easier to hit so remember that. Once you are seated on the bench and ready to do the deed, whip your roosevelt out and scatter bread out within a few feet of you. use your judgement based on how far you know you can cum. I was a lonely and depraved soul who could hit targets the size of a thimble at distances up to 4 feet. You wait for the pigeons to begin eating and to get comfortable with your presence. At this point, you want to coo gently and talk sensually to them to gain their trust. Now you're finally ready to cum on your bird. This is a tough part because the rapid motion of masturbation is very frightening to the birds, so you have to be subtle. Once you master a technique, you simply wind it up and let it go, aiming depending on your past cumming experiences. I always came high so I would aim for the neck of the bird and catch it right in the face. It's an extremely satisfying and erotic feeling, seeing those birds reel around covered in cum and maybe even transporting it to other places in the city. Either way I haven't done it in years but every now and then I catch myself gazing wistfully at a flock of birds, cock throbbing and waiting for them to land close to me.

I'm pretty sure I don't currently have a "mentor," as I understand that expression. I have a great many academic, scientific, entertainment, and engineering colleagues whose council and advice I seek routinely. It's just that I'm the grownup now, with the experience, leastways, I'm supposed to be. I have colleagues more than a mentor. Carry on.

I don't support relationships between siblings, child and parent, etc. When it comes to that, yes, it's very much wrong. When it comes to cousins however, I did some research. I looked at it from a scientific perspective, cultural perspective, historical perspective, etc. I looked at it from pretty much every single angle there is. After that, I came to the conclusion that there is little to nothing wrong with cousins being in a relationship. I don't mind. It's other people's choice as to how they want to live their lives. If someone wants to be in a relationship with their cousin, that's fine. It's their choice.

In regards to Ben 10, it's a work of fiction. The characters in the show do not exist in real life. They are fictional characters. That is one of the major factors as to why I'm fine with the Bwen shipping.

I'm not even going to make a good comment, but I will bask in the glory of gold.

Edit: several minutes and no gold. Sad!

Edit2: wow rood -70? This is a violation of my free speech

Edit3: wow rude reports hurt my feelings :(

Edit5: sad refditors downvoting innocuous demands. Sad!

Edit6: wow 420 donwotes? Clearly Reddit is being gamed by George Soros.

Edit7: clearly this is linked to pizzagate. It's right in front of your eyes people!

Edit8: Clinton just contacted me and assured me that this is in fact not linked to pizzagate

Edit9: the gold came, but only after my super insightful hypothesis that Soros is behind this. This is a clear attempt to buy my trust!

Edit10: Target has a great price on tin foil. Just saying.

Edit11: the lizard ppl are running a conspiracy against me. Can't even place an order on 20 miles of tin foil without the Target personnel getting "suspicious" and stating bullshit like "apologies, sir, but this deal is for a maximum of two rolls. Also, please put on some pants" and stuff like that. I know what they're doing.

Edit12: Do these capris make me look fat?

Edit13: Wow. So many globalists still downvoting me. Low energy!

Edit14: ShareBlue just won't stop! Pathetic!

Edit 15: to all the haters: booooo uuuuu

When I was growing up in the 1960s and early 1970s, suburbia was home to many women suffering from "housewife derangement syndrome." I think it had something to do with the ennui of tract houses, plus inhaling all that hairspray to support their boofy hairdos.

Anyway, there was a reason why Women's Lib came into being, because many women simply weren't cut out to while away the hours, applying rick-rack to ugly, home-made gingham garments for their daughters (the horror!!), playing bridge, vacuuming in housedresses and pearls, or locking their kids in the basement in preparation for greeting their husbands at the front door wearing spike heels and Saran Wrap (to spice up the marriage, you know).

One of our neighbors totally wasn't cut out to be a housewife. I'm not sure what she was cut out to be--something involving stretch pants, bee-hive hairdos, cigarettes in large quantity, and booze in even larger quantities--but her approach to child rearing, particularly during the summer, was to lock her kids out of the house and place food for them on the front steps for lunch so they wouldn't "bother" her during whatever solitary activities occupied her time. (She was also known for keeping the younger kid, who was a boy of my age, in a large cage in the basement after school if the weather was bad so she wouldn't have to "worry about him getting into anything." In her defense, he was kind of awful.)

However, the other neighborhood mothers (sources of many, many other stories that I cannot go into here), cut her some slack and let her kids use their bathrooms (because otherwise they "went" in the bushes, including "number two) because she made really cool Jell-O based salads and was generous about sharing them. My own mother refused to wallow in Jell-O, proclaiming it "cheap," and "the sort of thing people from Indiana eat" (and no -- I never was able to find out from her what the hell she meant by that), but my siblings and I loved the Jell-O and fruit concoctions that our neighborhood lady made!

But that was before I happened to have been invited into her home one day to watch her make one of these masterpieces and, incidentally gaze at the "paint-by-numbers" clown paintings" decorating the walls. (This was what she apparently did when the kids were locked outside. Who'd a thunk it?) Anyway, first, there was the issue of cigarette ash from the cigarettes forever dangling from her white-lipsticked lips, which fell periodically into the half-set lime Jell-O into which she was working an assortment of fruit, and then there was the blood....

The neighbor lady, who I later realized (much later--in college--because my parents never commented on the failings of other adults) had a massive drinking problem, wasn't too good with the knife, and as she cut up peaches and pears and other assorted fruit-stuffs, she repeatedly also cut her fingers. I still have visions of bloody peach slices being pressed into the half-firm Jell-O (it was refrigerated to complete the hardening afterwards), and being utterly, utterly horrified. Especially while I was watching all of my neighbors eat this concoction, the peach slices, globbed with lime Jell-O and probably blood, skewered on forks and happily stuffed into their mouths.

I have avoided Jell-O salads ever since

(From my result for [this] (http://www.crunchyroll.com/anime-feature/2017/11/08/quiz-tell-us-your-favorite-foods-and-well-tell-you-how-youd-fare-at-the-totsuki-academy-from-food-wars?utm_source=community_cr&utm_medium=twitter&utm_campaign=news&referrer=community_cr_twitter_news) Crunchyroll quiz) 

I'm sorry to say it, but you are a truly a food plebeian. You have no understanding of what good food really is, let alone how to make it. You should stay as far away from school as possible, unless you like having your classmates laugh at your abject failures. Don't feel too bad – maybe you can find some other way to occupy your life. For example, attend a normal high school where you don't have to fight for your right to stay in school by winning food competitions every other day. There may be less overall nudity, but at least your life will be relatively calm and uncomplicated.

Everyday I become more and more of an alpha male. 

Being depressed and blackpilled has actually helped my depression and made me happier. I have become manipulative, angry and aggressive. I started lifting and fighting more. I no longer care about death, so I do as I please. I cut in front of a cuck in line at McDonald's today. He said nothing. I ate a bigmac meal, and told his women that she was sexy and that he is a lucky man. I no longer give a fuck. In fact, last night some fat white bitch offered me sex after I bullied some man let bbc when I was drunk and I turned her down. This is what chad must feel like everyday. Getting validated by women, fighting and bullying inferior males, not giving a fuck about anything but his primal desires. I wish this could be me everyday of my life. I would love to live like this, fighting, eating, fucking and then dying by being beaten to death by some genetically superior male. This is life in god mode.

that's not what bonehurtingjuice is, fool; bonehurtingjuice is taking a meme and rewriting the text to depict a NEW IMAGINATION of what is going on in the meme's picture(s), creating a funny, new story that could almost be mistaken for an image created by a child who found the blank meme format and made up a silly story for it.
this post is not bonehurtingjuice. it is an overused meme spread out across an unfunny political cartoon. it doesn't misinterpret what is going on in the image; you or whoever made it put random letters across the image. nothing is being misinterpreted here, it's just "so random lol". you must have seen all the "party rock" misposts and gotten your definition from that. you fucking 12 year olds who lack the cognitive capacity to meme on a higher level ruin all my favorite subs by flocking to them in droves and shitposting and upvoting shitposts to the point where mods can't keep up. this submission is WHACK and you and all the clueless sheeple who upvoted it should be banned from this subreddit and have your genitals mutilated because you SUCK and also fuck you

In any city, in any country, go to any mental institution or halfway house you can get yourself to. When you reach the front desk, ask to visit someone who calls himself "The Holder of the Flame Broiled". Should a look of child-like fear come over the workers face, you will then be taken to a cell in the building. It will be in a deep hidden section of the building. All you will hear is the sound of heavy breathing echoing through the halls. Your very soul will feel unspeakable fear.

Should the breathing stop at any time, STOP and QUICKLY say aloud "I'm just passing through, I wish to snack." If you still hear silence, flee. Leave, do not stop for anything, do not go home, don't stay at an inn, just keep moving, sleep where your body drops. You will know in the morning if you've escaped.

If the breathing in the hall comes back after you utter those words continue on. Upon reaching the cell all you will see is a windowless room with a king in the corner, his mouth frozen into a insane grin, and cradling something. The person will only respond to one question. "What happens when they flame broil it fresh when you order instead of leaving it under a heat lamp?"

The king will then stare into your eyes and say nothing. Many go mad in that very cell, some disappear soon after the meeting, a few end their lives. But most do the worst thing, and eat the object in the king's hands. You will want to as well. Be warned that if you do, your death will be one of high cholesterol and unrelenting hypertension.

Your death will be in that room, by that BK Breakfast Sandwich.

The BK Breakfast Sandwich is 1 of a 6-part value menu. They must never come together. Never.

the questions of are traps gay is more complacated than it may seem so i can see three answers to this question 1. are traps themselves gay/is the person playing the trap gay definitely they are a guy trying to seduce another man 100% gay 2. are you gay for liking the idea of traps it's likely it really depends on the why if it's because they are hiding something from you or you want some sort of surprise then yes but if you like them because they are sticking up to rapists and the likes then no i'd say about 60% gay 3. are you gay for falling for a trap? this time a strong maybe it all depends on how good the trap is for that see this handy chart http://i0.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/original/001/277/855/5a9.jpg hope that answers your question :)

Indian people are wild and free poopers. They are thrifty and consume the least soap of anyone on the planet. Their sacred river, the Ganges, is a festering soup of corrupted corpses with which only they can interact without becoming ill, making it even more sacred. 

Objectively vile creatures, the Poo have secured themselves a niche among the ranks of humans where no other subspecies of man save those from darkest Africa will venture. Like maggots on a corpse soon to transform into majestic green-headed doodoo flies, the Poo are destined to achieve greatness on the world stage and will soon be shitting on the streets of space.

You have to understand that street art (not graffiti; that has negative connotations) is an incredibly important cultural art form that primarily exists as an anti-capitalist message in our country's urban cores. The street art occupies a space left otherwise vacant in the face of capitalist greed and acknowledges both the blight, and difficulties, faced by these marginalized communities. The artist is not lashing out, but is instead reclaiming the existing structure for his/her/xis/xer communities in a space otherwise systemically restrained by the falsities constructed, inherent, and enforced under illegitimate private property laws. He/her/xhe seeks to confront the capitalist class, through street art, in an effort to dismantle these patriarchal and obsolete ideas of property ownership.

I got a question for ya. I got a REAAAAAAAAAALLY stupid question for ya. Something that's been bouncing around in the walls of my mind. I got a... REAL stupid question to ask you here. Do you think that / paper / is a vegetable? Do you think that paper is a vegetable or a fruit? I mean, apples -- apples come from trees. Does that mean that... paper is a fruit? If paper comes from trees, just like APPLES come from trees, does that make it a fruit? However, paper doesn't have any seeds, and one of the defining things about apples and other fruit is that they got seeds in 'em. So that would mean that paper would be something more akin to something like a vegetable. But, iiiiiiiis... paper a vegetable? IS paper a vegetable? Is it? Is it now? IS. IT. A VEGETABLE. Uh, uhh, it's a stupid question, I gotta say it is a very stupid question, but I, uh, want to know. Is paper a vegetable? Now you're gonna tell me, you're gonna sit there -- you're gonna sit there and be smart with me. You're gonna say, "you can't eat paper, idiot," well y'know what, just because something's inedible doesn't mean it's INEDIBLE. If I put paper in my mouth, chew it up and swallow it, sure my body's not gonna be happy with it, but eventually it'll process it and then I'll shit it out. Do I gain any nutrients from it? Probably not, BUT, would it be classified as a vegetable if I ate it, because maple syrup comes from a tree- but that's considered more of a sweet. Maple syrup isn't a vegetable, maple syrup isn't a fruit. SAP isn't a fruit, SAP isn't a vegetable, BUT paper comes from plants.VEGETABLES also come from plants. Do you SEE what's happening in my mind right now, do you SEE this question? This question has been tormenting me, TAUNTING me for days on end, because I know you're not supposed to eat paper, and I know paper isn't -- isn't supposed to be a food, it's not a food, you can't EAT paper, you get nothing FROM it, you're not a fucking cow, cows eat grass, grass isn't a food, grass is a vegetable for cows... is paper a vegetable for -- for goats, or is it a, uh, a general all around vegetable? I gotta, I gotta, I gotta, I GOTTA, I GOTTA, I GOTTA ASK YA.
IS.... paper a vegetable?
Is this like a secret question? Do you think I'll be taking a test in my dreamscape, and the teacher in my dream will say “You got this question wrong, paper IS. a vegetable"? Do you think pa-paper is a- do you think paper is a grain...? Because wood, wood has grain. Do you think PAPER is a grain because wood has grain, when you cut a piece of wood you look at the grain. DO YOU THINK PAPER HAS UH IS IS IS UHH A GRAIN like wheat? Do you think you can make break out of paper? Do you think if you work really hard at it, do you think you could make bread outta paper? Do you think paper is a vegetable or bread? Now I don't know, if you make a paper sandwich, and you take three, three pieces of paper and, and you set 'em down, would that be a pa-p-paper sandwich? DO YOU THINK PAPER IS A VEGETABLE???
DO YOU THINK PAPER IS SgfSfgHfFgddsfFdHsdfsdHFFsfdsVEGGIE?
D-Do you... do you think? Do you think? Do y...

Question for ya: is that a stupid question?﻿

Sure, if you want to ignore the buggy shit that happens with Android, never mind the exploding, never mind the lack of device interplay, never mind the lack of need for a pen when there's talk-to-text or just plain texting (like during class) - or the fact that most people have shit handwriting to begin with.

A Samsung phone can sync my texts to my laptop and tablet all at the same time? Since when, if so?

Apple has the capability of having essentially one operating system across multiple devices, versus just a phone that is singularly more gimmicky. If I want to watch movies, there's a thing called a TV. Music player? Internet browser? That's what the phone is for, and as far as anyone is concerned, the iPhone currently has the fastest processor of any smartphone, at this time on the market.

Unless a Samsung somehow works without Google Plus to be able to pull up the open pages on my laptop, like Apple does, or somehow plays music better than in ear headphones already do...there's no real leg up that Samsung has.

That was a thought I pondered for a long time when I first discovered porn. I was 8 years old and I fell asleep watching a movie on CineMax at my dads house. I wake up in the middle of the night to some pretty intense softcore porn, I think it was from something called Sexcapades. Thats when I got my first boner. I liked it, it felt right. So I continued watching these late night softcore porns (not every night, I'm was never the animal I am now). Being the naturally inquisitive child I was, I started to think what would happen if the guy had to pee during sex? Would he just pee in the girl? And in what would he pee? I had not seen a vagina, it being softcore and all you don't see any gaping vaginal canals. So naturally I assumed they were doing stuff in the butt, because I don't know I was a weird little fuck. Anyway, thats how I thought babies were made for at least a year.

Perhaps one of the most interesting and colorful words in the English language today is the word "fuck".

It is a magical word which, just by its sound can describe pain, pleasure, love, and hate. In language, "fuck" falls into many grammatical categories.

It can be used as a verb both transitive (John fucked Mary) and intransitive (Mary was fucked by John).

It can be an action verb (John really gives a fuck),

a passive verb (Mary really doesn't give a fuck),

and adverb (Mary is fucking interested in John),

as every word in a sentence (fuck fucking fuckers fucked),

or as a noun (Mary is a terrific fuck).



It can also be used as an interjection (Fuck! I'm late for my date with Mary).

It can even be used as a conjunction (Mary is easy, fuck she's also stupid).


As you can see there are very few words with the overall versatility of the word fuck.

Aside from its sexual connotations, this word can be used to describe many situations:

1. Greetings........."How the fuck are ya?"

2. Fraud..............."I got fucked by the car dealer."

3. Resignation......."Oh, fuck it!"

4. Trouble............."I guess I'm fucked now."

5. Aggression........."Fuck you!"

6. Disgust................"Fuck me."

7. Confusion............." What the fuck....?"

8. Displeasure............"Fucking shit man..."

9. Lost........................"Where the fuck are we?"

10.Disbelief..............."Unfuckingbelievable!"

11.Retaliation............."Up your fucking ass!"

12. Apathy................."Who really gives a fuck?"

13. Suspicion............."Who the fuck are you?"

14. Directions.............."Fuck off."

It can be maternal........"Motherfucker!"

It can be used to tell time......."It's four fucking twenty!"

It can be used as an anatomical description............."He's a fucking asshole."

Lastly, it has been used by many notable people throughout history:

"What the fuck was that?" -Mayor of Hiroshima

"That's not a real fucking gun." -John Lennon

"Where the fuck is all this water coming from?" -Captain of the Titanic

"Who the fuck is gonna find out?" -Richard Nixon

"Heads are gonna fucking roll." -Anne Boleyn

"Any fucking idiot could answer that." -Albert Einstein

"It does so fucking look like her!" -Picasso

"You want what on the fucking ceiling?" -Michaelangelo

"Fuck a duck." -Walt Disney

"Houston, we have a big fucking problem." - The crew of Apollo 13

Are you really a virgin if you fap? Let's explore the properties of virginity to help us answer this question. Virginity is lost when you have sex with someone. It's a simple concept. But how? Let's get a logical explanation. When a man penetrates a woman, both their virginities are "taken". But where to? It's actually pretty simple. Their virginities are swapped. Since a woman's virginity can not exist properly in a man, the virginity is therefore invalid and canceled out, and the same applies to a woman taking a man's virginity. However, your hand is a part of you, and therefore does not have its own virginity. When you fap, your virginity is given to your hand, but since your hand is a part of you, your virginity is given right back to you. Even if your hand does have its own virginity, they are both the virginities of the same person, allowing this concept to still be true. This exploration into virginity concepts allows us to finally answer the question: Are you really a virgin if you fap? That answer, ladies and gentlemen, is yes.

This is an open Dab role play. I'll start.

dabs with left hand, followed by right hand. Feels strange feeling in my stomach, so I go to the doctor to check it out. Doctor informs me that I have stage 3 ass cancer from dabbing so much. I write my will, my family sets up a coffin and everything. I have 3 days to live. I decide not to go through chemotherapy, and allow myself to slip away into a comma forever. My last action, with all my left over strength, at the very seconds before I pass away into the void, I dab. One final dab to complete them all. The dab was so amazing that it resurrected me, and I was revered as Jesus Christ to Christians and Muhammed to Islam. Jews and other religions soon followed me as the messiah, and I toured the world spreading joy to the people of earth. I was after recognized as the most benevolent person to ever exist. They gave me a castle, and a large plot of land in a small European country. I decided to build a tiny army to protect my new fortress from potential invaders. Eventually all people saw that I was holy, and gave their land to me as well. After years of accumulating free land my army grew, and so did my empire. I encompassed all of Europe in the span of five years. It was now time for the final plan. Secretly, I was not the reincarnation of Jesus or Buddha or Muhammed - I was Hitler all along. I take over the world one country at a time, killing on Jews and blacks on my way in. I was so holy that no one could stop me. No one stood in my way, even those that saw first hand my true monstrosities. I had become death, the destroyer of worlds. After billions of years of immortality, I was all that there was. They called me the "dab king" and my people recognized me as a crusader throughout the universe. No evil existed, and through the perspective of my subjects, all I did was right. After an eternity there were no more individuals. The dab king was all that was left, no energy, no matter, no life, no death. All that could be seen, anywhere and everywhere in the universe, was a human male; hitting that dab, fam.

TL;DR: looking for a source on this text. Someone posted it a couple times now on different throwaway accounts. Recognize it? Maybe parts of it? General structure?

TEXT (verbatim):

>i have had this weighing me down for 16 years and finally have the courage to talk about it for the first time thanks to all of the brave women coming out with their stories.

>i nearly let this incident ruin my life. it ruined me socially for a very long time and turned me to alcohol and drugs which i still struggle with.

>my aunt took my cousin and i to see linkin park, marilyn manson and a few other bands playing a show in 2001. i was sooo excited. the only other concerts i had seen were hanson and weird al so this felt like my first real concert. i had the time of my life and was the happiest i ever was.

>we were huge fans so we tried to go out for autographs by the row of buses. chester noticed me and called me over so i grabbed my cousin's cd to get them signed and naievely ran over and had no idea what was about to happen. instead of signing my cd he told me to follow him. we went behind the bus and onto the back of a 18 wheeler and he shut the door.

>he asked if i wanted my arm signed and i said yes so he signed it. then he asked where else i wanted him to sign and i showed him my cds. he said no and asked where on my body. then he lifted my shirt and pulled my bra down and signed my breasts. i told him to stop and he asked where else i wanted him to sign. i started crying and he asked if i would sign my autograph on him. he pulled out his penis and handed me the marker. i was literally shaking because i had never even kissed a boy yet. i was only 13 and i didn't know what to do. i said no and handed him back the marker.

>he threw it and told me he was going to give me a kiss. he kissed my neck and kissed all the way down to my stomach while i was crying and he unbuttoned my jeans and pulled my panties down. he started licking me and squeezing my butt and sticking his fingers deep into my butt.

>he told me to bend over and grab a piece of metal that went down the side of the inside of the trailer and he raped me. he took my virginity as i cried and prayed. i thought i was going to die. i could hear everyone in the crowd still but it was muffled like i was wearing headphones. it felt like it was 2 hours even though im sure it was only a few minutes. there was something that looked like a seatbelt hanging from the metal thing on the trailer and i just stared at it moving praying for this to end. i was like hypnotized by this buckle. anything to try to not know what was happening

>he stopped raping me and put his penis away and just left. he left a child he had just raped alone and crying in the back of a trailer in a horrible city. i had to get off the truck and find my cousin and my aunt and pretend that nothing happened. then my cousin was mad that i lost our cds. so after all of this i had to hold everything in for the 2 hour ride home while my cousin gave me a hard time.

>i wouldn't have a boyfriend until i was 21. i wouldn't have sex until i was 26. i still can't do doggy style. then this fucking creep committed suicide and i have to read all about how sad everyone is. sad that a guy who raped a child and almost ruined her life couldn't live with the guilt anymore. how many others were there chester?

>fuck you. the tables are turned and now victims will no longer be shamed. thank you to everyone who shared their stories of abuse. this is going to haunt me forever but now it's out there and even after typing this i feel stronger.

END TEXT

To say the least, I'm skeptical. But it almost looked like a copypasta, so I figured "fuck it, I'll ask them"

hey guys, im a new furry and also an active rolling 20s crip gang member, recently my fellow gang brothers have been starting to say i've dropped the dime when they saw my gay yiff collection on my smartphone, i had to kill 2 slobs that day to convince them otherwise, they keep telling me that a real crip isn't gay and doesn't masturbate to handsome wolf boys but I think as long as I'm down for my hood it shouldnt matter what i do in my spare time, any advice for me?

This.... I am in tears. I must admit, I was, in the beginning, a denier. I thought that it would be impossible. But as the seconds counted up and as Lenin, Stalin and Trotsky continued with steely determination... I started to believe. I started to believe in something greater than vodka. Something greater than any establishment of communism before. Automatic Kalashnikov down, the most beautiful, most life changing establishment of communism in the world. I respect my comrades for their hard work and for the strides they are taking to dismantle the problematic capitalistic society we live in, to tear apart social constructs that seek to split up the classes into bourgeois and proletariat. I am so glad to see quality communism (fuck off china), LIFE CHANGING communism such as this one in history. It reminds me that there is something in this world that we should be striving for. Amongst the capitalist nations and the bear videos... This is the savior the world has been waiting for. THIS is what we need, what we deserve and what will be remembered as the greatest men made contribution in all of history. Congratulations, Comrades. You are an inspiration to all of us. You are an enlightened comrade. From the bottom of my AK’s 7.62mm round clip and, though I do speak for the workers, the hammers and sickles of many other comrades, thank you comrade.

I bet you assumed Bob Barker was dead, but you couldn't be more wrong. He is very much alive, and more active in underground scenes than ever. Bob Barker was diagnosed with small cell lymphoma in the year 1986. The government wouldn't allow Bob Barker to succumb to illness just as they were planning the early stages of Desert Storm. The country needed The Price is Right more than ever. The year 1986 also happened to be the year that Drew Carey conveniently left the Marine Corps Reserve, and moved to Los Angeles. The home of The Price is Right. As we all know Bob Barker has been encouraging Americans to spay and neuter their pets since the early 70s. Why do you think Bob Barker is so interested in animal testicles? He's been using them to stay alive. Drew Carey was secretly involved with removal, collection and processing of feline and canine testicles to sustain Bob Barker from 1986-2007. He was reassigned by the government to take over as the host of The Price is Right in 2007. For 21 years, until a suitable replacement was located, Drew Carey was the only reason Bob Barker was alive and able to prey on the cats and dogs of America. Just let that sink in.

This frog stops me from killing myself, if I never saw this frog I'd be dead. I want to be dead, I can't be saved by anyone but this frog. If I can't take life anymore I just look at this frog. He spends his life waiting for the next Wednesday, he lives for Wednesday. He lives because if he dies he'll never see Wednesday again. He waits for Wednesday.

Why does he wait for Wednesday? Does he just like saying "it is Wednesday my dudes"? Or is there more to it? 

We don't know the meaning of Wednesday to this frog, but maybe it does not matter. He waits for Wednesday.

This frog lives because of Wednesday. If he can survive 6 days of suffering for Wednesday. Maybe I can too. If I die I lose Wednesday forever. But if I live in can see many Wednesday's along with this frog. I wait for Wednesday.

All over the internet, I notice you churlish cretins lauding the supposedly intellectual television program known as Rick and Morty to make yourselves appear more intelligent by extension, as you are ardent watchers of the aforementioned show. However, you piddling planarians only succeed in illustrating how vapid you really are, as Rick and Morty has the intellectual depth of a petri dish. Truly, the most noetic show is neither Rick and Morty, the Big Bang Theory, Jimmy Neutron, nor any other deluge of drivel you deludable dimwits bombard your brains with. Rather, it is Johnny Test, a pinnacle of animation, sound design, acting, and plot. Despite this, most of you sniveling sub-10000s (someone with an IQ under 10000: for the record, my IQ is several orders of magnitude higher than this; my reason for my usage of this term is simply because I am partial to the number 10000) will dismiss Johnny Test as another subpar piece of rubbish from Teletoon, but you all fail to realize how much genius goes into producing that show. I have watched Johnny Test since I was a juvenile, and already I bear an IQ so toweringly high no known test can measure it (that is to say, no known test for humans can measure it: when using the scale with which computer processing power is evaluated, I clock in at over 8.3 trecentillion yottaflops). I have memorized every facet of human knowledge and only used 32.8% of my potential intelligence (my remaining neurons I allocate towards personal use, research, and wealthy companies for use as server farms and bitcoin mines). Not only that, but I have transformed all of the atoms in my being into a quantum computer to serve as an extension to my enormous encephalon, which handles the menial tasks and other trivialities associated with existence (such as respiration, ingestion, digestion, socializing, et cetera). Capable of perorating proficiently in every method of communication in the world, I have developed my own language that employs a manifold of grammar rules, and I created it all while thrashing a coalition of humanity’s smartest supercomputers in a game of Tic-Tac-Toe (for those who say that Tic-Tac-Toe is “easy,” think about the all the times you’ve played Tic-Tac-Toe: a majority were ties, no? Think about that, and also about the fact that a single, solitary supercomputer, much less over a dozen, is smarter than millions of you combined). And no, you cannot see me type this language because it is purely telepathic. At this point, I can imagine several of you already typing frantically in a fervent effort to keep your egos afloat in the face of such psychological grandeur. That’s right, the collective intelligence of all of you, if we’re using luminosity as an analogy, is akin to a diminutive candle in comparison to the massive quasar that represents my mind. Confronted with this, most of you will attempt to deride me with paltry, nonsensical invective and vitriolic vituperations to protect what minuscule amount of self-esteem you possess. These predictions are not the result of mere intuition, of course. In actuality, I have run several simulations using my brain alone on the possible consequences of my publication of this digital manuscription. My reply to all of you digital detractors is that if you so desire to demonstrate that you are brainier than I, then arrange for an intellectual debate between you and me on a topic of your choosing, any time or place. My schedule is very pliable as I’ve already won over 4 dozen nobel prizes, so I’m perfectly willing to put a temporary halt to my research, if you could even call it that (I speculate without demur that none of your debate skills will be enough of a problem for me to the point where I will be forced to snap out out of my subconscious simulations to employ the use of those neurons). Besides, I don’t want to be a glory hog and leave none of the secrets of the universe left for unlocking. You know, let the dogs have their day and all of that. I already know that none of you simpletons with your senescent synapses will be able to match up to my vast vernacular and verbiage, my mental dexterity with declension, and my phrenic puissance with my phraseology and pronunciation. In a matter of seconds (or possibly longer, if I’ve overestimated your already positively benthic IQs when running my simulations), you’ll fly into cantankerous conniptions after my consummate trouncing and repudiation of every single one of the “facts” that you hold so dear as proof of your purported intellect. And in response to those who claim, overcome with envy and spite, that as intelligent as I am, I will never sleep with anyone: I don’t need to. I am quite capable of simulating, to the meagerest tactile sensation, every position in the Kama Sutra (as well as a few I myself have devised for maximum oxytocin and endorphin release) simultaneously in a few seconds, and the only reason it takes even that long is because I am prolonging the simulation in order to enjoy the experience: I could do it in hundredths of a millisecond if I so wish. However, for someone with such acute acumen as I, life is far too easy. When pure ennui drives you to calculate the movements of the 27 subatomic particles you’ve discovered and how they interact with one another in the 2,038th dimension using a base 3.2407 quadrillion number system, you realize that the universe and its infinite copies and offshoots offer nothing more to you. Except, that is, for Johnny Test. Even for an individual with such altitudinous IQ such as myself, it’s difficult to understand every single subtle joke and reference. That’s not to say I don’t understand any of the plenitude of allusions, in fact, I am able to comprehend virtually every single one. For example, one minutia most of you would fail to notice is when Susan’s chin moves two extra pixels further than in any of the previous episodes when she talks during the seventeenth second of the fifth minute of season 3 episode 10. Hardly any of you would conceive of the fact that this is a reference to the exact number, down to 84 significant figures, of the percent change in total nitrogen in the Earth’s atmosphere due to the eructation of a small cynodont 257 million years ago. There are more examples I could give, such as the color of the walls of the sisters’ lab being a slightly different hue from the norm in season 4 episode 19 (a reference to the presence of approximately 2.9 millimoles of ammonium diuranate in the ink of a Chinese manuscript dated 1256 BCE), but that would detract from the intended purpose of this writing. Johnny Test is a work of art, a perfect concoction of knowledge from a multitude of academic fields that combine to make a program that is the only form of media I have ever encountered that has been even somewhat laborious for me to fathom, and I’m talking about someone who altered the biochemistry and chirality of their body in order to make it more efficient than the prodigality that is the human body. My temples ache with the pain of having to pump copious amounts of Testium (an element I discovered that takes the role of oxygen in my unique biochemistry, named after my favorite show of course) to my brain in order to comprehend what I have just watched. And to everybody who claims that the reason my temples are sore or why I have “delusions of grandeur” are due to my being “high” or whichever way you aim to construe my exegesis of an episode, you will hear vocalizations of a gelatological nature emanating from my larynx whilst Xyzyzyx the paisley pangolin (a treasured acquaintance of mine) and I reflect on your foolishness later that day.   


I await the furious fussilade of odious obluquies and belittling bombast in the comments below.

How annoying when Redditors make dumb jokes in an obvious comment chain just for the internet World Wide Web karma points. Do you really have nothing better to do than sit around on this website and make these inane little comments?

I mean, I get it.

It’s nice to sometimes just chill on a website and make a joke here and there. Clears your head of the day’s stresses.

But mans.

I see this type of crap smeared all over this website. It engorges me (with fury). It makes me big (with anger). It caresses me (with frustration). It’s a horrible experience overall.

I wish this would stop. Just **STOP!!!**

I think I’ve made my point clear.

That said, to cement the point, I shall be a teacher to you. Not out of malice, but out of love and care for you. And for humanity as a whole. Like a wise sensei, I shall grant upon all of you a downsensei in order to ensure that you learn your lesson. Such negative reinforcement shall surely encourage you to become a better person and contribute more to society and the betterment of other people’s lives.

There's literally nothing I want more in life than to marry Pitou. To be honest, my life would be complete if I could spend just one day with him. I'm hopelessly in love with him. But he's not real, so I can't. How is this fair? How is this allowed? What the fuck is wrong with this fucking world? There's not a night that goes by without me thinking about him. He's just so cute. His smile is bright like the sun and he smells like crayons and milk. Everything about him is perfect. Fuck everything. I don't know how to deal with this and I'm just about reaching my limit. I want to burn everything so I can be with him. How does /a/ deal with these kinds of feelings?

Solar eclipses are just a cover for when the 'sun'🌞 is down for maintenance.

So the Government agents known as 'Scientists'👨🏾‍🔬 tell us not to look at the Sky light🌞, but you know what they want us to look at? You guessed it; the moon🌚🌛🌝. Wake up sheep. Trust no one, question everything. #Don'tTreadOnMe

Someone could take offense." "But Mrs. Johnson," I stated "The school has memes on the school website!!!" The Bitch-looking thot then said "That's different Fred. Peepee (REEEEEEEEEEE) is a classified hate symbol by the DNC!" "You mean _LibTards_" I 🅱aid valiantly!!! The Kike gasped "FRED I WOULD NOT EXPECT THAT DISGRACEFUL BEHAVIOR FROM SOMEONE LIKE YOU!!" I then screamed "STILL DRINKING YOUR SALTY TEARS FROM NOVEMBER 6TH YOU LIBCUCK!!!!!1!! HOW FUCKING DUMB ARE YOU YOU BITCH TRUMP WILL LEAD US TO GLOBAL DOMINATIOOOOOOOOONN!"

I hate to break it to you man, but I know for a fact that Bruce Wayne is definitely Batman. Well, not literally. Batman is just his lackey, but Wayne has to be the one pulling the strings.

Who else in Gotham has the money and lack of respect for our police services to fund Batman? Wayne created Batman (okay, I'm pretty sure I can prove it's actually BatMEN but that's a discussion for another day) and his so-called rogues gallery to sow chaos for political gain. While politicians are so busy discussing what to do with the literal vigilante war happening in our streets, Wayne's company is totally beyond investigation for its crimes against humanity! I read a reliable article about how Wayne enterprises cured cancer but is withholding it to profit from the price of treatment.

Wake up sheeple! Open your eyes to the truth!

Give me one good reason to believe Delaware exists. Think about it. Have you ever been to Delaware? And if you think you did go yourself, are you sure that those "Welcome to Delaware" signs actually mean anything? And if people have told you about their trips there, do you really trust those people? You cannot honestly answer yes to any of these questions. Sure, it's on all the US maps, and it has a website, but these things could be easily faked. If you try to recall where it is, your mind will be hazy. I mean, it's somewhere north right? This is evidence of Big States's master plan. You see, Delaware is where Big States operates. It is where they work to propagandize other fake states, like Wyoming, Alaska, and Oklahoma. They also plan covert operations to "disappear" truth tellers like me. But why? do you ask. Why would the government fake all these states? That's what I'm trying to figure out myse-NO! NO!

God, the cringe...where do I even start?
First and foremost, if you think this is the only show that's ever shown any level of quiet intellectualism buried in a simpler comedic guise, you REALLY need to get out more. It's a common theme amongst writers in a LOT of shows.
Second, comedy is an art, and art is SUBJECTIVE. Not everyone is going to like the same jokes, regardless of intellect. To say that everyone that disagrees with your OPINION is stupid only shows how lacking you really are in your own intelligence.
Third, you really DON'T need to "have a very high lQ" to enjoy this show. Some education may help get references, but it's really not required to enjoy the show. Again, pretty common theme amongst a lot of writers.
Finally, if you think you can impress 'the ladies' with a tattoo of a cartoon and an over inflated ego based on our sad and clear misunderstanding of your lQ, you're really setting yourself up for failure. Which, again, only further illustrates a deep lack of the intellect you seem to believe you Lord over the world.
In short, there's nothing more dangerous than an idiot that believes he's smart. So please be less of a danger to those around you.

Can we be real for a second? How did Anakin have a Force ghost at the end of Episode 6? Didn't Yoda have to meditate intensely on the Light Side to achieve becoming a Force ghost? In the Clone Wars TV show,  it is explained that becoming a Force ghost is something that Yoda invented and taught Obi-Wan.

It seems we have come to an impass. This means war! My fleets shall wipe your worlds sterile! Even the littlest of ants shall not avoid my wrath. The gods will look down upon the stars and watch as one by one the life force of your worlds is snuffed out by my backlash to your transgression. Your women will weep and your children will flee at the mere mention of my name. You will wish that you never evolved past monkeys. I will drive you back to the oceans and then I will boil them away. I shall vaporize your worlds so quickly, there won’t even be a chance for your civilization to burn. I will order my men to send the ashes of your destroyed cities into the nearest stars so that not even your existence will be known to future historians. I will erase your very name from all history past, present, and future. It will be a capital punishment just to utter the name. This is what you have brought upon yourself. Your gods have abandoned you and left me, the god of your death, in their absence. And there is no need for you in my universe. Faggot

I fucking hate bad content. I only like quality good original content, for example howtobasic. That’s some quality stuff right there. Also, can you follow my meme account? It’s got like 12 followers and I’m trying to get shouted out by bigger meme pages so that I’m in the meme community. Maybe we can even DOX some kids, like keemstar he accused an old man of rape and he said the n word. How fucked up is that? Also 9/11 was funny and I’m hitler LMAO pewdiepie didn’t do anything wrong it’s freedom of speech you fuck. I fucking hate keemstar lmfao. I hate normies who use slang, they sound so retarded with their “LMFAOOO IM DEAD” lmao. Also, if you’re up for it, let’s raid some kids. Btw, if you don’t like idubbbz or something you’re fucking delusional. He’s deadass the smartest guy out there AND he makes quality content. Have you seen that new Asian jake paul content cop he made? Lmao that left me dead. Especially the diss track, it was low key fire. Fuck all those normies and their clout. I loved when they emo british guy started rambling because he made a rap about why you shouldn’t stay in school and I could relate to it. Do you watch h3h3? I fucking LOVE him he’s so funny and his double chin and his red beanie. Oh yeah and pewdiepie is so fucking funny so if you don’t watch that shit you’re just a fucking normie who’s probably a cuck, you fucking snowflake motherfucker, go back to watching the loony toons or some shit while I’ll go watch some quality content like idubbbz and Ricky and mortey. Cunt.

They just HAD to do it, didn't they? I'm GENUINELY at a loss right now. It's the only place where I felt at home, where I get to enjoy the company of people like ME, where I get to sympathize with individuals who's in the same predicament as I am. Again and again we are set aside by the majority, by the 'normal', by the 'standard'. Why do most of you feel the need to crush us. We are already broken as it is, and you still desire to crush us further by banning our sub? You are probably thinking right now, 'who cares about how this misogynistic sociopath feels, better root them out now before they turn into rapists and murdurers.' You misunderstand, Outside we don't act like how we post in r/incels. It is our only means of releasing this pent up and clovered mess of emotions inside us. But now, our mouths are shut. What am I supposed to do with these emotions now? 'Seek mental health, go to X, go to Y.' Tell you what, time and time again, everything I've said falls into deaf ears, I've been into one for 5 years now and it does jack shit. 'mhmmm such a shame, take these medications' 'mhmmm have you tried sharing your shit hobbies to others? now come back next week'. FUCKING nignogs. They're only sucking my finances dry for fuck's sake, they're only there because it's their job, because it gets them money. r/incels on the other hand truly understood my problem because they have my problem. I am GENUINELY and UNIRONICALLY shedding a tear right now.

Im saying mario is weeby, but you can be a mario weeb. having princess p body pillows and collecting every toy and makig them sticky with cum with a fat plush realistic mario doll and stroking and carressing his thick, bushy mustache whilst telling him "can you fix my pipe, plumber? Its a little bent." And then re enacting a mario and peach porno with the two dolls. Sometimes I fall into his trap, those huuuge eyes, they hypnotise me and tell me "my dicks big." I do however, somehow manage to break free and say "NO THATS FUCKING GAY YOU ITALIAN PEDO FUCK IM 14 I DONT WANT THAT SPAGHETTI COCK UP MY ASS HOLE". But one time, he almost got me. He spawned a pipe beneath my feet and suddenly i was transported under ground. There was bass -ey music playing,but i couldnt tell where it was coming from. All I saw was a dark, cave and the stone was blue for some reason. I then heard the iconic "Letsa gooo!" In his faggot voice. He appeared naked. He had countless rolls of flabs, which had grease oozing out from between them. He had fat burger nips and a HUGE oily cock which was fully erect. I gulped and his cock responded with a jolt upwards and then going back to its normal position, as if it were nodding. Luckily, he transported me as I was getting ready to shoot up my nursery because this one slag, mrs patel shoved my face in the sand. I still had 3 glocks hidden up my ass and i pulled them out. I swiftly and accurately shot his cock, making him unable to shove it inside anyone. I then took a shot at his chest, but i got the bullet stuck between his flabs. I said "ill shoot your cock again unless you get me back to the nursery". He said "A mama mia ill get you-a back to tha nursary just dont shoot my dick". 

And thats how i survived. Be careful mario weebs, he will come for you.

Also i have a big dick.

To be fair, you have to have a very high IQ to understand Bioshock Infinite. The storyline is extremely complex, and without a solid grasp of quantum physics, most of the meaning will go over a typical viewer’s head. There’s also Booker's penitent outlook, which is deftly woven into his characterization- his personal philosophy draws heavily from late-1800s native american war literature, for instance. The fans understand this stuff; they have the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate the depths of the storyline, to realise that it's not just sophisticated- it says something deep about LIFE. As a consequence, people who dislike Bioshock Infinite truly ARE idiots- of course they wouldn’t appreciate, for instance, the meaning in Elizabeth's existential catchphrase “Time rots everything. Even hope.,” which itself is a reference to John von Neumann's 'Mathematical Foundations of Quantum Mechanics'. I’m smirking right now just imagining one of those addlepated simpletons scratching their heads in confusion as Ken Levine's genius wit unfolds itself on their their gaming screens. What fools.. how I pity them. 😂

And yes, by the way, i DO have a Songbird tattoo. And no, you cannot see it. It’s for the ladies’ eyes only- and even then they have to demonstrate that they’re within 5 IQ points of my own (preferably lower) beforehand. Nothin personnel kid 😎

You have to have a very high IQ to understand Pink Floyd. The musical themes are extremely subtle, and without a solid grasp of theoretical physics most of the themes will go over a typical listener’s head. There’s also Roger’s nihilistic outlook, which is deftly woven into his singing- his personal philosophy draws heavily from Narodnaya Volya literature, for instance. The fans understand this stuff; they have the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate the depths of these songs, to realise that they’re not just genius- they say something deep about LIFE. As a consequence people who dislike Pink Floyd truly ARE idiots- of course they wouldn’t appreciate, for instance, the lyrics in David’s lyrics in “Comfortably Numb,” which itself is a cryptic reference to Turgenev’s Russian epic Fathers and Sons. I’m smirking right now just imagining one of those addlepated simpletons scratching their heads in confusion as Roger Water’s genius wit unfolds itself through their record players. What fools.. how I pity them. 😂 And yes, by the way, i DO have a Pink Floyd Dark Side Of The Moon tattoo. And no, you cannot see it. It’s for the ladies’ eyes only- and even then they have to demonstrate that they’re within 5 IQ points of my own (preferably lower) beforehand. Nothin personnel kid 😎

 I am a confusing. I wear a hoodie, a backwards hat, mascara, and I have short hair. I’m not lesbian. I’m not trans. I’m not bi. I just have a problem with females and disassociate myself from their basic bitch ways. 

Oh!! You think I look like a boy?? It’s better than looking like a bitch. 
I hate girls. 
Not all girls
But 95% of girls nowadays 
Unloyal, mean, untrustworthy snakes. 

Constantly rolling their eyes and rolling their tounges out to take a selfie.I actually support LGBT in every way possible. But I’m not LGBT. I act like a boy I laugh at boy things… I grew up with boys….. 
I don’t know what my problem is…. I’m fine with the girls here but as soon as you start taking pictures of yourself with your tits busting out of your shirt I’m done.

I have been studying console vs pc for Overwatch and I have found out that in most cases pc is better for several reason. One reason why is because of the controller limitations. Controllers have limited range of motion because of "Dead Zones" which are the spot to where the thumbstick doesn't actually trigger any actions. One Dead Zone are (in most modern thumbsticks)  is the center. Think about this, if you don't touch the thumbsticks then they are in the center and nothing will trigger until you start moving them. Another Issue is that you have borders around the thumbstick usually where the plastic meets. On a mouse you don't really have borders, besides the edge of your desk. In the case of Overwatch, it is hard to be precise even with the help of aim assist. Playing certain characters that focus on quick reaction can be frustrating. If you want to play competitive (I personally don’t recommend it unless you have time) is better on PC because if your good enough you can get into the “Overwatch League” which is a professional league of Overwatch players that participate in tournaments. On console there is no professional league for Overwatch. The pc community for Overwatch is better and over 70% of all Overwatch players play on pc. The bottom line is Overwatch is way better on pc!

If you really think about it, memers and redditors have no real life goals. They’re wasting their precious time and life on something that isn’t advancing human development or bettering the society. What’s even worse than these scumbags are the people who waste hours looking for memes just to repost them and gather likes. The amount of time you devote to memes is equal to the amount of time one spends to get a Phd in school. Stop getting sucked into this blasphemous way of life and start devoting more time on watching Death Note, cause we all know it’s the best anime to ever exist. Also did I mention Death Note is infinite times better than code gayass?

Wow. Just wow, really. I mean is this how girls and guys actually talk in private? It's astonishing in how absolutely dull, vapid and inconsequential it is. Are you trying to penetrate this girl? Are you trying to date her? If not why are you sitting there posting emojis and admitting your stupidity and tacitly encouraging her to continue her superficial analysis of "Asian" philosophy. Who even calls it "Asian" philosophy? It's Eastern, for goodness sake. I can only imagine Schopenhauer finding a phone in his class after giving a lecture and reading through texts like this and rubbing his forehead in utter dismay. Personally as someone who has utterly transcended the need and pretty much even the desire to sniff pussy stink and jam my penis inside a girl a bunch of times I am embarrassed for you both and thankful that I simply don't care about girls enough to debase myself the way you're doing here. Trust me, I can just tell that this is the kind of girl that I could have crushing on me like some Klebold fangirl within several minutes of discussion, if this the kind of thing she's interested in. But this is really eye-opening stuff OP. Makes me want to kill myself immediately.

Key words (Philosophy, author's name) can be altered, but this definitely has potential as a reply to text convos between a guy and a girl.

First they took Scrubs off the air, and I did not speak out, because 30 Rock was still on. Then they took 30 Rock, and I did not speak out, because It's Always Sunny was still on... but now they're taking It's Always Sunny. Great shows are dropping one by one, and who knows what show might be next? Well, let me tell you something. Something from the heart: You can't take The Office off Netflix. It's not fair. It would take a SWAT team to get us to stop streaming Office episodes, and maybe not even then. It wouldn't be fair to this sub or other Office fans who haven't found this sub yet. We need The Office. My Netflix subscription is literally ten(s) of dollars a month, and I have no savings whatsoever.
If I could leave you with one thought: It's Always Sunny deserves to stay on the air, and they are trying to make it an escape goat. If The Office gets taken down, I swear to God, every review page on Netflix will have the "F" word on it. The "F" word.

Did you ever hear the tradegy of B Emoji The Wise? I thought not. It's not a story the Mods would tell you. It's a Reddit legend. B Emoji was the Dank Lord of the Memes, so dank and so fresh he could use the titles to influence the upvotes to create Reddit Gold. He had such a knowledge of memetics that he could even keep the memes he cared about from dying. The dank side of the Memes is a pathway to many formats some consider to be unnatural. He became so popular... the only thing he was afraid of was over-exposure, which eventually, of course, he got. Unfortunately, he taught sloth_on_meth everything he knew, then the mods banned him in his sleep. Ironic. He could save other memes from death, but not himself.

I just fucking love Rick and Morty, in the way that I fucking love science. It's so random and cool - it's like the show was designed for us Redditors, see? My mom says I have an unhealthy obsession with the show, but she just doesn't understand how funny it. I wish I could live in the Rick and Morty world and be their friends. Everything would be really and cool and funny if I did. Rick and Morty are so funny and I'm so awesome that it would make perfect sense, but it'd be even better if Bernie Sanders appeared. It'd be so awesome I'd turn up the TV in the common room of my dorm up all the way so everyone could hear the greatness of Bernie Sanders, Ron Paul, bacon, weed, atheism, The Avengers, Guardians of the Galaxy, Sweden, Bill Nye, 90s cartoons, cats, and fucking loving science.

I run the Rick and Morty Club at my school - we come together, browse Reddit, make some Deadpool memes and watch Rick and Morty. We don't talk to each other but there's a cute girl there I'm gonna try and ask out. I'm a nice guy and I dress well (fedora + trench coat + brown-stained underwear + well-trimmed beard lightly seasoned with dust and corn syrup) so I just know I've got a good chance with her. I've already messaged her on Facebook, I just haven't got a response yet.

Anyway, back to the topic at hand: Rick and Morty! My favorite character is Rick because his style of humor perfectly reflects that of Reddit. I bet if I asked him "When does the narwhal bacon?", he'd know EXACTLY what I was talking about. Also, did you notice he looks like Bernie Sanders if you squint a bit and use your imagination? This can't be a coincidence; MLG Illuminati confirmed. Yeah, that's right, I look at montage parodies too. What good Redditor doesn't? Lenny face, Illuminati, and Doge are so funny. If I met Rick and Morty I'd be sure to show them all those funny and awesome memes and more!

Yours baconly, Atheist92

ARTICLE 8.

The Members of the League recognise that the maintenance of peace requires the reduction of national armaments to the lowest point consistent with national safety and the enforcement by common action of international obligations. The Council, taking account of the geographical situation and circumstances of each State, shall formulate plans for such reduction for the consideration and action of the several Governments. Such plans shall be subject to reconsideration and revision at least every ten years. After these plans shall have been adopted by the several Governments, the limits of armaments therein fixed shall not be exceeded without the concurrence of the Council. The Members of the League agree that the manufacture by private enterprise of munitions and implements of war is open to grave objections. The Council shall advise how the evil effects attendant upon such manufacture can be prevented, due regard being had to the necessities of those Members of the League which are not able to manufacture the munitions and implements of war necessary for their safety. The Members of the League undertake to interchange full and frank information as to the scale of their armaments, their military, naval, and air programmes and the condition of such of their industries as are adaptable to war-like purposes.

ARTICLE 9.

A permanent Commission shall be constituted to advise the Council on the execution of the provisions of Articles 1 and 8 and on military, naval, and air questions generally.

ARTICLE 10.

The Members of the League undertake to respect and preserve as against external aggression the territorial integrity and existing political independence of all Members of the League. In case of any such aggression or in case of any threat or danger of such aggression the Council shall advise upon the means by which this obligation shall be fulfilled.

ARTICLE 11.

Any war or threat of war, whether immediately affecting any of the Members of the League or not, is hereby declared a matter of concern to the whole League, and the League shall take any action that may be deemed wise and effectual to safeguard the peace of nations. In case any such emergency should arise the Secretary General shall on the request of any Member of the League forthwith summon a meeting of the Council. It is also declared to be the friendly right of each Member of the League to bring to the attention of the Assembly or of the Council any circumstance whatever affecting international relations which threatens to disturb international peace or the good understanding between nations upon which peace depends.

ARTICLE 12.

The Members of the League agree that if there should arise between them any dispute likely to lead to a rupture, they will submit the matter either to arbitration or to inquiry by the Council, and they agree in no case to resort to war until three months after the award by the arbitrators or the report by the Council. In any case under this Article the award of the arbitrators shall be made within a reasonable time, and the report of the Council shall be made within six months after the submission of the dispute.

ARTICLE 13.

The Members of the League agree that whenever any dispute shall arise between them which they recognise to be suitable for submission to arbitration and which cannot be satisfactorily settled by diplomacy, they will submit the whole subject-matter to arbitration. Disputes as to the interpretation of a treaty, as to any question of international law, as to the existence of any fact which if established would constitute a breach of any international obligation, or as to the extent and nature of the reparation to be made or any such breach, are declared to be among those which are generally suitable for submission to arbitration. For the consideration of any such dispute the court of arbitration to which the case is referred shall be the Court agreed on by the parties to the dispute or stipulated in any convention existing between them. The Members of the League agree that they will carry out in full good faith any award that may be rendered, and that they will not resort to war against a Member of the League which complies therewith. In the event of any failure to carry out such an award, the Council shall propose what steps should be taken to give effect thereto.

ARTICLE 14.

The Council shall formulate and submit to the Members of the League for adoption plans for the establishment of a Permanent Court of International Justice. The Court shall be competent to hear and determine any dispute of an international character which the parties thereto submit to it. The Court may also give an advisory opinion upon any dispute or question referred to it by the Council or by the Assembly.

ARTICLE 15.

If there should arise between Members of the League any dispute likely to lead to a rupture, which is not submitted to arbitration in accordance with Article 13, the Members of the League agree that they will submit the matter to the Council. Any party to the dispute may effect such submission by giving notice of the existence of the dispute to the Secretary General, who will make all necessary arrangements for a full investigation and conside ation thereof. For this purpose the parties to the dispute will communicate to the Secretary General, as promptly as possible, statements of their case with all the relevant facts and papers, and the Council may forthwith direct the publication thereof. The Council shall endeavour to effect a settlement of the dispute, and if such efforts are successful, a statement shall be made public giving such facts and explanations regarding the dispute and the terms of settlement thereof as the Council may deem appropriate. If the dispute is not thus settled, the Council either unanimously or by a majority vote shall make and publish a report containing a statement of the facts of the dispute and the recommendations which are deemed just and proper in regard thereto Any Member of the League represented on the Council may make public a statement of the facts of the dispute and of its conclusions regarding the same. If a report by the Council is unanimously agreed to by the members thereof other than the Representatives of one or more of the parties to the dispute, the Members of the League agree that they will not go to war with any party to the dispute which complies with the recommendations of the report. If the Council fails to reach a report which is unanimously agreed to by the members thereof, other than the Representatives of one or more of the parties to the dispute, the Members of the League reserve to themselves the right to take such action as they shall consider necessary for the maintenance of right and justice. If the dispute between the parties is claimed by one of them, and is found by the Council, to arise out of a matter which by international law is solely within the domestic jurisdiction of that party, the Council shall so report, and shall make no recommendation as to its settlement. The Council may in any case under this Article refer the dispute to the Assembly. The dispute shall be so referred at the request of either party to the dispute, provided that such request be made within fourteen days after the submission of the dispute to the Council. In any case referred to the Assembly, all the provisions of this Article and of Article 12 relating to the action and powers of the Council shall apply to the action and powers of the Assembly, provided that a report made by the Assembly, if concurred in by the Representatives of those Members of the League represented on the Council and of a majority of the other Members of the League, exclusive in each case of the Rpresentatives of the parties to the dispute shall have the same force as a report by the Council concurred in by all the members thereof other than the Representatives of one or more of the parties to the dispute.

ARTICLE 16.

Should any Member of the League resort to war in disregard of its covenants under Articles 12, 13, or 15, it shall ipso facto be deemed to have committed an act of war against all other Members of the League, which hereby undertake immediately to subject it to the severance of all trade or financial relations, the prohibition of all intercourse between their nations and the nationals of the covenant-breaking State, and the prevention of all financial, commercial, or personal intercourse between the nationals of the covenant-breaking State and the nationals of any other State, whether a Member of the League or not. It shall be the duty of the Council in such case to recommend to the several Governments concerned what effective military, naval, or air force the Members of the League shall severally contribute to the armed forces to be used to protect the covenants of the League. The Members of the League agree, further, that they will mutually support one another in the financial and economic measures which are taken under this Article, in order to minimise the loss and inconvenience resulting from the above measures, and that they will mutually support one another in resisting any special measures aimed at one of their number by the covenant-breaking State, and that they will take the necessary steps to afford passage through their territory to the forces of any of the Members of the League which are co-operating to protect the covenants of the League. Any Member of the League which has violated any covenant of the League may be declared to be no longer a Member of the League by a vote of the Council concurred in by the Representatives of all the other Members of the League represented thereon.

ARTICLE 17.

In the event of a dispute between a Member of the League and a State which is not a Member of the League, or between States not Members of the League, the State or States, not Members of the League shall be invited to accept the obligations of membership in the League for the purposes of such dispute, upon such conditions as the Council may deem just. If such invitation is accepted, the provisions of Articles 12 to 16 inclusive shall be applied with such modifications as may be deemed necessary by the Council. Upon such invitation being given the Council shall immediately institute an inquiry into the circumstances of the dispute and recommend such action as may seem best and most effectual in the circumstances.If a State so invited shall refuse to accept the obligations of membership in the League for the purposes of such dispute, and shall resort to war against a Member of the League, the provisions of Article 16 shall be applicable as against the State taking such action. If both parties to the dispute when so invited refuse to accept the obligations of membership in the League for the purpose of such dispute, the Council may take such measures and make such recommendations as will prevent hostilities and will result in the settlement of the dispute.

ARTICLE 18.

Every treaty or international engagement entered into hereafter by any Member of the League shall be forthwith registered with the Secretariat and shall as soon as possible be published by it. No such treaty or international engagement shall be binding until so registered.

ARTICLE 19.

The Assembly may from time to time advise the reconsideration by Members of the League of treaties which have become inapplicable and the consideration of international conditions whose continuance might endanger the peace of the world.

ARTICLE 20.

The Members of the League severally agree that this Covenant is accepted as abrogating all obligations or understandings inter se which are inconsistent with the terms thereof, and solemnly undertake that they will not hereafter enter into any engagements inconsistent with the terms thereof. In case any Member of the League shall, before becoming a Member of the League, have undertaken any obligations inconsistent with the terms of this Covenant, it shall be the duty of such Member to take immediate steps to procure its release from such obligations.

ARTICLE 21.

Nothing in this Covenant shall be deemed to affect the validity of international engagements, such as treaties of arbitration or regional understandings like the Monroe doctrine, for securing the maintenance of peace.

ARTICLE 22.

To those colonies and territories which as a consequence of the late war have ceased to be under the sovereignty of the States which formerly governed them and which are inhabited by peoples not yet able to stand by themselves under the strenuous conditions of the modern world, there should be applied the principle that the well-being and development of such peoples form a sacred trust of civilisation and that securities for the performance of this trust should be embodied in this Covenant. The best method of giving practical effect to this principle is that the tutelage of such peoples should be entrusted to advanced nations who by reason of their resources, their experience or their geographical position can best undertake this responsibility, and who are willing to accept it, and that this tutelage should be exercised by them as Mandatories on behalf of the League. The character of the mandate must differ according to the stage of the development of the people, the geographical situation of the territory, its economic conditions, and other similar circumstances. Certain communities formerly belonging to the Turkish Empire have reached a stage of development where their existence as independent nations can be provisionally recognised subject to the rendering of administrative advice and assistance by a Mandatory until such time as they are able to stand alone. The wishes of these communities must be a principal consideration in the selection of the Mandatory. Other peoples, especially those of Central Africa, are at such a stage that the Mandatory must be responsible for the administration of the territory under conditions which will guarantee freedom of conscience and religion, subject only to the maintenance of public order and morals, the prohibition of abuses such as the slave trade, the arms traffic, and the liquor traffic, and the prevention of the establishment of fortifications or military and naval bases and of military training of the natives for other than police purposes and the defence of territory, and will also secure equal opportunities for the trade and commerce of other Members of the League. There are territories, such as South-West Africa and certain of the South Pacific Islands, which, owing to the sparseness of their population, or their small size, or their remoteness from the centres of civilisation, or their geographical contiguity to the territory of the Mandatory, and other circumstances, can be best administered under the laws of the Mandatory as integral portions of its territory, subject to the safeguards above mentioned in the interests of the indigenous population. In every case of mandate, the Mandatory shall render to the Council an annual report in reference to the territory committed to its charge. The degree of authority, control, or administration to be exercised by the Mandatory shall, if not previously agreed upon by the Members of the League, be explicitly defined in each case by the Council. A permanent Commission shall be constituted to receive and examine the annual reports of the Mandatories and to advise the Council on all matters relating to the observance of the mandates.

ARTICLE 23.

Subject to and in accordance with the provisions of international conventions existing or hereafter to be agreed upon, the Members of the League:

will endeavour to secure and maintain fair and humane conditions of labour for men, women, and children, both in their own countries and in all countries to which their commercial and industrial relations extend, and for that purpose will establish and maintain the necessary international organisations;
undertake to secure just treatment of the native inhabitants of territories under their control;
will entrust the League with the general supervision over the execution of agreements with regard to the traffic in women and children, and the traffic in opium and other dangerous drugs;
will entrust the League with the general supervision of the trade in arms and ammunition with the countries in which the control of this traffic is necessary in the common interest;
will make provision to secure and maintain freedom of communications and of transit and equitable treatment for the commerce of all Members of the League. In this connection, the special necessities of the regions devastated during the war of 1914-1918 shall be borne in mind;
will endeavour to take steps in matters of international concern for the prevention and control of disease.
ARTICLE 24.

There shall be placed under the direction of the League all international bureaux already established by general treaties if the parties to such treaties consent. All such international bureaux and all commissions for the regulation of matters of international interest hereafter constituted shall be placed under the direction of the League. In all matters of international interest which are regulated by general conventions but which are not placed under the control of international bureaux or commissions, the Secretariat of the League shall, subject to the consent of the Council and if desired by the parties, collect and distribute all relevant information and shall render any other assistance which may be necessary or desirable. The Council may include as part of the expenses of the Secretariat the expenses of any bureau or commission which is placed under the direction of the League.

ARTICLE 25.

The Members of the League agree to encourage and promote the establishment and co-operation of duly authorised voluntary national Red Cross organisations having as purposes the improvement of health, the prevention of disease, and the mitigation of suffering throughout the world.

ARTICLE 26.

Amendments to this Covenant will take effect when ratified by the Members of the League whose representatives compose the Council and by a majority of the Members of the League whose Representatives compose the Assembly. No such amendment shall bind any Member of the League which signifies its dissent therefrom, but in that case it shall cease to be a Member of the League.

When r/the_donald sends its people, they're not sending their best... They're sending people that have lots of problems, and they're bringing those problems with us. They're bringing fake news. They're bringing disinformation. They're racists. And some, I assume, are good people.

But I speak to mods and they tell us what we’re getting. And it only makes common sense. It only makes common sense. They’re sending us not the right people.

This.... I am in tears. I must admit, I was, in the beginning, a denier. I thought that it would be impossible. But as the seconds counted up and as Jack continued with steely determination... I started to believe. I started to believe in something greater than myself. Something greater than any dab before.
Hands down, the most beautiful, most life changing video on this platform. I commend Jack for his hard work and for the strides he is taking to dismantle the problematic society we live in, to tear apart social constructs that seek to divide and weaken the solidarity of community. I am so glad to see quality content, LIFE CHANGING content such as this video on the trending page. It reminds me that there is something in this world that we should be striving for. Amongst the fake news and the cat videos... This is the savior the internet has been waiting for. THIS is what we need, what we deserve and what will be remembered as the greatest man made contribution in all of history. 
Congratulations, Jack. You are an inspiration to all of us. You are an enlightened being. From the bottom of my heart and, though I do not speak for the masses, the hearts of many other people, thank you.

Uhm, ok. What was the point of this comment exactly? I mean, I get it. You like his comment and agree. You realized something incredible! Mindblowing. And you want to express that. I've had those times as well... let's face it, it's a normal form of communication. But, your inane comment simply adds nothing of value to the conversation. What does agreeing with him do? Does it make you feel old to be part of the team? Does it make you happy to say that you're following his thought patterns? Is this really what you want out of Life?

I think you can do better, son. That's why I'm going to use the parental approach, and give you a downvote. Not because I dislike you. But because I want to teach you this very valuable lesson. Contribute to conversation - to society, my friend. Don't be a follower, be a leader. Even if it means you get downteachered as I'm fairly certain I will (but I'm brave and wise enough to comprehend the ill and negligible value of internet points, so that's irrelevant).

May the force be with you, and live stronk and Casper, OP Juan Canopy.

I'll never understand why shows aimed at straight males have male nudity. We had three girls technically naked in this episode and still got no female nudity, but one male is naked and of course we see his ass. I'm not gay so I'm dropping this. This is the third season in a row my most anticipated anime ended up getting a 1/10 from me. It's been a horrible year.

If you think it hasn't been a horrible year thats fine, but that doesn't change the fact that I think it has been. They've teased showing female ass several times and not done it, but they've shown a male ass. I don't want to see naked males, I'm not going to watch a show that shows naked males but doesn't show naked females. A 1/10 on MAL stands for "appalling" and I was appalled by what I saw. And yes naked male ass is 1/10 worthy considering I'm a straight male and the show is so far refusing to show female ass.

Scots. Why you gotta talk so much about Scotland? Literally no one cares about your ridiculous country so why do you have to talk so much about how special it is and how much better it is than England. The rest of us can't relate when you go on (with only other Scots) about "haggis" and "Daddy Salmond" and how to pronounce "Edinburgh." The only national identity you've salvaged over the last 1500 years is a fucking mediocre AMERICAN-OWNED golf chain. You're embarassing yourselves. Also, you're not much better than the English. Your accents are literally the exact same so stop trying to pretend they're not. Plus, I have met so many asshole Scots so stop trying to tell me that all Scots are friendly little liberals. Drumchapel is a thing, the entire non-obese population was completely wiped out before 2009, William Wallace owned slaves, Tony Blair was re-elected, mommy Sturgeon still hasn't tackled independence which she promised in her campaign. Face it. Berwick-upon-Tweed is the best part of your country and it fucking hates you. Edinburgh would be kind-of-nice if people who aren't in the upper 1% could afford to live there! Glasgow is hideous. Dundee is a natural disaster. The Highlands are so fucking boring and poor. What the fuck even are the islands?!! Take the hint you national identity-less fucks.

Did you ever hear the tradegy of B Emoji The Wise? I thought not. It's not a story the Mods would tell you. It's a Reddit legend. B Emoji was the Dank Lord of the Memes, so dank and so fresh he could use the titles to influence the upvotes to create Reddit Gold. He had such a knowledge of memetics that he could even keep the memes he cared about from dying. The dank side of the Memes is a pathway to many formats some consider to be unnatural. He became so popular... the only thing he was afraid of was over-exposure, which eventually, of course, he got. Unfortunately, he taught sloth_on_meth everything he knew, then the mods banned him in his sleep. Ironic. He could save other memes from death, but not himself.

Greetings fellow alphas. I've been practicing TRP for like, almost two whole weeks now, so I'm what you all might consider an expert in the art of “sexual strategy”. I took the time to write this field report between my deluge of sexual escapades to give all you budding new alphas something to aspire to.

READ EVERY LAST DETAIL CAREFULLY. And learn. This is all 100% accurate. Everything in this story literally happened.

It's Saturday night, 9 PM. Dressed in my cargo shorts, best fedora, and black button down shirt with a swirly dragon on the back, I casually made my way into the local night club with my alpha swag turned up to 11.

As I'm scanning the environment for a potential sex-thing, I head over to the bar and order a drink, not forgetting to tip my fedora to the bartender with a slight smirk. I sip on my drink for a bit and continue to scan the room for bitches that fit my lofty criteria, knowing that a true alpha such as myself never settles for anything less than swim suit models from the cover of Sports Illustrated. After a few more minutes of hunting for prey, my eyes shot across the bar and made eye contact with some HB10 who was literally Heidi Klum. “She's alright,” I think to myself. Not wanting to lose my frame, I stared that whore straight in the eyes while thinking about how hypergamous and slutty all women are. It was like I was pummeling her feeble female brain with my alpha psywaves, and the look in her eyes told me that her panties were already turning into an ocean of pure, unadulterated sexual arousal; my alpha frequencies were taking over every station, and her brain was tuning in like a goddamn ham radio. She smiled at me, but I knew that bitches immediately lose interest as soon as you express any kind of humanity whatsoever, so I just stared back at her with my mighty alpha gaze.

“I have this hypergamous slut the palm of my hand,” I think to myself, “I guess she'll do.”

I strolled over to the bitch and her group of friends. I could sense that she actually had some degree of confidence, so she clearly needed to be negged into next week. As I confidently made my way up to her group, I looked her straight in the eyes and nonchalantly told her that she might actually be attractive if she lost like 50 pounds. The whole bar immediately went silent in disbelief at the size of my cajones.

After the initial shock wore off, every girl in the surrounding area immediately noticed my uber-alpha status, and I could see the little hamsters running in their head as they all figured out the best way to climb aboard my alpha cock and spermjack me. I ignored there silent pleas to be plowed though, and maintained focus on the bitch I came over for. After a few seconds, she jumped out of her seat and instantly started making out with me in the middle of the bar. She offers to let me bang her right here on the table in front of everybody, but since I'm already on the sex offender list, I tell her to find some place a bit more private.

She dragged me to the bathrooms at the back. We enter the woman's bathroom and go to the stall at the far end, and she proceeded to tell me about the secret room in the back of all female bathrooms that women use to secretly ride the cock-carousel so that their beta providers never find out. It's a sacred place, installed in literally every female bathroom since it was decreed in the first era of the feminazi regime, and collectively referred to as “Narnia”. Though this place is known to all women, only the few TRUE alpha males know of its existence. I laughed and called her a dumb whore, because of course I already know about Narnia (from like, Roosh's blog or something), and my continued negging only made this bitch more moist and wanting. She pulls down a tiny lever behind the little tampon-disposal thingy on the side of the stall, and the wall behind the toilet opens to reveal a winding staircase.

As we made our way to the bottom, she tells me that she's a virgin and a devout Christian who told her beta boyfriend that she was saving herself for marriage, but had instantly changed her mind after her primal instincts were wooed by my alpha frame. She also literally just turned 18 like five minutes ago, and so did eight of her similarly virgin-Christian friends who were waiting at the bottom of the stairs to join in. Normally I'd be offended that a bitch would just decide to invite eight of her friends to our sexual romp without consulting me first, because bitches aren't allowed to make decisions. I happened to be in a forgiving mood today, however, so I figured I'd let it slide this time.

We get down to the bottom, and we're instantly greeted by her flock of whores who had been eagerly waiting at the foot of the stairs to cheat on their beta boyfriends. I inspect each of them closely to ensure that they're all up to my supreme standards and that none of them would lower my SMV. Most of them were hot enough to fuck I guess, until I got to the last one; a short haired, horse-owning feminist with a degree in women's studies and a t-shirt that said “DOWN WITH THE PATRIARCHY” in big bold letters. I told this bitch that the patriarchy is a feminazi conspiracy, and that I would never bang such a depressing combination of red flags. She gets pissed off and tries to argue that beauty is subjective or some shit, but I refuse to let my frame waver. She realized I was not going to give in to her neo-liberal propaganda, so she channeled her inner Feminist aura and began to transform into a mythical Feminist beast of rage.

I'm not about to let this feminist bitch cock-block me with her mythical transformations and gender equality nonsense, so I channeled my own alpha powers bequeathed upon me by TRP and unleashed my monster alpha dong. Large enough bludgeon a small child, I took hold of it with both hands like some kind of expert in dong-fu, wielding it with the skill and proficiency of a Jedi master. I lunge at the raging feminist beast, thrusting towards her in some kind of Dragonball Z-style montage, and plunge my glorious alpha meat hammer directly into her heart. She was instantly drained of her feminist powers and, as the beast let out an earth-shattering cry of defeat, withered away into a pile of dust.

All the hot virgin bitches marveled at my spectacular feat in utter disbelief, lost for words at the fact that such a dominating alpha could ever possibly exist. They instantly ripped their clothes off while denouncing Feminism permanently and accepting their subservient role in society, while making me a sandwich and literally throwing themselves at me pussy first. I let out a mighty alpha roar on par with Mufasa while I stomped the ground in a primitive caveman-like fashion (biotruths bro, bitches love cavemen) as they screamed battle cries of last minute resistance in unison, all of which were quelled as I popped like sixteen boners in preparation for the one-man-train I was about run full speed on this gaggle of swooning whores.

Then, I woke up. My premature ejaculation had apparently jolted me out of my slumber. I found myself sitting in a pool of my own alpha splooge, which soon became the protein stain that remains on my sheets as a triumphant symbol of my successful night of wooing bitches in my dreams.

All in all, I'd say it was just another average night of red pilling. TRP wins again, fellas!

Okay, so, I'm a girl and I found out about this place from Reddit. Normally I'll be pretty vocal on subreddits talking about r/incels or r/redpill or something, and this led me to someone telling me about this place. I can't believe what I'm seeing. You're all fucking pathetic. You blame women for all of your problems, yet you do nothing to try and remedy them. You sit in your dank basement, bitter and alone, thinking of ways you can get back at the world. Because people are happy, and you resent that. Because you can never be happy. You're pathetic. The bottom of the barrel. I almost feel sorry for you. 

I'm pretty resilient to misogynistic rhetoric, but visiting here, browsing through all of the pages, I feel a bit sick. How can people like you exist? You blame a whole fucking gender of people because you're so bitter, that you lost any ounce of self-respect. You lump in women as one thing, a definite measure. It's laughable. You're just lonely, bitter, twisted gremlins who don't know the touch of a woman.

You say we have it easier. That's funny. You've probably had it handed to you on a plate, but you just refused to accept it. You are pathetic, I'll say it again because it's the perfect word to describe anyone here. I've heard about this place for a long time, but only now, after 4 glasses of wine, have I decided to visit it. 

Anyway, enjoy never getting to touch someone like me. With this attitude, you're going to die alone you pathetic fucking virgins.

Dude you clearly don't know shit about Fortnite. When taking engagements like that when the person isn't even looking at you, make sure to build a nice fort, make some windows, then build some extra floors incase he rockets you, then divise a multi stage full proof plan involving 1000 wood worth of stairs. only then can you even consider moving towards him, let alone shooting. When approaching him, stealthily build stairs in a fibonacci sequence, the mathematics is very important here, i'll explain why later.
Anyway, push up on him while building a fibonacci sequence of stairs, this way you can avoid any potential shots coming your way. As you get closer, you can now consider firing off shots at a speed of 1shot/hour, this way you can maximise accuracy although at such high fire rates, accuracy is obviously not guaranteed. Now you have a huge base, a fibonacci sequence of stairs and a good chance of MAYBE killing the guy.
Now you may aim at his toe, this will give you the best chance of hitting a headshot as the toe is the closest body part to the head as I'm sure any surgeon will agree with me. If this doesn't work, you must have done something wrong.

i don't post on here often but your comment was so offensive to me i felt that i had to... Kevin Love is not an amateur model, okay? maybe the cause of confusion was that since he is already a professional athlete you believe that he can't also be a professional model. while the concept may seem foreign to lesser men, Kevin Love is clearly capable of maintaining two professions at once. the kid is an absolute squid, and he won't be stopped. i don't know how to prove this to you other than by directing you to pinterest. search pinterest for Kevin Love and you will find more pictures of his chiseled body gussied up in a tight fitting italian suit with exquisitely tailored pants than you will find of him shooting a baskeball. what would happen if i searched your name on pinterest, /u/secretlives [+1] ? would i find you looking like a sexual menace in woven wool and fine silks? no, no i would not. what about another professional athlete, such as mike trout? no it's just him playing with balls. clearly Kevin Love is renowned in many circles for his sharp dressing just as he is renowned in others for his skills on the court. like i said, the kid is a squid. he can't be stopped.

Ass is the most egalitarian of fetishes. People of all sexualities can appreciate the booty. It is given freely to all people. Unlike cock and tits you can increase your butt size by working out. Even asexuals can respect the booty, because unlike cock and tits, it's used constantly for daily life, whenever you walk and sit down. It's the muscle of the working class, used when lifting heavy objects.

To be fair, you have to have a very high IQ to understand Rainbow Six Siege. The tactical situations are very subtle, and without a solid grasp of the Operators, most of the matches will go over a typical CSGO player's head. There’s also Tachanka, who is our Lord and Savior and quite possibly the best and most difficult operator to main. He is heavily admired in our community - his personal philosophy draws heavily from the Soviet Union, for instance. The players understand this tactical stuff; they have the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate the depths of these tactical situations, to realize that they're not just efficient- they say something deep about saving the HOSTAGE. As a consequence people who dislike Rainbow Six Siege truly ARE idiots- of course they wouldn't appreciate, for instance, the courage in Tachanka's existential catchphrase "LMG, MOUNTED, AND LOADED", which itself is a cryptic reference to Turgenev's Russian epic *LMGs and SMGs*. I'm smirking right now just imagining one of those addlepated simpletons scratching their heads in confusion as Tom Clancy's genius unfolds itself on their computer screens. What fools... How I pity them. And yes, by the way, I DO have an Ash & Jäger tattoo. And no, you cannot see it. It's for the gamer girls' eyes only - and even they have to demonstrate that they're within 5 score points of my ELO (preferably lower) beforehand.

Oh, that can definitely be possible. That actually happened to me, i'm straight. 


My friend and I were in a bar, doing shots. My friend started leaning towards me and his soft, luscious, silky hands grasped  mine own.
 Our eyes locked together and we moved towards eachother hesitantly. His lips finally met mine and the kiss lingered on for a few seconds then we pulled back. His mouth opened and he said, "No homo". I nodded back, signaling that i agreed with him.

A few months passed, he now slept in my bed, we had sex every morning. But we always said no homo. Day comes when we get married, we reminisce about the day we kissed eachother, and re-live that moment when the pastor says, "You may kiss the groom". 
Even after that he said, "No homo". 

I rented out a nice hotel for us for the honeymoon. While we were having sex, he says, "I love you".
I left his gay ass after that, he didn't even say no homo...

I'm straight though.

As we made our way to the bottom, she tells me that she's a virgin and a devout Christian who told her beta boyfriend that she was saving herself for marriage, but had instantly changed her mind after her primal instincts were wooed by my alpha frame. She also literally just turned 18 like five minutes ago, and so did eight of her similarly virgin-Christian friends who were waiting at the bottom of the stairs to join in. Normally I'd be offended that a bitch would just decide to invite eight of her friends to our sexual romp without consulting me first, because bitches aren't allowed to make decisions. I happened to be in a forgiving mood today, however, so I figured I'd let it slide this time.

We get down to the bottom, and we're instantly greeted by her flock of whores who had been eagerly waiting at the foot of the stairs to cheat on their beta boyfriends. I inspect each of them closely to ensure that they're all up to my supreme standards and that none of them would lower my SMV. Most of them were hot enough to fuck I guess, until I got to the last one; a short haired, horse-owning feminist with a degree in women's studies and a t-shirt that said “DOWN WITH THE PATRIARCHY” in big bold letters. I told this bitch that the patriarchy is a feminazi conspiracy, and that I would never bang such a depressing combination of red flags. She gets pissed off and tries to argue that beauty is subjective or some shit, but I refuse to let my frame waver. She realized I was not going to give in to her neo-liberal propaganda, so she channeled her inner Feminist aura and began to transform into a mythical Feminist beast of rage.

I'm not about to let this feminist bitch cock-block me with her mythical transformations and gender equality nonsense, so I channeled my own alpha powers bequeathed upon me by TRP and unleashed my monster alpha dong. Large enough bludgeon a small child, I took hold of it with both hands like some kind of expert in dong-fu, wielding it with the skill and proficiency of a Jedi master. I lunge at the raging feminist beast, thrusting towards her in some kind of Dragonball Z-style montage, and plunge my glorious alpha meat hammer directly into her heart. She was instantly drained of her feminist powers and, as the beast let out an earth-shattering cry of defeat, withered away into a pile of dust.

All the hot virgin bitches marveled at my spectacular feat in utter disbelief, lost for words at the fact that such a dominating alpha could ever possibly exist. They instantly ripped their clothes off while denouncing Feminism permanently and accepting their subservient role in society, while making me a sandwich and literally throwing themselves at me pussy first. I let out a mighty alpha roar on par with Mufasa while I stomped the ground in a primitive caveman-like fashion (biotruths bro, bitches love cavemen) as they screamed battle cries of last minute resistance in unison, all of which were quelled as I popped like sixteen boners in preparation for the one-man-train I was about run full speed on this gaggle of swooning whores.

Then, I woke up. My premature ejaculation had apparently jolted me out of my slumber. I found myself sitting in a pool of my own alpha splooge, which soon became the protein stain that remains on my sheets as a triumphant symbol of my successful night of wooing bitches in my dreams.

All in all, I'd say it was just another average night of red pilling. TRP wins again, fellas!

Narrative is a medium of art found in all videogames, an art form Mario games have not perfected. In fact Mario Odyssey (politics aside) has done more to damage the reputation of narrative in videogames than any other game releases in 2017, including Bubsy The Woolies Strike Back. Narrative Theory has shown that even games like Tetris have less jarring and more classical narratives then Odyssey. Tetris has continual plot progression; Odyssey encourages the player to ignore Mario's objective for uncharacteristic greed. Tetris has interesting characters through Tetriminos who's separate lively personalities come from their dynamic shape-relationship with other Tetriminos and player; Odyssey has NPCs who stand around, and a few flat characters. Tetris has consistent world-building rules (only characters are you and the Tetriminos, they are antagonists, their existence is governed by not forming a complete vertical line, etc); Odyssey is meaningless, inconsistent at every turn, and unfeasible by its own interior rules.﻿

Someone remove me from this racist/sexist hate group, PLEASE. The 'Leave Group' selection is grayed out for some reason and I am unable to voluntarily leave. Please and thanks. I mean, I guess I could report the group so I could block it? I don't know. I just want out of the People's Temple. Reading posts and user comments are like they are straight from the SCUM Manifesto. All I see are women perpetuating hate and racism against white men. I have enough 'white, manly guilt' and severe anxiety as it is without reading commentary that makes it worse.

Sometimes I think my cat is a bit of a queer, not there's anything wrong with that of course. It's just that he's affectionate. Like super affectionate. He's always trying to sit on my lap and rub his face on me. It's suspect behavior if you ask me. Like, I get it. We're bros and all, but even bros have to have boundaries. One time I was napping on my couch and he just jumps on my chests and rubs my face with his nose. And during this he was purring constantly, as though he was enjoying it. Isn't that a sign of deviant behavior? He didn't even say "no homo," which of course would've made everything alright. When I change my clothes he watches me, and whenever I take a piss, he's always weaving in between my legs and rubbing up against them. Like dude, my cock is out. Show some goddamn respect for my privacy. He even sleeps in the same bed as me if I forget to shut my door at night. Am I crazy, or is all that a tad odd? My cat and I have a good thing going on, and I'm worried that his latent homosexual tendencies are going to ruin things between us.

The Bladedancers deride us as slow. The Gunslingers say we lack precision. “How is that better than a knife?” “How is that better than a flaming pistol?” Well.

“We're almost there,” my Ghost chirps. My jaw clenches. I know we're almost there, little Light.

This vile marsh opens to reveal a black cave's maw. Inside, an infinite number of little green eyes flicker like bad stars. CRACK! I fire a single bullet into the air and the horde in the cave shrieks and runs out.

“This is it, you two.” The Warlock and Titan leap from the bog behind me. A bow appears in my hands and I let a single binding shot loose from the shadow.

I listen to a lot of music but not a lot of rap/hiphop for exactly the reason that I don't like this album: because this album appears to just be someone shouting into a mic about how awesome they are, or how hard life is, or how unfair people are to them. If I wanted to listen to someone whinge about their life, I'd find some teenagers and ask them how their week has been. Don't get me wrong, I like some hiphop/rap, I'm a big fan of some of Eminem's stuff, and I like a bit of Aesop Rock, Snoop Dogg and 50 Cent now and then, and I adore dan le sac vs Scroobius pip. I just can't seem to enjoy someone talking about themselves for 30 minutes. I want them to talk about something that matters to me. Mosh (by Eminem) is a perfect example of how to do this, Angles (by dan le sac vs Scroobius Pip) is a song that made a huge impact on me. Someone screaming about how awesome they are, or how many girls dig them, just doesn't hold anywhere near that weight. As Scroobius Pip says:

Their lyrical prognosis is like spiritual osmosis

In that everything they say evaporates into boasts - it's a joke!

I've listened and I can't even find one quote

Why would they take away our haven?

We have no safe place to chill and be ourselves or enjoy life.

Everyone wants us eliminated or dead.

The fact that violent Chads get hired more than basement dwellers shows how much of a threat society sees us as.

I feel like there is just no hope for us in America.

We get bullied by normies and then blamed for our own deaths.

We do everything right then when nothing comes of it we're blamed for following the program.

Why do all my lollipops moan when I put them in my mouth?

First of all, get your mind out of the gutter. “Lollipop” isn’t a euphemism for anything else. This is serious.

It’s been like this since I was a kid. I’d never thought about telling anyone because I worried people would think I was either nuts or gay; where I live, those two labels carry similar stigmas.


 
To be honest, I’m only mentioning it now because it’s starting to get really weird.

Ok, weirder.

First, let me just give you an example of how this all normally works. I work at a pediatrician’s office, so, of course, there are lots of lollipops to go around. I was finishing up my shift when I felt my blood sugar tanking a bit, so I grabbed a Dum Dums mystery flavor lollipop, unwrapped it, and popped it in my mouth. I love the mystery flavors. They’re just so….mysterious.


 
Anyway, I absentmindedly sucked it while cleaning up my desk, when, on cue, the sounds started.
“Mmmm, yes.”

“Oh good heavens, don’t stop.”

I’m the only one who can hear this, mind you. Shay was working right next to me and didn’t notice a thing. Regardless, the voice persisted and grew in enthusiasm as I got closer to finishing it. As always, as the last bit of candy dissolved, I heard a grunt and a muffled “thank you.” Then it was gone.

That’s not normal, right?

It’s possible this is all in my head. I’ll freely admit it. Still, there’s just something too tangible about the whole thing to make me truly think I’m hallucinating.

Then there was what happened yesterday.

I was at work and we were leaving early because there was a snowstorm on the way. Shay was calling patients to reschedule their appointments while I billed the insurance companies for the patients we’d had earlier. The weather man, Chuck Gerrard, aka: “Dewey Doppler,” was doing a live broadcast in front of his maps and showing the predicted snow accumulations.


 
I watched and grabbed a cherry lollipop. I unwrapped it and put it in my mouth. The weather man paused and his eyebrows arched for a second, but then he continued his forecast. I didn’t think much of it.

I manipulated the candy with my lips and tongue and the familiar “mmmmm” filled my skull. Dewey Doppler started to look bewildered and uncomfortable. He was walking strangely but still going on with the broadcast. It was unusual; Dewey Doppler never messed up. He’s a consummate professional. Something had to have been wrong.

I studied Dewey as I sucked the lollipop. His face was getting red and the HD image of his face showed beads of sweat appearing on his brow. A disturbing pang of realization struck me.

With experimental deliberateness, I pulled the lollipop out of my mouth, then licked all around its circumference as I studied the weather man’s face. The moaning in my mind grew fervid and Dewey stumbled as he walked across to the other side of the map. His hand was down by his waist, as if he were covering something. I was fascinated.

“Don’t stop, please.”

The words in my mind were insistent and Dewey Doppler was standing with a slight hunch, but still soldiered on with the forecast.

“Hnnnnnnnng….”

The doctor burst into the office, startling me out of my concentration. Without thinking, I bit down on the lollipop. A shrill, hysterical screech came from the television. Shay, the doctor, and I all turned toward the sound of pain and saw a wide patch of dark red blooming across the front of the weather man’s pants. He clutched his crotch and screamed again. The video cut to commercial.

“What the hell was that?,” the doctor asked.

“I…I don’t know,” I stammered.

“Wow, that poor man,” Shay sighed, then went back to her phone calls.

The doctor went about his business and Shay went about hers. I sat in my chair and tried to work, but the flavor of cherry in my mouth didn’t taste so sweet anymore. And in my head, I still heard Dewey Doppler screaming.

Hi, you're on a rock, floating in space. Pretty cool, huh? Some of it's water. Fuck it, actually, most of it's water. I can't even get from here to there without buying a boat. It's sad. I'm sad. I miss you.

#H O W D I D T H I S H A P P E N ?

A long time ago... actually, never, and also now, nothing is nowhere. When? Never. Makes sense, right? Like I said, it didn't happen. Nothing was never anywhere. That's why it's been everywhere. It's been so everywhere, you don't need a "where". You don't even need a "when". That's how "every" it gets.

...

Forget this, I wanna be something, go somewhere, do something. I want things to change, I want to invent time and space, and I know it's possible because everything is here, and it probably already happened. I just don't know when to start... and that's exactly where it started.

#⏪

Woah, I paused it. I think there's a universe now. What's it made of?

#Q U A R K S A N D S T U F F

Ah, that's a thing, in a place! Don't like it? Try a new place, at a different time. Try to stick together, because the world is gonna get bigger and emptier... but it's not empty yet. It's still very full, and about a kjghpillion degrees.

*<about no seconds later>*

Great news! The quarks are now happily married in groups of three, called a "proton" or a "neutron", and there's something else flying around that wants to join in, but can't cause it's still too

#**H O T**

Great news! The protons and neutrons are now happily married to each other! Some of them even doubled up.

Great news! The electrons have now joined in.

Congratulations, THE WORLD IS NOW a bunch of gas in space... but it's getting closer together...

...and it's getting closer together...

...and it's getting closer toget-

What?

#S O M E T H I N G ' S A L I V E I N T H E O C E A N

Oh, cool! Like, a plant or an animal? No, a microscopic speck! It lives at the bottom of the ocean and eats chemical soup, which is being served hot and fresh, made from *gnarly space ingredients* left over from when it was raining rocks or whatever...

*<microscopic speck reproduces asexually>*

Oh yeah, and it can do that.

*<microscopic specks reproduce asexually three more times>*

It has secret instructions written inside itself, telling it how to build another one of itself. So, that's pretty nifty, I would say. Tired of living at the bottom of the ocean?

#N O W Y O U C A N E A T S U N L I G H T

Side effect: Now there's oxygen everywhere and the sky is blue. Then the Earth might have been a snowball for a while, maybe even a couple of times.

It's a sponge, it's a plant, it's a worm, and some other types of weird, stranger water bugs and strange fish.

#I T ' S T H E C A M B R I A N E X P L O S I O N

It's mammal time, here come the mammals. Look at those breasts. Now they're gonna dominate the world, but one of them just learned how to grab stuff and walk. No, like, walk like that, and grab stuff at the same time, and bang rocks together to make pointed rocks.

"Ouch."

And set things on fire.

"Yeouch."

And make crazy sounds with their voice.

"Gneurshk."

Which can mean different things.

#T H A T ' S A H U M A N P E R S O N

And now they're everywhere...almost.

#I C E A G E

What? You can walk over here? Cool!

#N O T A N Y M O R E

Well, I guess we're stuck here. Let's review: There's people on the planet, and they're chasing their food. "Fuck it, time to plant some grass. Look at this, I get to control the food now. Now, everyone will want to be my friend and live near me. Let's all build houses, except mine is bigger because I own the food." This is great! I wonder if anyone else is doing this?

Tired of using rocks for everything? Use metal! It's underground. Better farming was just invented in a sweet dank valley right in between these two rivers, and the animals are helping.

#G U E S S W H A T H A P P E N S N E X T ?

More food, and more people who came to buy the food. Now you need people to help make the food and keep track of the sales, and now you need house for people to live in and people to make the houses and now there's more people to make more things for more people and now there's business, money, writing, laws, power.

"Hi, everything's great," said some guy who seems to be getting very popular and is then arrested and killed for being too popular, which actually makes him more popular. You could make a religion out of this!

Deep in the Arabian desert, on the top of a mountain, the real God whispers in Muhammad's ear. So, he goes down to the cube where everyone worships gods and tells them their gods are all fake, and everyone got so mad at him that he had to leave town and go to a different town. You could make a religion out of this, and maybe conquer the world as well.

The Franks have the biggest kingdom in Europe, and the Pope is so proud that he invites the King over for Christmas. "Surprise! You're the new Roman Emperor!" said the Pope, pretending to still be part of the Roman Empire. Then, the Franks broke their kingdom into what will later be called France and not-France.

The Northerners, or just "Norse" if you don't have much time, are exploring. They go north, from the north to the northern north, and they find some land. Two types of land, and they name them accordingly.

They also invade some other places and get called many names, such as "Vikings". There's the Rus, the Kievan Rus. Are they Vikings? "I don't think so," said the Kievan Rus. Okay, fair enough.

"Aah!" said the Byzantine Empire, who's getting so small and almost doesn't exist anymore. "We need help!" They need help, so they call the Pope. "Hey Pope, can you help us get rid of the Seljuks, maybe take back the Holy Land on the way? C'mon, I know you want to take back the Holy Land." "Yes, I do actually want to do that. Let's do a Crusade."

They did many Crusades, some of which almost didn't fail, but at least the Italians got some sweet trade deals.

Look at those mounds.

There's the Pueblo. I always wondered how to build a town in a cliff.

Guess who's here? Khmer. Where? Here, and Pagan is there. Vietnam unconquered itself, Korea just became itself, and Japan is so addicted to art that the military might have to take over the government. China just invented bombs and typing, and the Mongols just invaded most of the Universe. Nice going, Genghis! I bet that will last a long time.

*<Mongolian empire breaks>*

Some of the Islamic Turks were unaffected by the Mongol invasions because they were too busy invading India.

Is it Tonga time? I think it's Tonga time.

I just figured out where the Swahili gets all their gold. Look at this chad! It means "lake". There's an empire there, right in the middle of

The King of Mali is so rich, he's going on tour to let everyone know. "Wow, that guy's rich," everyone said.

The Christians are doing a great job reconquering Iberia, which will soon be called Spain and not-Spain. Please remain Christian, we will check in later to see if you are still Christian when you least expect it.

Whoops, half of Europe just died.

China's back, yay!

Hey, Khmer, time to share. New kingdoms, here and there. Oh, look who controls all the islands, it's the Mahajapit.

Oh, Italy's real rich, time for them to care a lot about art and the ancient classics. It's kinda like a rebirth. Here's a printer, let's make books!

*So you think you can conquer the Byzantine Empire?* "Yep," said the Ottoman Turks. Nice job, Ottoman Turks. Oops, you missed a spot. Don't forget to ban Europe from the Indian spice trade. "What? That's bullshit!" said Portugal, spiceless.

#W E L L I G U E S S W E ' L L H A V E T O F I N D A N O T H E R W A Y T O I N D I A

"Wait!" said Christopher Columbus, probably smoking crack. "If the world is round, let's go this way to India!" "Nah, don't worry, we already got this," said Portugal. So, Chris goes to Spain. "Hey Spain, wanna hire me to find India by going around back of the world?"

"No."

"Please?"

"No."

"Please?"

"No." ^^^"wtf"

"Please?"

"...okay."

So he sails into the ocean and discovers... more ocean, and then discovers the Indies and Japan! Let's draw a line to decide who gets which half of the world.

The Aztec and the Inca empires are off to a great start. I wonder if they know that Europe just discovered their continent.

The Habsburgs are marrying into so many royal families, they might have to start marrying each other.

Move over, Lithuania, here comes Moscow. Ivan wants to make Russia great again. Move over, Timurids, maybe go invade India or something. Persia just made Persia Persian again. Let's make it the other kind of Islam, the one where we thought the first guy should've been the other guy.

"Hey Christians, do you sin? Now you can buy your way out of Hell!" "That's bullshit, this whole thing is bullshit, that's a scam, fuck the Church, here's 95 reasons why," said Martin Luther, in his new book which might have accidentally started the Protestant Reformation.

"You know what would be magnificent?" said Suleiman, wearing an onion hat. "What if the Ottoman Empire was... really big?" which it is now. "What if Russia was big?" said Ivan, trying not to be terrible.

Portugal had a dream that they controlled the entire Indian Ocean, including the spice trade, and then that dream was real. And Spain realized that this is not India, but they pillaged it anyway. "Damn," said England and France, "we gotta start pillaging some stuff." Then the Dutch revolt, and all the hipsters moved to Amsterdam. "Damn," said Amsterdam, "...we gotta start pillaging some stuff."

Question one: Can you get to India from North America? No, but at least there's beaver. Question two: Steal the spice trade. That's not a question, but the Dutch did it anyway.

Guess where all the sugar is made? In Brazil... stolen! In the Caribbean, and it's so goddamn profitable, you might forget to do slavery.

The next thing on Russia's to-do list is to get bigger.

Britain and France are having a friendly discussion about who should control the world, more specifically, Ohio. Then, it escalates into a seven-year discussion, giving Prussia a chance to show Austria who's boss. But, what about Britain and France, did they figure out who's boss? Yes, they did, it's Britain. Guess who's broke? Also Britain. So, they start taxing the hell out of America. "Fuck you!" said America, declaring their independence and fighting for it, and France helps them win. Now, France is broke, and Britain will have to send their prisoners to a different continent.

Wait, if France is broke, why do the King and Queen still wear such fancy dresses? "Let's overthrow the palace and cut all their heads off!" said Robespierre, cutting everybody's head off until someone eventually got mad and cut his head off. You can make a reli-

No, don't.

Haiti is starting to like the idea of a revolution, especially the slaves, who free themselves by killing their masters. "Why didn't we think of this before?"

Wait, who's in charge of France now?

Said Napoleon, trying to take over Europe. Luckily, they banished him to an island.

#B U T H E C A M E B A C K

Luckily, they banished him to another island.

There goes Latin America, becoming independent in the Latin American wars of independence.

Britain just figured out how to turn steam into power, so now they can make

Then they invent some trains and conquer India, and maybe put some trains there. "Hey, China!" said Britain, "buy stuff from us!" "Nah dude, we already got everything," says China, so Britain tried to get them addicted to opium, which worked actually, but then China made it illegal and dumped it all in the sea, so Britain threw a hissy fit and made them open up five cities and give them an island.

Britain and Russia are playing a game where they try to stop the other person from conquering Afghanistan. Also,

India just had a revolution and they would like to govern themselves now. "Nope," said Britain, governing them even harder than before.

The United States finally figured out whether slavery is good or bad. It's bad, they decided, and then they continued manifesting their destiny, which is to kill the rest of the natives and take their land and maybe kick out the Mexicans too.

"I know, let's rape Africa!" said Europe, scrambling to see who could rape it the fastest.

The United States ran out of destiny to manifest, so they're looking for more.

Wait, Spain controls Cuba. "Well, blame something on them and go to war. What should we blame on Spain?"

*<U.S.S. Maine sinks>*

"Let's blame the Maine on Spain." So they blame the Maine on Spain. Now we're in business. To celebrate, they kick Panama out of Panama and make a canal, connecting the two oceans.

Britain just found oil in the Middle East.

China is so tired of being bossed around that they delete their old government and make a new, stronger government... which is accidentally weaker and is controlled by a guy from the previous government.

Europe hasn't had a war since the last war, so they start World War One. Look at those guns! It's gonna be a great war, so great we won't need a second one. After it's over, they blame Germany.

Russia went on strike and the workers overthrew the government, now everyone's paycheck is the same.

"Let's cut the cake!" said Sykes and Picot, carving up the remains of the not-so-Ottoman-anymore-empire.

And then the Saudis conquer Arabia. It just seemed like the right thing to do.

*<ring ring>*

"Hello?" "Yes, it's the 1920's calling. Let's get to a car and drive to a party and listen to jazz on the radio and go to the movies! The economy is great and it will probably be great forever... just kidding."

Germany's back, featuring Hitler, the angry mustache model, and he's mad at the Jews for existing.

Japan is finally conquering the East, and they're so excited, they rape Nanking way too hard. They should probably just deny it.

Hitler's out of control, so the international community tackles him and tries to explain to him why killing all the Jews is a bad idea, but he kills himself before they could explain it to him.

"Wow, that worked?"

Bonus, now there's Pakistan. Actually, two Pakistans. One of them can be Bangladesh later.

The Jews and the Arabs finally figured out which one of them should live in the holy land. "Me!" they both said at the same time. Let's divide up the lands so we're both happy.

#S I K E ! T H E Y B O T H G E T A N G R I E R

Look out, China! There's a new China in China! What's on the menu? Communism! "No thanks," said the other China, escaping to an island. I wonder which one is the real China?

There's the Korean War, Korea vs. Korea! Nobody wins, then it's on pause forever. Let's meet the sponsors. Oh, it's the two global superpowers. They're having a friendly debate over which economic system is good and which one is an evil virus of Satan.

And they both have atom bombs.

FIGHT!

Wait, no, that would be the end of the world. Let's just keep it cool and spy on each other instead... and make sure we have enough atom bombs. "I'll race you to space!"

*<Russia puts a satellite in orbit>*

*<United States puts a flag on the moon>*

Now let's make more countries fight themselves.

Europe is tired of pillaging other continents, and the continents they were pillaging are tired of being pillaged, so here's a new map with new countries. Now you can't tell who they're being pillaged by.

The United States finally decided whether racism is good or bad. They decided it's bad and the world agrees. South Africa might need another minute to think about it.

Let's check the world population!

*<huge exponential rise>*

Woah.

Okay.

The Soviet Union decides to relax a little and accidentally falls apart.

Europe makes a union so now they can all use the same money, except Britain, because they don't feel likt it.

Let's check the mail. Surprise, it's on the computer!

Whoops, someone just attacked America, I bet they'll remember that.

Phone call. Surprise, it's in your pocket! Wanna learn everything? Surprise, it's on the computer! Now your phone's a computer, which is in your pocket!

Whoops, the economy just crashed. Don't worry, the big banks won't fail, because they're not supposed to.

Surprise! Flying robots... with bombs!

Some people have no friends. Some people have no food. The globe is warming.

To be fair, you have to have a very high IQ to understand Dom Capers. The playcalls are extremely subtle, and without a solid grasp of leaving the middle of the field wide open most of the 3rd down conversions will go over a typical viewer’s heads. There’s also Dom’s “Bend and Break” outlook, which is deftly woven into his defensive scheme - his personal hatred for covering running backs, for instance. The fans understand this stuff, they have the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate the depths of this defense, to realise that it’s not just elite, they say something deep about the NFL. As a consequence, people who dislike Dom Capers truly ARE idiots- of course they wouldn’t appreciate, the humour in Caper’s existential catchphrase “We have to do a better job” which itself is a cryptic reference to Mike McCarthy’s postgame speeches after every game he loses with conservative playcalling. I’m smirking right now just imagining one of those addlepated simpletons scratching their heads in confusion as Ted Thompson’s genious wit unfolds in front of their eyes on their television screens. What fools .. how I pity them 😂

And yes, by the way, i DO have a Packers XLV Super Bowl Champs Cheesehead tattoo And no, you cannot see it. It’s for the ladies’ eyes only- and even then they have to demonstrate that they’re within 5 Body Fat Percentage points of my own (preferably higher) beforehand.

🙅 Buzz is a hypocrite! 👏 Let me explain for anyone who cannot grasp the irony behind his statement: Buzz Lightyear did not think he was a toy yet still froze when humans were around. How can you explain that? 🤔 Toy Story has plot holes while George RR's writing is slightly deeper than the Disney film in question but what it gains in depth it loses in overall value. 😧 Toy Story has so many themes that are purposely simple to convey different messages to a wider audience regardless of age or background, think FAMILY with a demographic of 0 to infinity. 👨‍👩‍👧‍👦 Game of Thrones is just tragic (so far), and while unlikely, might end on a slightly positive note either for fan favorite characters or the general population leftover. The Toy Story series is an emotional rollercoaster 🎢 where our protagonists triumph giving it's viewers satisfaction while building morals for the young or establishing a connection with people who already have such values instilled. Game of Thrones gives itself more layers but each layer is shallow and doesn't reward enough unless you enjoy being shocked more than a satisfying story. Toy Story lacks the twists of Game of Thrones but puts so much more emotion into every other aspect to make up for the subtleties. Moving on... Rick and Morty, however, is the best of both worlds. The superior anime art style of Toy Story is an aspect created in order to do things we simply can't pull off with actual actors and eclipses Game of Thrones cgi bullshit if we're being honest. 💩 Rick and Morty has millions more layers than Game of Thrones because it caters to an audience as large as Toy Story while adding jokes that would go over the average user's head and Elon Musk level intelligent science for those who have a high IQ like me. Imagine Toy Story and Game of Thrones combined and remove every single thing you hate about both and it still wouldn't be as great as Rick and Morty. When the toys joined hands in Toy Story 3 during the incerator scene I cried so hard I pooped my pants. 😭 When Ned, and later Robb, perished during Game of Thrones it made me almost quit the series. 🚫 However, when Bird Person was betrayed by the love of his life I never hated a character more than Tammy.😠 This almost killed me when I smashed my TV into oblivion with a bare fist kung fu tiger-style! 🐆 The rage in my heart still boils in my heart. 💔 To top that off, one of the several billion references even targeted Star Wars by bringing Bird Person back from the dead not too different to that of Anakin Skywalker AKA Darth Vader. That alone captured the nostalgia and all the emotions felt through YEARS of watching Star Wars only to be cultivated and reformed even stronger through Bird Person. Name one death in Game of Thrones more shocking than Bird Person, I'll wait... oh you can't? I thought so! When anyone is r/gatekeeping I chuckle and to be fair sometimes accidently fart since they probably can't even understand why Rick Sanchez would turn himself into a pickle and then I have to explain for 30 minutes to little or no avail. 🥒 The fart jokes alone are more intelligent than George RR Martin since they're woven perfectly into place of the fabrics of time and space itself whilst happening enough to cater dummies and solemnly enough to evoke the occasional chuckle from people with high IQ's like myself.

TLDR: Rick and Morty > everything else > Toy Story > most things > Game of Thrones > average content on TV watered down for idjits.

And YES, I do have a Rick and Morty crossover tattoo of Rick C-137 as Buzz and Cowboy Morty as Woody (for the ladies 👀 only) but you have to qoute enough lines from both series in order to see it, and that's AFTER proving your IQ is high enough to date me. 😂

"Why does this sub only use memes from the prequels? I'm guessing this is some kind of exercise in snarky postmodernism? Let's take this little loved trio of films with almost zero cultural cache and pretend we can all quote them by heart? Or perhaps buzzfeed style 90's nostalgia? Either way it's pretty pathetic, especially with so much important things going on in the world you people only care about being in on some smug inside joke."

...

"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rohingya_people https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_withdrawal_from_the_Paris_Agreement Yeah we're living in peaceful times alright, but hurr durr let's pretent Anakins lines were actually profound and well written!
"And make no mistake: irony tyrannizes us. The reason why our pervasive cultural irony is at once so powerful and so unsatisfying is that an ironist is impossible to pin down. All irony is a variation on a sort of existential poker-face. All U.S. irony is based on an implicit "I don't really mean what I say." So what does irony as a cultural norm mean to say? That it's impossible to mean what you say? That maybe it's too bad it's impossible, but wake up and smell the coffee already? Most likely, I think, today's irony ends up saying: "How very banal to ask what I mean." Anyone with the heretical gall to ask an ironist what he actually stands for ends up looking like a hysteric or a prig. And herein lies the oppressiveness of institutionalized irony, the too-successful rebel: the ability to interdict the question without attending to its content is tyranny. It is the new junta, using the very tool that exposed its enemy to insulate itself.
This is why our educated teleholic friends' use of weary cynicism to try to seem superior to TV is so pathetic. And this is why the fiction-writing citizen of our televisual culture is in such deep doo. What do you do when postmodern rebellion becomes a pop-cultural institution? For this of course is the second clue to why avant-garde irony and rebellion have become dilute and malign. They have been absorbed, emptied, and redeployed by the very televisual establishment they had originally set themselves athwart." -David Foster Wallace."

...

"By putting on your government to intervene perhaps? None of has any real idea what we're talking about. It is only ever possible to "prove" anything in mathematics, everything else gets bogged down in relativism and the postmodern bog which makes everyone apathetic and resort to empty nihilistic exercises like this sub."

Thanks Facebook
> 
> It's clear they don't know that Christ was never a person, it's an archetypal energy of personal liberation and the alchemical preparation of the body for evolutionary upgrades. Jesus dying at 33 years of age represents the rising of the Christ energy up the 33 veretbrae of the spine to become enlightened, thus the Golden halo around the heads of Christ and followers. Whenever you are truly happy in the flow of life you are filled with Christ energy, but unahapiness, stress and other emotional imabalances burn the oils. The Christ allegory was turned into a literal story so people would not understand what it means or how to proceed. Sad to say modern christianity has nothing with Christ except to worship his dead corpse and eat his flesh and drink his blood, which should give everybody a clue about as to what the church is about. It's death cult......riddled with sickness. And yet the alchemical symbolism is still there. And it doesn't matter what you call the process, call it whatever you want, and make it yours. There's no blasphemy in a true search for who you are :)

To be fair, you have to have a very high IQ to understand Youtube Rewind. The humour is extremely subtle, and without a solid grasp of theoretical physics most of the jokes will go over a typical viewer’s head. There’s also Youtube Rewind’s nihilistic outlook, which is deftly woven into his characterisation- his personal philosophy draws heavily from Narodnaya Volya literature, for instance.

Imagine being Chris Hemsworth in that scene and having to be all like "damn, Cate Blanchett, you fuckin' evil, all menacing with your tight body and jet-black hair. I would totally hit you with a hammer, both my character and the real me." when all he really wants to do is fuck her brains out in his dressing room. Like seriously imagine having to be Chris Hemsworth and not only sit in that chair while Cate Blanchett flaunts her perfect MILF body in front of you, the skin-tight costume leaving little to the imagination, and just sit there, take after take, hour after hour, while she perfected that dance. Not only having to tolerate her costume with the suggestive little tears but her friendly attitude as everyone on set tells her she's SO NICE and DAMN, CATE BLANCHETT IS THAT *APPROACHABLE*?? because they're not the ones who was unaware that a 48-year old could be this sexy before that day. You've been only fucking a bunch of thots and groupies and later alleged rape victims for your ENTIRE CAREER coming straight out of the boonies in Australia. You've never even seen anything this fucking hot before, and now you swear you can taste the sweat that's breaking out on her stomach, herself embarassed that you have to put up with this mother of four (for that is what she calls herself), with a beauty she somehow maintained all these years. And then Taika Waititi calls for another take, and you know you could kill every single person in this room before the studio security could put you down, but you sit there and endure, because you're fucking Thor. You're not going to lose future MCU sequels and spin-offs over this. Just bear it. Hide your erection and bear it.

Oh, that can definitely be possible. That actually happened to me, i'm straight. 


My friend and I were in a bar, doing shots. My friend started leaning towards me and his soft, luscious, silky hands grasped  mine own.
 Our eyes locked together and we moved towards eachother hesitantly. His lips finally met mine and the kiss lingered on for a few seconds then we pulled back. His mouth opened and he said, "No homo". I nodded back, signaling that i agreed with him.

A few months passed, he now slept in my bed, we had sex every morning. But we always said no homo. Day comes when we get married, we reminisce about the day we kissed eachother, and re-live that moment when the pastor says, "You may kiss the groom". 
Even after that he said, "No homo". 

I rented out a nice hotel for us for the honeymoon. While we were having sex, he says, "I love you".
I left his gay ass after that, he didn't even say no homo...

I'm straight though.

Part of me finds this arousing, but the studious gentlemanly side of my brain which only values the eternal truths, finds this a tad too promiscuous. The thrill should be that of an innocent woman like the woman who smiles at me in the library having a temporary exhibitionist thrill by showing off her cunny for the thrill of hard working men, but it should still be saved for touching by a man who nervously worked up the energy to talk to her tripping over his words and she smiles and finds his nervousness charming and they agree to meet for coffee and she surpriseshim by rubbing "something" under the table and spits it all over him laughing at his puberty laugh bolt upright sitting reaction. Then incredibly carnal yet somehow pure and chaste lovemaking, her gonewild days a fun memory of her "wild side" in her youth. To openly entertain sexual propositions,even fromwomen is hurting that illusion and cognitive dissonance for me, so I would please ask you to entertain such offers in pm's so as not to challenge my perceptions of you, thanks!

OK this is the internet and I know people lie on it, but bear with me cuz this shit actually happened. It's not copypasta. 

My dad briefly dated Aaron Judge's mom Patty in high school and they ended things on good terms. They even got back in touch a few years back after he figured out social media. They send each other family photos, swap work stories (they are all retired teachers) and occasionally even skype on holidays. 

Last thanksgiving, I was over at my dad's and Aaron was visiting while they were skyping. His mom knows from my dad that I'm a huge yankees fan and she offered to introduce us.

Well, Aaron would have none of it. First he pretended to not hear her while she awkwardly made excuses for him that he was busy preparing the turkey in the kitchen (we could see him right behind her coloring with crayons or some shit), but then he rolled his eyes and said "for fuck's sake" loud enough for us to hear.

He finally came over into full view and I shit you not, was wearing a bib and holding massive turkey legs in each of his hands. He didn't say a goddamn word. No hello or hi or even a smile. He just looked into the camera with dead eyes and just sucked the meat right off the turkey bones, one at a time, like a little kid sucking jelly off his fingers. 

Fucking Aaron Judge.

This is Monthy Python at its best! No holds barred (anything goes), bizzare and making fun of the pretentious middle/upper class. 

All in one (gross) package! 

If it's no holds barred in the sketch,the funny thing  (if you look at the full version) is the  "holding back" that both the guests and the staff at the restaurant do, just  not to offend the all important, VIP, filthy rich,  very regular guest Mr Creosote, even to the point of themselves throwing up!  

Gross, yes, but you would have to be a braindead zombie if you don't find anything in this sketch funny(as some commenters).
And the mint wafer self-combustion at the end is just a classic laugh explosion! 

Love how John dives for the trenches(like the tiny mint was a hand grenade). 

The regular guest "MR Creosote" problem solved  for the restaurant in the most devious way possible. 

The first time I saw it I just died with laughter.

Dude you clearly don't know shit about Fortnite. When taking engagements like that when the person isn't even looking at you, make sure to build a nice fort, make some windows, then build some extra floors incase he rockets you, then divise a multi stage full proof plan involving 1000 wood worth of stairs. only then can you even consider moving towards him, let alone shooting. When approaching him, stealthily build stairs in a fibonacci sequence, the mathematics is very important here, i'll explain why later.
Anyway, push up on him while building a fibonacci sequence of stairs, this way you can avoid any potential shots coming your way. As you get closer, you can now consider firing off shots at a speed of 1shot/hour, this way you can maximise accuracy although at such high fire rates, accuracy is obviously not guaranteed. Now you have a huge base, a fibonacci sequence of stairs and a good chance of MAYBE killing the guy.
Now you may aim at his toe, this will give you the best chance of hitting a headshot as the toe is the closest body part to the head as I'm sure any surgeon will agree with me. If this doesn't work, you must have done something wrong.

EDIT: Sorry, I forgot to explain the reasoning behind doing the fibonacci sequence, by doing this, the amount of stairs you build infront of the guy will gradually increase, leading to an increase in cover as you travel towards the target.

EDIT 2:
To any of you who don't have a decent grasp of theoretical physics, don't even try this complicated method of play.

"Marshmallow (voiced by Dane Boedigheimer) - The sole non-fruit in the group, Marshmallow is a cute, adorable, eternally upbeat, rainbow- and unicorn-obsessed ray of fluffy, sugary sunshine. The episode "Marshmalia" indicates his name is Winky. Marshmallow's temper usually appears non-existent, but in the very rare instances it has appeared results in large explosions leading directly to gruesome, mentally-scaring injuries being inflicted on everyone present. After being sued in class action lawsuit for this, Marshmallow found himself hundreds of millions of dollars in debt, and was forced into prostitution and drug dealing to survive. After five months of smuggling cocaine across the Mexican-American border, Marshmallow was suddenly cut off from his suppliers by the construction of Donald Trump's border wall. Before he could react to this complication, Marshmallow was captured by federal investigators and sentenced to serve twenty years in maximum-security prison, however, after serving only three weeks, the Ninth Circuit ruled that Donald Trump's Presidency violated their special version of the Constitution that they have exclusive access to, and ordered the border wall dismantled, reconnecting Marshmallow with his partners in Mexico, who soon broke him out of prison with a helicopter escape. Outraged by this, Congress, at the urging of President Pence, swiftly declared war on Mexico, who surrendered after twenty minutes of fighting that led to the destruction of half of their country. Marshmallow was then promptly tried by U.S. military courts that were now operating in occupied Mexico, which found Marshmallow guilty of contempt of court and sentenced him to exile. However, Marshmallow challenged this ruling, alleging that as an American citizen he was entitled to a trial in a civilian court, citing ex parte Milligan as precedence. The Supreme Court agreed with Marshmallow and ordered his sentence stayed and his case remanded to civilian court. Marshmallow is currently awaiting trial."

As do I, but this just got much sexier.. fuck. Mm well what if I was to pin those sexy hips of yours down? Sliding only the tip of my throbbing hard cock inside you? Slowly pulling it in and out and back in... making your hips thrust against me trying to take more inside. While I'm sure it'd be as hard to resit your wet pussy tightening around me, I think hearing you moans and seeing you squirm would be worth the torture..
It does... I'd be throbbing and dripping.. aching to slide all 8 inches of my cock deep inside you. I'd start with just an inch... slowly taking it out.. then two... and so on. Making you feel me inch by inch slowly going deeper inside you.
Making your body ache and squirm for all of me.
Mm and then on that final push, I wouldn't go slow. I'd thrust all 8 inches of my cock deep inside you. I'd fuck you hard and fast.. making you moan out in pleasure.. just when you're at your peak.. I'd stop..
Mm I'd just to feel you thrust against me. Only this time I wouldn't pin you down. I'd let you grind against me. I'd let your body whimper and beg and thrust. Taking whatever length of my cock inside. I'd make you beg for more. Then the moment you beg, I'd fuck you hard again... all 8 inches thrusting inside you. Your body tightening around every inch.. your back arching and you meaning in ecstacy as I fill you.
I want to turn you on.. I want to make you feel good [yournamehere]:x
Mm could I persuade you to tease yourself to the story? I would love to make you finish. The thought of your body trembling and whimpering as you moan and cum is absolutely sexy.

Man’s got sauce. You don’t force the sauce. Sauce is something, you either have it or you don’t. Can you ask a egg, “How do you have your yolk?” You can’t. Either man’s got the yolk, or man ain’t got the yolk. Man’s got the yolk. Can you ask Heinz how you make ketchup? You can’t. Can you ask Heinz how you make baked beans? You can’t. Can you ask Heinz, “How does man make mayonnaise?” You can’t. Can you ask them about how you make salad cream? You can’t. How you gonna ask a man with sauce, how you get sauce? Either man’s got sauce, or man’s got no sauce. And I’ve got sauce.

And what's more? I laugh at guys like you. When you cry about how much girls treat you bad, and wonder why they can't just see that you're a nice guy who would always treat them right? I nod and tell you to hang in there, you'll find someone right for you someday, don't give up hope man. But inside? I'm laughing my ass off at you you pathetic fuck. Every girl you set your sights on, who isn't a disgusting pig-monster, I'm going to fuck 6 ways from sunday before you even tell her you think she's cute. I won't bother trying when you finally settle for that 350 pound girl who works at hardees, you can have that. Anything else I'm going to cum on her face before you get those lips near it.
And the biggest reason I laugh? It's not me doing all this. It's the girls. When you cry about how lonely you are? Or talk about how you just want to curl up and disappear, and all that emo bullshit? You're triggering her "Don't fuck" instinct something fierce. You're a miserable weak coward, why would she want your genes? Feel free to buy her a new computer and help her decorate her apartment, you're great for that. But her baby-maker is barking orders at her, telling her to wrap her legs around me and hold on for as long as she can. She needs it, on a primal level you'll never get to see first hand, even if you do get a chance to fuck her. Sooner or later one of them will lay back and spread their legs, but you won't see any hunger in their eyes. They won't beg you to love them forever and make them yours. You won't know what it's like to see her animal side needing you as much as she needs to eat and breath.

BE STILL ALL BEINGS AND SHIT YOURSELVES. When at last my benighted eyes were raised to see the glory of the once-hidden globes, I was blasted from my chair by the sheer quivering force of the mighty revelation, all of my clothes instantly catching on fire and turning to ash, my hair growing 8 inches and turning a snowy white, and an enormous erection sprouting from betwixt my legs and curving back to form a circle in honor of the mysterious shape which had visited upon me this most staggering of epiphanies. I opened my mouth, hoping to croak out some paltry expletive to express my astonishment, but from my lips sprang the sound of the Star Wars theme being performed by ten thousand machine guns, accompanied by the full text of Apple's Terms of Service sung by dying angels. I went into a coma and woke up in New South Wales in 1967. I have waited 50 years to write this comment. 50 years with a circledick.

I listened to ”Gucci Gang” by Miami, Florida based Cuban-American rapper Lil Pump.  I must say, as an individual who has no fondness in his heart for the music known to the youth as ”hip-hop” or ”rap”, I discovered distinct creativity in the lyric ”lil pump still sell that meth”.  Lil Pump’s ”flow” and ”bars” reveal a specific style and quality not found in rappers until Pump’s first song was released to Soundcloud in 2016.  I have not found such quality in rappers such as Kanye West or Kendrick Lamar.  Pump, however, possesses certain talent, but lacks the widespread popularity—an underdog in the ”rap game”.

Hide will meet Kanou, who will turn Hide into a second Dragon maggot. Hidragon will then go and fight Kaneki in a Godzilla: Destroy All Monsters-esque showdown, destroying half of Tokyo and throwing buildings and shit.

Then, Hide will finally win against Kaneki and then they will kiss. Kaneki's hormones will help him produce thousands of construction workers from his Dragon body, and those workers will rebuild Tokyo. He will also revive everyone, including Arima, who will slit his throat again upon seeing Hideki.

Then, TouKen will get divorced cause Touka's been through too much shit, and Kaneki and Hide will get married. The marriage will unify Human and Ghoulkind, and the CCG and Ghouls will be totally chill.

Fastforward 15 years, and Hide and Kaneki have adopted a kid who they named Baneki. Baneki, TouKen's kid, Furuta and Rize's 101 kids, and friends will go on fun adventures, and Baneki will strive to become the Hoka-I mean, chief of the CCG.

google it. hows it feel to have someone in your house making you look like a homosexual? Must suck. You're losing this exchange btw. But that shouldn't be too hard for you to swallow since you're used to large tranny penises in your throat. Also post as many replies as you want and I'll systemically make you look like an inbred in one reply because I'm that good.

Let’s face it: girls are kinda hard to put up with.


I mean, just think about it! They have all these… these *things*, you know? Stuff like “personalities” and “tastes” and… and “opinions”! I mean, who has the time to deal with that? I have a giant boner pretty much 24/7 and hearing an attractive woman talk *(and who the fuck wants to hear women talk anyways?)* when she could be doing something else – with her mouth, to my dick – is frankly torture. And ever since the well-meaning total retards of the world decided that you can’t, in fact, keep a girl pregnant, barefoot, and tied to the kitchen courtesy of a ball and chain (because they have “rights” or whatever), this source of frustration has become somewhat hard to avoid.


So, what’s a good, decent man like myself to do?


Well, I thought about it, and I concluded that turning bitches into mindless cock sleeves is a great start!


You see, if what my Chinese cartoons and comics have taught me is true (and I have no reason to doubt it), women’s minds are directly related to the state of their pussy. Namely, each woman has a certain threshold for how much dick she can take in a certain amount of time. Exceed the threshold, and her true slut personality bursts to the surface and takes over; she becomes only a human sex toy, obsessed with being impregnated. Who doesn’t like that?


I mean, of course, the total breakdown of her mental faculties may be a bit difficult to manage, but if you do things right, you can end up with girls with enough personality to make you a sandwich on command in-between bouts of fucking, and that’s really more than good enough! And hell, if you do completely ruin her and she becomes nothing more than a drooling human cum-dumpster, she still beats your average empowered feminist woman in pretty much every category that matters, up to and including cognitive ability.

To be fair, you have to have a very high IQ to understand Diners Drive-Ins And Dives. The humor is extremely tasty, and without a solid grasp of triple-decker sandwiches, most of the jokes will go over a typical viewer's head. There's also Fieri's exuberant outlook, which is deftly woven into his characterisation - his personal philosophy draws heavily from BBQ cookbooks, for instance. The fans understand this stuff; they have the right kind of taste buds to truly appreciate the depths of these flavors, to realize that they're not just delicious- they say something deep about LIFE. As a consequence people who dislike Triple D truly ARE idiots- of course they wouldn't appreciate, for instance, the humour in Fieri's slammin' catchphrase "Welcome to FlavorTown," which itself is a cryptic reference to Paula Dean's American epic Cookin' With Paula. I'm drooling right now just imagining one of those barbecue biddletumps scratching their rhubarbs in confusion as Guy Fieri's genius unfolds itself on their big paper plates. What fools... how I pity them. 🍔 And yes by the way, I DO have a Guy Fieri tattoo. And no, you cannot see it. It's for the home-cooked down-south sauce-slathered flavor-lathered timeless meals' eyes only- And even they have to demonstrate that they're within 5 flavor points of my own succulent dishes (preferably lower) beforehand.

In Congress, July 4, 1776.

The unanimous Declaration of the thirteen united States of America, When in the Course of human events, it becomes necessary for one people to dissolve the political bands which have connected them with another, and to assume among the powers of the earth, the separate and equal station to which the Laws of Nature and of Nature's God entitle them, a decent respect to the opinions of mankind requires that they should declare the causes which impel them to the separation.

We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness.--That to secure these rights, Governments are instituted among Men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed, --That whenever any Form of Government becomes destructive of these ends, it is the Right of the People to alter or to abolish it, and to institute new Government, laying its foundation on such principles and organizing its powers in such form, as to them shall seem most likely to effect their Safety and Happiness. Prudence, indeed, will dictate that Governments long established should not be changed for light and transient causes; and accordingly all experience hath shewn, that mankind are more disposed to suffer, while evils are sufferable, than to right themselves by abolishing the forms to which they are accustomed. But when a long train of abuses and usurpations, pursuing invariably the same Object evinces a design to reduce them under absolute Despotism, it is their right, it is their duty, to throw off such Government, and to provide new Guards for their future security.--Such has been the patient sufferance of these Colonies; and such is now the necessity which constrains them to alter their former Systems of Government. The history of the present King of Great Britain is a history of repeated injuries and usurpations, all having in direct object the establishment of an absolute Tyranny over these States. To prove this, let Facts be submitted to a candid world.

He has refused his Assent to Laws, the most wholesome and necessary for the public good.

He has forbidden his Governors to pass Laws of immediate and pressing importance, unless suspended in their operation till his Assent should be obtained; and when so suspended, he has utterly neglected to attend to them.

He has refused to pass other Laws for the accommodation of large districts of people, unless those people would relinquish the right of Representation in the Legislature, a right inestimable to them and formidable to tyrants only.

He has called together legislative bodies at places unusual, uncomfortable, and distant from the depository of their public Records, for the sole purpose of fatiguing them into compliance with his measures.

He has dissolved Representative Houses repeatedly, for opposing with manly firmness his invasions on the rights of the people.

He has refused for a long time, after such dissolutions, to cause others to be elected; whereby the Legislative powers, incapable of Annihilation, have returned to the People at large for their exercise; the State remaining in the mean time exposed to all the dangers of invasion from without, and convulsions within.

He has endeavoured to prevent the population of these States; for that purpose obstructing the Laws for Naturalization of Foreigners; refusing to pass others to encourage their migrations hither, and raising the conditions of new Appropriations of Lands.

He has obstructed the Administration of Justice, by refusing his Assent to Laws for establishing Judiciary powers.

He has made Judges dependent on his Will alone, for the tenure of their offices, and the amount and payment of their salaries.

He has erected a multitude of New Offices, and sent hither swarms of Officers to harrass our people, and eat out their substance.

He has kept among us, in times of peace, Standing Armies without the Consent of our legislatures.

He has affected to render the Military independent of and superior to the Civil power.

He has combined with others to subject us to a jurisdiction foreign to our constitution, and unacknowledged by our laws; giving his Assent to their Acts of pretended Legislation:

For Quartering large bodies of armed troops among us:

For protecting them, by a mock Trial, from punishment for any Murders which they should commit on the Inhabitants of these States:

For cutting off our Trade with all parts of the world:

For imposing Taxes on us without our Consent:

For depriving us in many cases, of the benefits of Trial by Jury:

For transporting us beyond Seas to be tried for pretended offences

For abolishing the free System of English Laws in a neighbouring Province, establishing therein an Arbitrary government, and enlarging its Boundaries so as to render it at once an example and fit instrument for introducing the same absolute rule into these Colonies:

For taking away our Charters, abolishing our most valuable Laws, and altering fundamentally the Forms of our Governments:

For suspending our own Legislatures, and declaring themselves invested with power to legislate for us in all cases whatsoever.

He has abdicated Government here, by declaring us out of his Protection and waging War against us.

He has plundered our seas, ravaged our Coasts, burnt our towns, and destroyed the lives of our people.

He is at this time transporting large Armies of foreign Mercenaries to compleat the works of death, desolation and tyranny, already begun with circumstances of Cruelty & perfidy scarcely paralleled in the most barbarous ages, and totally unworthy the Head of a civilized nation.

He has constrained our fellow Citizens taken Captive on the high Seas to bear Arms against their Country, to become the executioners of their friends and Brethren, or to fall themselves by their Hands.

He has excited domestic insurrections amongst us, and has endeavoured to bring on the inhabitants of our frontiers, the merciless Indian Savages, whose known rule of warfare, is an undistinguished destruction of all ages, sexes and conditions.

In every stage of these Oppressions We have Petitioned for Redress in the most humble terms: Our repeated Petitions have been answered only by repeated injury. A Prince whose character is thus marked by every act which may define a Tyrant, is unfit to be the ruler of a free people.

Nor have We been wanting in attentions to our Brittish brethren. We have warned them from time to time of attempts by their legislature to extend an unwarrantable jurisdiction over us. We have reminded them of the circumstances of our emigration and settlement here. We have appealed to their native justice and magnanimity, and we have conjured them by the ties of our common kindred to disavow these usurpations, which, would inevitably interrupt our connections and correspondence. They too have been deaf to the voice of justice and of consanguinity. We must, therefore, acquiesce in the necessity, which denounces our Separation, and hold them, as we hold the rest of mankind, Enemies in War, in Peace Friends.

We, therefore, the Representatives of the united States of America, in General Congress, Assembled, appealing to the Supreme Judge of the world for the rectitude of our intentions, do, in the Name, and by Authority of the good People of these Colonies, solemnly publish and declare, That these United Colonies are, and of Right ought to be Free and Independent States; that they are Absolved from all Allegiance to the British Crown, and that all political connection between them and the State of Great Britain, is and ought to be totally dissolved; and that as Free and Independent States, they have full Power to levy War, conclude Peace, contract Alliances, establish Commerce, and to do all other Acts and Things which Independent States may of right do. And for the support of this Declaration, with a firm reliance on the protection of divine Providence, we mutually pledge to each other our Lives, our Fortunes and our sacred Honor.

“Even with all of that, it doesn't pretend to have all the answers, but its presence acknowledges that it's a problem that any person of faith has to wrestle with.”
I grew up as a reformed Presbyterian and didn’t leave the faith until after my junior year at a Christian college. The part I’m quoting above is the official narrative that any Christian will use, and is a clue to what is actually occurring: Job isn’t an attempt by Christians (or Jews) to deal with the difficult questions, but rather a rhetorical “move” or polemic used to lend intellectual legitimacy to ideas that have no intellectual legitimacy. The problem of evil, and the contradictions presented in Job, are logically irreconcilable. If one is invested in truly grappling with difficult ideas, one has to be willing to change his mind about his conclusions in the face of logical contradictions. What is happening in Job is the opposite. Humans frequently employ a rhetorical tactic to legitimize an irrational belief. You can see it used every day: tell someone you’ve struggled deeply with apparent contradiction, maybe even engage a lengthy discussion about it; then, when you’re finished, reassert your irrational conclusions. This will make it appear, to both your conscience and to others, as though your irrational conclusions have gained in legitimacy by virtue of still existing even after you “struggled” and “grappled” with “the difficult questions. Job isn’t a serious grappling with the issue because serious intellectual grappling involves having the courage to accept logical rebuttals of irrational claims and then face the reality that emerges. The book of Job isn’t meant to help believers grapple with difficult truths. Rather it’s a subtle rhetorical polemic designed to make one feel he has grappled with truth despite maintaining an irrational belief. In other words, it’s about having your cake and eating it, too.
Christians don’t read Job to be challenged by reason and the logical contradictions of their beliefs. Nobody reads Job prior to a break with the faith. They read it for the same reason they get flu shots. Christians don’t lose their faith reading Job, but become innoculated against reason, training themselves to consider the irrationality of their ideas, and then pat themselves on the back for their continued belief and perceived intellectual street cred.
To assume Job is about grappling with difficult truths is to accept precisely the narrative it’s feeding you...which is its power. But it is, and remains, a book whose authorship was fundamentally invested and dependent upon worshiping the irrationality it claims to grapple with. Job is pseudo-intellectual musing meant to create a barrier between rational thought and its consequences. It was written by zealots to justify unreason.

You know, sometimes I think back to the movie “Click” with Adam Sandler. I remember the dramatic scenes where Sandler’s father dies and he constantly skips forward through time, missing his entire life before his very eyes. I tear up every time his death scene plays because of the sheer emotion in the scene. I get sad when he passes out at his daughter’s wedding during his and his wife’s song Linger by the Cranberries. I just think, “Yeah. That would’ve been a great movie if the tone remained consistent.” But no. Adam Sandler once again took a BIG STEAMING SHIT on his career by attempting another half assed “comedy”. Are you kidding me? Had this movie have been a solely dramatic movie, it would have had an OSCAR. I almost feel sorry for Christopher Walken appearing in this sad pathetic excuse for a movie but this movie is so unmentioned that Walken has gone back to his fantastic roles as always. As for Sandler, I hope you’re reading this, because I hope you stop making shit comedies and let your genuine creativity shine. Until then, FUCK YOU Sandler.

I've been thing about quantum mechanics cause I can. I already figured out how teleportation is possible without kill the living being. Now I'm thing. How can the past determin the future if the past already happen? It doesn't work. The future has to determine the past. For example, in order for a rock to be somewhere you have to place it there first. If you go in the future and put a rock somewhere and then go back in time, the rock will be where you put it because it's there in the future. Sorry, I'm really smart. When I think freely I tend to shatter reality. :/

Imagine your working at a fast food place, tending to a customer, it's your one dream to meet your hero, Austin Powers,nothing out of the ordinary. Slowly you start to hear the "Austin Powers theme song" slowly start to get louder and louder. Just before the music really kicks in, several hundred Austin Powers impersonators bust through the front door, constantly quoting the films. As they run through the restaurant, a sudden fear rushes through you. The ones in the front of the mob leap over the counter. One grabs your apron. With a quick, "Oh behave!" He rips off you're work attire. It's clear what they're here for, to fulfill their pathological need to shag. You swiftly run to the back of the establishment. The theme song growing louder behind you. You come to the back door. Turning around you see the crowd of Austins draw closer with a "smashing, baby!" They destroy the restaurant as they blow through. You open the back door, locking it behind you. You run a solid 20 feet before realizing you're safe. The patrons may not have met the same pleasant fate.as you. As you're catching your breath, you hear them pounding on the door. You're paralyzed by fear as the pounding grows louder. Finally the pounding stops, despite this, fear over comes your body. The silence is broken by a yell of a "Judo Chop!" The door swings open the crowd of Austin Powers' flood the door along with one confused man dressed as shrek. At this time you realize this is no dream, but a nightmare.

Does watching an episode of Rick and Morty make you lose your virginity?" To answer your question, first, let's discuss what is virginity. What IS virginity? Let's use the colloquial definition of virginity, that is "A virgin is someone who has not rubbed their private parts on someone else's private parts for some duration of time". Notice that you do not actually have to ejaculate, or reach orgasm, to lose your virginity. In order to lose your virginity you simply need to experience sex, which is the rubbing of genitals together, for some duration of time. Great, so we know what it means to be a virgin, and what it means to lose your virginity. There is one thing you may not have noticed about this definition, however, and that is the duration of time that you must rub your privates against another person's privates in order to lose your virginity. Is a man who sticks his dick into a woman still a virgin if he cums immediately? No, that is silly. He has lost his virginity to that woman. Let's take this a bit further, is a man whose dick only grazes the vagina's entrance before cumming into it still a virgin? No, he is not, despite not even being able to feel the sexual contact. If that man's dick had not actually grazed the entrance to the vagina but only came infinitely close to touching it, well, he still would have experienced the same thing because in either situation he would have not felt it. Thus, we use deductive reasoning to determine that, while one must rub one's genitals against another's to lose one's virginity, this is the equivalent to one not rubbing his genitals against another's; that is to say, therefore, that one does not have to touch genital's with another to lose one's virginity. If one's imagination is able to offer a convincing enough experience, then one has lost their virginity outside of their imagination whilst only experiencing sex in their imagination. So let's restate our definition of virginity. Taking the no-touch requirement we explored before into consideration. Virgin - "a virgin is someone who has not experienced sex, whether that be physical or convincing imagined sex". Someone who has lost their virginity - "someone who has experienced sex, or has experienced convincing imaginary sex". If convincing imaginary sex is in effect the equivalent to physical sex, let us define the term "effective sex". Effective sex - "a life-changing experience, physical or mental, real or imagined, that causes one's identity to change in the sense that they no longer feel that the term 'virgin' and all the things associated with it can be used as an accurate descriptor of them anymore". Ah! Allow me to take a short, mental break after such a rigorous exploration of virginity. We will finish our thoughts afterwards. ... Let's get back to it, fellow intellectuals! As Albert Einstein once said, no time like the present! Of course, Einstein's work (which many have said is merely a semantics-based interpretation of the work of other scientists who do not receive the name recognition he does) would later lead to the bombing of millions of innocent Japanese civilians. Burning women and children alive in their homes while their husbands were overseas fighting. If they had been with them at the time, however, they still would not have been able to defend against the bomb. Ba! Imagine, a Japanese army clanging their swords up against an atom bomb in a desperate attempt to defeat it. Ahahahahaha, it is quite humorous to conjure up such an image in one's mind, although it would be quite tragic to witness it. Metaphorically, I believe that intellectual exploration is as influential as Einstein (a Jewish man, by the way, which absolutely has nothing to do with his name recognition), but in a peaceful, less abrasive way. Like an atom bomb, a good intellectual argument is unable to be countered, no matter how much manpower or courage one possesses. So the initial question which was proposed was whether or not watching an episode of Rick and Morty can be considered the equivalent to losing your virginity in the time-tested way of rubbing ones genitals against another's genitals until ejaculation or alternatively orgasm has been achieved. Well, from our prior deconstruction of virginity, we know that virginity is lost by participating in effective sex. Effective sex - "a life-changing experience, physical or mental, real or imagined, that causes ones identity to change in the sense that they no longer feel that the term 'virgin' and all things associated with it can be used as an accurate descriptor of them anymore". Well, to the question "Can watching an episode of Rick and Morty be considered losing your virginity?", I boldly answer YES - yes, of course it can! Think about it, when you watch Rick and Morty, how does it make you feel? For an intellectual, Rick and Morty touches them in ways normal media does not. It shatters their ego as an intellectual into pieces, alas not destroying it in its entirety, only with the most honest intentions of allowing them to deconstruct it in an even more intellectually robust form. Thus, if they were virgins prior to the viewing of said episode of Rick and Morty, the element of their ego, their identity that tells them "yes, you identify as a virgin" is now destroyed. Thus, for an intellectual, watching an episode of Rick and Morty is the equivalent to losing said intellectual's virginity. HOWEVER, I should note, that for a pleb, watching an episode of Rick and Morty will not have the same effect as he will not be able to truly understand it, and therefore his ego will not be shattered, as he will not even be able to comprehend the intellectualism the show presents in its true form. He may laugh, me may chuckle, but the intellectualism will be totally lost on him. Hell, he may even feel as if he understood it for its intellectual proposals. Perhaps he will tell people at parties that he has lost his virginity via Rick and Morty, but the pleb will know, and the people will know, if not too polite to call him out, that he has not truly lost his virginity. Only the intellectual's virginity is lost via watching an episode of Rick and Morty. I hereby conclude from this rigorous intellectual exploration of the question "Does watching an episode of Rick and Morty cause you to lose your virginity?" to be answerable, and that answer is "YES! - If you are an intellectual, that is"﻿

Uhm, ok. Wow. Self-admitted shitpostcomment. What was the point of this comment exactly? I mean, I get it. You like his post and agree. You realized something incredible! Mindblowing. And you want to express that. I've had those times as well... let's face it, it's a normal form of communication. But, your inane comment simply adds nothing of value to the conversation. What does agreeing with him do? Does it make you feel old to be part of the team? Does it make you happy to say that you're following his thought patterns? Is this really what you want out of Life?

I think you can do better, son. That's why I'm going to use the parental approach, and give you a downvote. Not because I dislike you. But because I want to teach you this very valuable lesson.

Contribute to conversation - to society, my friend. Don't be a follower, be a leader. Even if it means you get downteachered as I'm fairly certain I will (but I'm brave and wise enough to comprehend the ill and negligible value of internet points, so that's irrelevant).

May the force be with you, and live stronk and Casper, OP Juan Canopy.

You don't need to be a chad to find affection from the opposite sex. You just need to care about yourself.
Imagine if you ran a restaurant and didn't care about the quality of the food. You just said "eh whatever" and sold rotting, stale produce with your meals. You should not be surprised if the customers don't come. Nobody owes you their business. From the consumer's perspective, all they want is a nice meal. If you're not offering one, they're not going to buy. They don't have any obligation to share their business around to ensure that all restaurants have customers. They are looking out for themselves, and they will continue to simply eat where they like the food.
You have to care about what you're selling before you can find a buyer.
Now the good news is, unlike a restaurant, you only need one customer. This is a lot easier to attain than a profitable business.
But you have to care about what you're selling.
If you don't exercise, if you eat like garbage, if you don't have any interesting hobbies or passions, then why would anyone want to be a customer?
You don't need to like football. You don't need to have a six pack. You don't need to have been born with Ryan Gosling's face. You...the you that's reading this...already have everything you need to be loved. You just need to love yourself first before anyone else will see you as worth loving.
Replace sugary drinks with water. Walk or cycle when you go somewhere that's walking or cycling distance. Shower and shave every couple days. Buy clothes that fit you.
Find a community of people in your area that shares an interest or hobby with you and go meet them irl. It doesn't matter if it's all dudes, this is about you feeling good about yourself.
If you do these things you'll start to notice yourself feeling good about yourself. It happens almost magically. Get your blood flowing and exercise your social muscles and the endorphins will follow.
If you just keep doing these things, eventually you will encounter someone who sees in you what you see in yourself.
But if all you see in yourself is someone who's getting screwed over and is sad and lonely, why do you expect anyone else to see something different?

"Rick and Morty"? Only a plebeian worm would engage in viewing broadcasts of such a sad and idiotic show. Unlike you low IQ apes, I please my optical sensors with only the finest of entertainment. I'll bet that you're inquiring as to what source of entertainment I am referring to. Although I don't expect you to comprehend it, the television show in question is "Young Sheldon". You see, the humor is vastly superior to that of "Rick and Morty". First of all "Rick and Morty" relies heavily on improvisional comedy, while the intellectual humor of "Young Sheldon" is scripted and well thought out before being presented to an audience. Second of all "Rick and Morty" is extremely unfaithful to its source material (Back to the Future, for you simpletons) while "Young Sheldon" is just as good if not better than watching "The Big Bang Theory". I could go on and on about how "Rick and Morty" is vastly inferior to "Young Sheldon" but I highly doubt that you have the mental capability to process such logic. So if you'll excuse me, I'm going to pour a glass of brandy whilst I redigest the latest episode of "Young Sheldon" so I can make an entry about it to the "Young Sheldon" wikia. Hopefully, I can forget about ever having the displeasure of interacting with you. Sigh... How tedious.

In regards to my last post, I'd like to clear up a few things. First of all, I am in high school. High schoolers watch porn, sometimes furry porn. I don't personally watch furry porn, but the overexaggerated features (breasts, vaginas, penises) are good for drawing reference for me. I'm an artist who draws naked women a lot in a pornographic style. Do people in this group think it's better to criticize someone's untrue age rather than ask questions? I was trying to be funny, but it clearly didn't come across that way. I apologize for any inconvenience or misunderstandings. Lastly, if you can't be kind to others, maybe you need a break from other people. I pity you. Thank you for taking the time to read this.

Ahem. There is literally no historical evidence that the Ark of the Bible was ever built or existed. The Titanic was doomed not because it was structurally unsound, but because of human operational error.

So, a better metaphor is the Wright Flyer was built by amateurs, the De Havilland Comet was built by professionals.

(The Comet was the world’s first commercial jetliner that kept breaking up in flight because of fatigue concentrations at the corners of its truly square windows, which is why all commercial jetliners have rounded windows now.)

To be fair, you have to have a very high IQ to understand OP's legal theory. The tactic is extremely subtle, and without a solid grasp of case law and doctrine most of the jokes will go over a typical viewer’s head. There’s also the OP's narcissistic outlook, which is deftly woven into his arguments - his personal philosophy draws heavily from Oliver Wendell Holmes literature, for instance. The best lawyers understand this stuff; they have the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate the depths of these arguments, to realise that they’re not just innovative - they say something deep about LAW. As a consequence people who dislike OP truly ARE idiots - of course they wouldn’t appreciate, for instance, the argument in OP’s existential catchphrase “I have devised a theoretical legal doctrine that is very promising,” which itself is a cryptic reference to Marshall's epic Marbury v. Madison. I’m smirking right now just imagining one of those addlepated simpletons scratching their heads in confusion as OP’s genius wit unfolds itself on their screens. What fools.. how I pity them.


And yes, by the way, i DO have a law degree. And no, you cannot see it. It’s for the ladies’ eyes only - and even then they have to demonstrate that they’re within 5 IQ points of my own (preferably lower) beforehand. Nothin personnel kid

If you think about, toothbrushes have the worse abuse. The toothbrush is getting used twice a day every day, with only some cleaning, while the toilet paper has not yet been used. Toilet paper is clean, and it's only possible abuse is the existential dread of being used and then dirtied in sewers for the rest of its life. Kinda like all of us.

Haha road accidents. What a great joke you just made about road accidents. In fact, I know so much about it that I can easily deconstruct it’s flows and show why playing in traffic is the perfect joke, without ever have taken an road safety class. With my high IQ of 230 I can watch Just one video and know every facet of road accidents. It is truly an ideal problem that could never be applied in doe adverts because the goverment is shit. I’m sure if I put my mind to it I could probably reinvent road safety into an actual serious and important topic that’s viable in the your subject choices. Too bad I have ADD and can’t focus on more than one thing at a time or I would take a break from reconstructing NASA’s Apollo 11 rocket and reconstruct road safety adverts. Speaking of rockets, I only took one physics class and already understand the quantum mechanical functionings of the universe. I’m actually in the process of rewriting string theory. But I digress, I must compliment you on that joke regarding road accidents, because even if you totally misunderstood the problems of road accidents, making your joke nonsensical, it still made me chuckle lightly. Good job, it’s not often that I laugh to due to sophisticated and philosophical sense of humor and nihilistic outlooks. After all, I watch Rick and morty. Anyway, congratulations on your joke, I do hope you take time to brush up on your grammar and knowledge of road accidents though.

To be fair, you have to have a very high IQ to understand diving. The buoyancy is extremely subtle, and without a solid grasp of trim most of the divers will float over a typical person’s head. There’s also diving’s nihilistic outlook, which is deftly woven into its characterisation- diving draws heavily from Cousteau, for instance. The divers understand this stuff; they have the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate the trim required to dive well, to realise that PADI courses aren't just fun- they make you a better diver. As a consequence people who dislike diving truly ARE idiots- of course they wouldn’t appreciate, for instance, the humor in diving’s existential catchphrase “I hate snorkels,” which itself is a cryptic reference to their uselessness. I’m smirking right now just imagining one of those addlepated simpletons scratching their heads in confusion as they try to read dive tables. What fools.. how I pity them. joy

These poor people have been held down by slavery for so many decades and centuries, it'll be at least 75 years before they start experimenting with false-flag accusations like their modern poor, obese white counterparts.

why does genji's reflect make me look retarded 99% of the time? i watched genji's play of the game and it showed me as bastion just holding left click into the distance and then genji jumped straight in, reflected like 100 bullets and then i sat there bent over the desk while he shoved his dragon up my exhaust. what actually happened was that i was tearing down orisa's shield and the genji just walked up with his ult, reflected like 20 bullets and killed me with a sword swing after i had already taken a load of damage from the orisa who's shield i was trying to kill. the other time was in the same game where i ulted and shot far enough to the left of the genji where it would have exploded on the ground and dealt splash damage but no, the reflect hitbox is wider than a rein shield so it of course came back and killed me. checking the killcam showed that i apparently shot it directly below him, even though it was a good 5m to the left of him.

True story: One of my annoying coworkers had been bragging that she met Aaron Judge at a party and had been hanging out with him. Nobody believed her. She was pretty and I guess somewhat well connected, but come on, she couldn't even tell you what "doubleplay" meant. Had to be bullshit, right?

Well last Christmas we had an office party and rumor was that she was going to bring him. When I got there, there was no sign of her though and everyone was kind of poking fun of her usual bullshit. As usually happens to me in social situations, I eventually get too anxious and have to find a quiet place to recharge in. I duck into my boss’s office and turn on the lights and almost had a fucking heart attack. FUCKING AARON JUDGE IS IN THE ROOM SITTING ON THE PHOTOCOPIER MAKING PHOTOCOPIES OF HIS ASS. Scattered all around the room were dozens of photocopies of his bare derriere. He didn’t even acknowledge my presence with embarrassment or cover up. He just looked me dead in the eyes, reached over and pressed the print button again.

Fucking Aaron Judge.

I was never into politics before this year. One of my college professors last summer would spend 15 minutes every day talking shit about Trump and how much he hated him. He would have this smug look on his face while talking about how nobody takes Trump seriously because he's a retarded asshole, he has no chance at winning, the Republicans are all embarrassed of him, he doesn't know how to read, etc. I was fooled by all of the brainwashing until one day a FB post caught my attention. It was a meme pointing out that Trump's politics has been consistent for the past 30 years, there was a video of it too. Then I started watching his debates out of curiosity and I got redpilled. Reading the leaked emails from Wikileaks did a lot to help as well. I wish I could've seen my professor's reaction to GEOTUS winning.
Believe me when I say that memes DO have an impact.














$------------------$














God, the cringe...where do I even start?

First and foremost, if you think this is the only show that's ever shown any level of quiet intellectualism buried in a simpler comedic guise, you REALLY need to get out more. It's a common theme amongst writers in a LOT of shows.

Second, comedy is an art, and art is SUBJECTIVE. Not everyone is going to like the same jokes, regardless of intellect. To say that everyone that disagrees with your OPINION is stupid only shows how lacking you really are in your own intelligence.

Third, you really DON'T need to "have a very high lQ" to enjoy this show. Some education may help get references, but it's really not required to enjoy the show. Again, pretty common theme amongst a lot of writers.

Finally, if you think you can impress 'the ladies' with a tattoo of a cartoon and an over inflated ego based on our sad and clear misunderstanding of your lQ, you're really setting yourself up for failure. Which, again, only further illustrates a deep lack of the intellect you seem to believe you Lord over the world.

In short, there's nothing more dangerous than an idiot that believes he's smart. So please be less of a danger to those around you.

The topic of if traps are gay is complex on the surface, but I have cracked the issue- traps are only 50% gay, sand here’s why. Firstly, a trap is defined as a male who disguises as a female in order to trick others into thinking they are about to have intercourse with a female. While the target is usually male, this does not make this gay, as the man goes in expecting straight sex. This cancels out the homo intentions of the trap, resulting in being only 50% gay. Similarly, a trap and a female getting together is also the same, albeit with opposite expectations in the relationship (female expects homosexual sex but gets heterosexual sex). Additionally, if two traps go at each other without knowing the other’s a trap, both go in expecting a heterosexual intercourse but have gay intercourse, cancelling out and making it 50% gay. If one or both of the traps are figured out, this situations no longer applies and they no longer are traps, so it does not change this. In conclusion, traps are merely 50% gay, regardless if it is T/M, T/F, or T/T.

Man that's pretty lame of you eh? You have a fair bit of power, not an immense amount, but a little bit, enough to effect how many people think.

People sincerely raise with you their concerns about your behaviour - how you might be abusing your power - and your response is to mock them? What does that say about your character and who you are and what you are about? 

Do you think you can do no wrong? Do you think you are doing good even though people are suggesting you might not be? Do you think it's ok to mock others for their concerns?

Gay marriage is a disservice to the average people as it is to the homosexuals it enables. To enable a community plagued by sexually transmitted diseases, domestic abuse, and a lack of longevity in their relationships by legally validating them is a moral wrong.

I think that pineapples should come in triangles since watermelons grow in squares. It just feels right. Like a spiky triangle is a lot cooler than a smooth cube amiright? I know we cant defy physics yet but if we could this is what I'd do. Imagine how much better shows like psych would be with a pineapple. For example, if they had a triangular pineapple, they could be able to join a concert! They could even make a whole episode off of going to a triangular pineapple farm and catching a robber or thief who was taking all of the pineapples. I don't just want this in my life, I need this. Imagine how much easier they would be to cut, and how much more cool SpongeBob's house would be! I am making an Indiegogo page to support this idea, and I would really appreciate it if you donated

I'm not who you responded to, but I'm assuming they were just opposing the term whore. Whore is a really nasty word for complex cultural reasons; in some ways it has issues similar to racial slurs. It strikes at the core of the age old standard that women are not allowed to be sexual creatures, and that any woman that is will be less than or inferior for the sole fact that she is female and has sex. If course, most people don't think of that when they use that term, but it reminds me of when people say, "they really gypped you on that", completely unaware that is a terrible racial slur against the Romani people (Gypsy). 
There are plenty of insults out there, but whore isn't one I'm ever willing to use (or racial slurs).

Editor is http://www.hemingwayapp.com/

To be fair, you have to have a very high IQ to understand Rick and Morty. The humor is very subtle. Without a solid grasp of theoretical physics, most of the jokes will go over a typical viewer’s head. There’s also Rick’s nihilistic outlook, which is woven into his character. His personal philosophy draws from Narodnaya Volya literature, for instance. The fans understand this stuff. They have the intellectual capacity to appreciate the depths of these jokes. They also realise that it's not only funny, but also says something deep about LIFE. As a consequence, people who dislike Rick & Morty are idiots. Of course, they wouldn’t appreciate, for instance, the humor in Rick’s catchphrase, “Wubba Lubba Dub Dub." This itself is a cryptic reference to Turgenev’s Russian epic, Fathers and Sons. I’m smirking right now, as I imagine one of those simpletons. They scratch their heads in confusion as Dan Harmon’s genius unfolds itself on their screens. What fools.. how I pity them. Yes, by the way, I do have a Rick & Morty tattoo. And no, you cannot see it. It’s for the ladies’ eyes only. Even they have to prove that they’re within 5 IQ points of my own (I prefer lower) beforehand. Nothing personal, kid.

Pryce — great question. I was the recipient of 1,000 hugs from 10,000 lightning bugs for a grand total of 10,000,000 hugs. As the lyrics of the song clearly state, the average layperson would not believe their eyes if 10,000,000 fireflies were to illuminate planet Earth, nor would the average person conclude by natural instinct that 10,000 lightning bugs, acting as a collective group, are capable of embracing a human being 1,000 times without difficulty. By the same token, a gathering of lightning bugs in such vast numbers form a sort of "swarm," and a swarm can collectively surround a human and deliver a "hug" that a single firefly, acting according to the dictates of his own conscience, simply cannot. Consequently, I was embraced 1,000 times by 10,000 luminescent insects.

This may seem inconceivable due to the firefly's soft-shelled body, which is common among all winged beetles within the Lampyridae insect family. Members of the scientific community may be tempted to cast doubt upon the possibility of this exchange due to the immobility of the prothorax and pterothorax, in addition to the elytra protruding outward while a firefly is engaged in mid-flight. However, I can testify to the accuracy of this exchange. I can furthermore add that while each individual hug took place, each firefly participated in the chemical reaction commonly known as bioluminescence in which the enzymes within the firefly, in the presence of oxygen, magnesium ions and ATP, emitted a chemically produced light or "glow" because they were happy to be hugging me.

So he had 2 tests in 1 week, but i didnt know about the 2nd test. So i was in a classroom and everyone else was prepared and had their cheat sheet but i didnt even have one made 😭 my location switched somehow and i found myself in bangor with the test, but I didn’t remember how i got there. Since tests weren’t allowed to leave the room, i was freaking out about how i was going to explain this to Steenberghe!! So i was on the sidewalk outside and said “heh well im just going to use my calculator” and started doing the test right there. As soon as i started punching in a few numbers he descended from the sky, stepped on my test saying “I’ll take all your papers now” and ripped them up and reported me to the university and was probably gonna get kicked out of school

I don't know if it was the pressure of early adult life or the demands of college, but I began to experiment with huge ships in my late teens. I began by looking at huge ship magazines in the basement when my parents weren't around. Then one day, my mom came home early and unexpectedly caught me in the act. Both of my parents were furious. They asked me where I go the magazine from and I said I found it and that I thought it only contained articles on small watercraft. As a result, I started to sneak out at night, telling my parents that I was headed to a friend's house to watch Full House, but in reality, I was in the library, reading up on huge ships. As my career developed, I found an apartment that I could afford and I moved out of my parents’ house. My interest in huge ships only grew. My apartment became a center for trafficking huge ship paraphernalia: model huge ships, pictures, of huge ships; life preserves – you name it. Eventually some neighbors complained and the owner of the apartment building had me evicted. By that time, I was so far gone that I didn’t care and I moved into a hostel. It was the perfect place to continue my pursuit of huge ships. The rent was cheap, drifters came and went, everyone minded their own business, and once in a while a new person would come along with scale models of huge ships in Turkey. We had a lot of wild nights and I was having trouble holding down my job. Eventually got fired.
One day it dawned on me that if I don't get away from huge ships, I'll end up dead. By pure luck, I ran into a fellow who went through the same thing and he recommend Trimmer's book. Between the book and my support group, I made progress and got back on my feet again.
Last night I almost turned left out of the parking lot instead turning right, as I've done routinely for the last 6 months. Turning left would have meant that I was heading to the Port of Baltimore where huge ships are present everywhere: horns blowing, sailors lashing gear to decks, and merchants teasingly gesturing to the gangplanks as they ask passersby if they want to go for a voyage on a great, big, huge ship. I started to imagine the wakes in the bay and the frolicking of tugs as they pull and push these huge ships in and out of the port. There was a burning desire inside of me: my mouth started to salivate; my hands were trembling; and my eyes darted left and right as they searched for an answer. I thought that maybe I could just go to the port and find one or two huge ships and it wouldn't be that big of a deal. Call it a voice in my head, an angel on my shoulder, or Trimmer's book in my glove box, but I turned right and headed home instead. My support group had a meeting last night and I told them about my near stumble. It felt good to tell everyone that I did not fall victim to weakness. I have my beloved support group and my dearest John W. Trimmer to thank for 6 months - huge ship free.

Ok, I've never really been into video games, so can you please explain what you're saying here? Is this like some type of weird life-simulating-game social thing you're acting out with your fellow video gamers here? I mean, I like books, personally (you know, where things that are mentioned actually have an impact on how the story progresses (that's a sign of intelligence on the part of the author because it demonstrates cohesive, forward thinking (and on the reader's behalf if they can figure out these patterns as well (but I suppose it may not be as common with gamers if they're not used to having some plot point or event, etc., progressing the story (but then I can't blame them for their ignorance if they don't have the exposure (I'm pretty fair about this)))))). So can you please explain this? Sorry if this seems intrusive or condescending; I certainly don't mean it that way: I'm just trying to provide my own perspective and understand yours. Thank you in advance.

Natural uranium is 0.711 wt% U-235 and the balance U-238. It is the U-235 that readily fissions. U-238 can fission with higher neutron energies but most often will readily absorb a neutron in a nuclear reactor and become Pu-239, Pu-240, Pu-241, and Pu-242. Pu-239 and Pu-241 are readily fissionable with thermal (low energy neutrons). In US light water reactors the uranium is processed as UF6 (uranium hexafluoride)  and enriched to not more than 5.0 wt% U-235 including tolerances. In a bomb it would be enriched to more than 90 wt% U-235 and it would be pure metal in its final form. In a light water reactor the UF6 is enriched and then converted to U3O8 and then to UO2. U3O8 is known as yellow cake. Plutonium is more sensitive to neutron fissioning by the fast and thermal neutron energy spectrum. As a result it is a better bomb material for the classical atom bomb. In a hydrogen or thermonuclear bomb a fission trigger is used to create a very high temperature using gamma rays from fission to fuse the hydrogen isotopes of deuterium and tritium. Fusion is the mechanism the sun uses to produce energy. Uranium 238 is the most massive naturally occuring isotope on the planet. It has a half life of 1.2 billion years so it is still around. Plutonium 239 only has a half life of 23400 years approximately so it has all decayed away. That is why plutonium and higher mass elements are considered "man made" because they are only produced in a nuclear reactor. More than you want to know I am sure.

Tbh, comments like this are examples of why I hate Reddit.

I mean, ok.

You were respectful in your response, but honestly, did you actually contribute anything to this conversation? What’s the point of this comment? Does it contribute anything to humanity - heck, to anything - in any perceptible manner?

It really is downright awful. When the vast majority of Reddit's content is utter hooey, viewing such blaggadry all the time can only lead to further harm. Honestly, if most of Reddit's posts seem interesting to you, then, my friend, I think you need a serious chiroredditic adjustment! 😅

Not to offend your sensibilities, of course, but I've been on this website for less than one day, and boy oh boy, is there a lot of garbage. And that's considering just what's on the front page, which is supposed to be the epitome of content that we consume from the contemporary, modern World Wide Web.

I was introduced to this website with such high expectations. Lol and behold... I came to disappointment (that wouldn't be the first time I came to disappointment, of course (particularly in my house and bedroom (wait, I know this sounds dirty, but it isn't (it's referring to very personal experiences (but not sexual ones (at least not how the traditional Redditor defines them (granted, I doubt the average Redditor knows much about sexual experiences given what I've seen here today))))))). I, of course, don't want my friends to experience similar disappointment, and thus, vow to ensure I will prevent any ore new people from visiting this website.

Of course, efforts of such gigantic proportions require critical planning and subtle yet powerful execution. I must, therefore, start by fighting the system from within. The mission has begun.

Why are you callin this a 'copypasta?' Have you seen this posted *anywhere* before? Do you think this is some type of joke? I'll have you know that I take this topic matter very seriously. The internet is filled with enough pointless garbage to fill a landmine the size of our own catastrophically magnificent galaxy itself. The last thing I want to see on this glorious website is an the additional stench of disgusting jokes and excess of useless comments which have no bearing on the outcomes of our existence. By the depths of my conscience, I cannot allow it! I hope you understand this.

It is my prerogative to inform the critical masses of this travesty that plagues our minds and our lives. Life shall come and go; death shall eat us alive; but I shall do what I must to prevent that which can be stopped. Somebody has to do it. May as well be me.

Does anyone realize the true meaning behind Rick and Morty? All these pointless memes going around and straight forward interpretations... by straight forward I mean you are only seeing it from the POV of one timeline. I think it's pretty clear Rick is depressed due to an existential crisis, not because of what happened in his life aka one time line. He knows he can change reality by using his portal gun, but he doesn't see the point to it... He realizes that the sole purpose of his universes existence is to entertain us and that it will all cease to exist when the show gets cancelled. Rick is not an emotionless asshole because there are infinite universes... he became indifferent once he realized the purpose of his existence and those who he cares about. He does his best to entertain us, and that is why he takes all these risks, because he knows he is the protagonist and can't die. That is why the machine fucked up when he tried committing suicide... notice it worked for the AIDS infected creature he destroyed across all universes. He wanted to end his own suffering too, but he couldn't. He is forced to keep entertaining us. It's really a dark dark fucking show if you realize what it's really about. I just wish more people would be intelligent enough to get it. Not trying to be elitist or hipster but all these clowns creating retarded off topic memes just reinforces the true theme of this show about how our existence is fucking meaningless.

The Cavs had just fallen short again, this time to the Atlanta Hawks by a score of 117-115. Just a one possession game, JR Smith told himself. But LeBron knew better. So did Wade. Settling for close enough gets you nowhere in the big leagues. So as LeBron stood lathering his muscular frame in the showers of Cleveland Heights, analyzing the missed kick out threes and botched defensive assignments, he realized something. His passive aggressive leadership wasn’t going to win another one for The Land™. 

LeBron walked out of that shower with just a damp towel around his midriff. He scoffed as Windhorst sucked air at the sight of LeBron’s bulge. Windy really wished he could see it, just once. It’d probably net him a front page article. But no. Today was not that day for Brian. LeBron teased the fat white boy as he had done since his day at St. Vincent St. Mary. He had a different goal in mind.

Into Tyronn Lue’s office LeBron strolled. Lue was sliding gummy bears around his oak desk, pretending to plan out defensive assignments in the wake of another poor showing.

LeBron paused for a second before accepting this was only the fourth most bizarre thing he’d seen Lue do this week. How could he forget the time Lue washed his feet in the hot tub LeBron was bathing in.

LeBron stared at the “coach.” Lue looked up, gummy bears still in hand.

“Lue, I been meaning to talk to you.”

“Raymone, I know what this is about.”

“Did you just call me by my middl-“

“Ssh. Let’s just-“

“No, fuck you; bend your fish ass over.”

Without saying another word LeBron dad dicked Tyronn like he hadn’t felt since Iverson.

Ripping through the JC Penny’s suit was easy enough for LeBron’s tight, thick, and solid cock. He’d been practicing on Wade for years.

Lue begged for mercy as tears streamed from his eyes, but LeBron only drove further into the hole. With every inch of his rod in Lue, he whispered into the ear of his “leader.”

“Man, you know it’s all about getting one for The Land™.”

Adding two instances of the numerical value of two to each other produces the sum of four.
Subtracting one from this sum results in the number three.
I have just demonstrated an example of the study of numbers done in a speedy fashion.

On each passing day the individual is located on the solid cube of hard material.
Ignite large organisms of the plant kingdom on fire and slowly inhale the collection of airborne particulates generated from the combustion.

I watch and observe that individual that identifies as the female gender in the area of natural space set aside for human enjoyment.
After taking everything into consideration I conclude that that particular female is an "uckers".

When the distinct inanimate object generated the sound similar to the sound ducks produce, exactly three times.
You, a male human being, were lowering your body quickly so as to hide yourself.

Human individual that chooses to identify himself as "Azsnee", please wait and do not perform any actions for now.
The fellow person of the male sex is the sole owner of the object I refer to as "pumpee".

Other fellow male human being that I own, please also wait a bit and refrain from doing anything.
The other fellow individual possesses a flat disc-shaped item that can fly long distances in the air when thrown with strength and given a spin.

I proceed to lure an entity into a planted device designed to catch it, three consecutive times.
And I do this on the piece of paved land designed to allow large vehicles to be driven on it.
I transport and set into motion the popular breakfast cereal called "Corn Flakes".

I now randomly mention the name of another well known cereal "Rice Krispies".
Just like I instructed the two previous humans, I also advise you, the person of the female sex that belongs to me, that goes by the name of "Whitney", to stand by and remain in readiness.

While on the paved route I am currently creating ten appendages that typically protrude out of the foot of animals that have feet.
I ask you to please enjoy and be fond of my pedal digits.

You, a masculine adult, held the belief that the water in my body had cooled down and changed its physical state to that of a solid.
I visually perceive a physically attractive female human being which causes me to assume an intentionally seductive body position.

If the said female human is not situated on the thing, then I quickly leave the premises as if I turned into an apparition of a dead person that can appear in the world of the living.
I laugh, but you should also direct your gaze towards the body part responsible for the sense of smell that projects above your mouth.

"Could you please repeat what you said?" I say in a loud manner.
"I choose to equate you with the distal tip of the male sexual organ."
Again, I instruct you to direct your eyes downwards towards the central protruding organ of your face, your nose.

The end-to-end distance of your nose is so long that it can be visually compared to a flexible tube that is used to spray water in a garden.
I now proceed to make an attempt at reproducing the sound that said garden hose makes when active, using my mouth.

I ask you to confirm whether you have in fact succeeded in attaining me.
I try to imitate the sound of a sudden gaseous expansion usually caused by a bomb.
The human person is planning to return back to his internal location.

Could you please divulge your honest opinion on whether you do look on with favor to that?
Also could you please declare whether your bodily senses are perceiving that?

I proclaim that you have in fact done already known all along.
I am visually discerning that your superficial muscles are shaking uncontrollably as if you are frightened.
Please do not react in fear as if you have just witnessed an unexpected event, fellow male member of the Homo sapiens species.
You are currently guaranteed to be safe from any harm, the fact of which is typically referred to as being "protected".
But I also like to add another "ed" syllable at the end of this word.
Affirmative?

I now proceed to mimic the sound produced in a violent explosion.
I present the suggestion that both you and I should depart from the place we're currently residing in.
For a second time I reproduce the sound of a fiery explosion.

Exit the vehicle containing four hinged doorways in one quick maneuver while holding a .44 caliber pistol.
The first four integers in the numeral system were all, in fact, in existence.

The temperature of my body is gradually becoming colder while I'm situated in a long roofed passage inside a building.
The male human individual whose gamete conceived you has been living in this world for at least forty-four years.

This same person is still using a modern telecommunications device to contact another human being and request the artistic production of a picture made with pencil and paper.

Please disclose to your male biological parent what I am about to say next.
As soon as said person falls within my visual field.
I will initiate the action of grabbing and quickly rotating horizontally the mandible bone in the lower part of his face.

I order you to retrieve a chocolate bar going by the name "Twix" belonging to the fellow male individual, using physical violence if necessary.
Please also order this same human to visit an establishment where goods are sold for financial profit, again using physical strength when needed.

The person of the female gender that belongs to you is correctly aware that I have full access to the semi-liquid substance that is typically added to a meal to add flavor.
I do not own any tomato-based condiment however.

It is only the same creamy fluid used for savory dishes that I desire.
This preparation is also pure and not cooked or processed in any way.

Now I'm going to reproduce the sound generated in an explosive blast one more time, say a short slang term used to greet someone or call for attention, and utter the non-existent and meaningless word "gah".

The object without a precise designation, often referred to simply as "thing", but which I pronounce without the letter "h", produces a vast array of sounds that I find very difficult to describe using just the English language. Therefore I am instead going to try to mimic the sounds with my own voice while making convincing gestures using my hands, arms and whole body. The sounds vary from those consisting of just one syllable to more complicated ones that require me to move and slide my tongue along the roof of my mouth very quickly and repeatedly. Some of the sounds resemble those caused by bullet-firing weapons while others are similar to explosive detonations. However, some people would say that they are actually unintelligible words and would classify them as gibberish. I have to admit that one of the reasons I am in fact making all these sounds is to produce a humorous effect by intentionally emphasizing the ridiculousness of it all.

I again repeat the fact that you have done already known.
As a unique individual I choose to identify myself using the name "Big Shaq".

Now I proceed to utter multiple monosyllables that start with the letter "y".

I'd like to inform you that there is a process of rapid oxidation of flammable material under way right now, which is releasing a significant amount of heat and light.
This is happening in the small compartment we are currently inside, and I choose to inform you of this exactly three times.

Could you confirm if you do in fact acquire me?
The male individual belonging to the Homo sapiens species has a temperature value which is not so high that it would cause him discomfort.

I explain this fact to the fellow female person by saying, "The male human does not in fact have a high degree of heat."
Again, I repeat the same thing to the same female, "The individual of the male sex is not perceiving a sensation of great bodily heat."

The human being identifying herself as the female gender requested me to remove my thick outer garment from my body.

I replied to her by saying, "Informal term that literally means a very young toddler but is typically used to describe a good looking female human person, the male individual is in fact not feeling as if his internal body temperature has a significantly high value."

I then proceed to shout "The human being of the male sex cannot ever have a high enough temperature that could cause a sensation similar to that of burning, not now or any other time in the future."

I will now say the formal term that describes the bodily process wherein fluid is produced by sweat glands in the skin of most mammals and is then left to evaporate, with the result of heat being dissipated off the animal's body.
I have also decided to add the slang term "ting" right after.

Next, I will mention the name of the brand "Lynx" that, among other products, manufactures several types of deodorants which are used to cut down on the unpleasant body odors that can be caused by excessive sweating.
I will also say the English word that describes a change which is a result of a previously performed action.

God, having a child is really like clicking the randomise button during character creation. No egg or sperm is ever going to have the same genetic make up, it gets a different and unique combo of your parent's genes every time, and then the sperm and egg combine together for more diversity. Like, it feels like popping a loot box. What are you going to get? Is it going to be the Summer Games Widow Skin or is it going to be 3 sprays and a Junkrat voiceline? Knowing my luck I'll get duplicate trash with autism and a recessive disease that makes them incapable of looking after themselves.

I was the top ifunny profile in my sub bracket and 2nd over all this week and you were what? I know you didn’t do better than me so I don’t think you’re in any position to tell me that you little shit

The mods have slowly been turning this sub into shit over time. I still remember the height of this sub when every meme was edgy or an inside joke, and when people were allowed to ask for upvotes and there was no overused mods are fags joke. Your constant removal of posts has allowed for zero change in the meta, making the whole sub normie trash for a long period of time. For a sub that’s supposed to be big a free speech, it’s kind of ironic that everyone lets you guys choose what classified as hate speech, normie trash, or a shitpost. I swear to god this sub will turn into a second 9gag by 2019. Oh yeah, your bot is also annoying as fuck

As a lesbian, I disagree. I went into vegetarianism for the long term because I understood the deleterious effects that humans have on poor, living, breathing, suffering animals. I think that anyone who is not aware of this is with uneducated or willfully ignorant. The latter being far worse, of course, as that means they don’t care about animals (#AnimalLivesMatter), and thus should be looked down upon and treated worse than humans treat animals. I fully advocate the captivity, mental, physical, and emotional torture, near-death starvation, and eventual euthanasia (after a very long time, of course) of such subhumans.
That’s my personal opinion and I hope that Reddit will be mature enough to respect it (although I greatly doubt it because Reddit is full of obese meateaters).

This song gave great meaning into my life. Lil pumps lyrics are nothing less of a genuine life lesson. People dont understand lil pumps story behind the lyrics. So i will do a lyric break down.

"Gucci gang, gucci gang, gucci gang, gucci gang (gucci gang)
Gucci gang, gucci gang, gucci gang, gucci gang (gucci gang)"

Lil pump is telling his target audience that his gang is indeed called gucci gang.
He says this in order to set the tone for the rest of the song and will show what his gang is all about.

"Spend three racks on a new chain (yuh)
My bih luh do cocaine, ooh (ooh)"

Lil pump is explaining that his gang can in fact afford a chain that is $3,000. Lil pump is being humble and showing that even if he is rich, he will still pay money for a cheap chain. On the line: "my bih luh do cocaine, ooh (ooh)" Lil pump is alluding to the fact that his "bih" is on so much cocaine that she can barely speak which is why he says "bih" and "luh" instead of "bitch" and "love".

"I fuh a bih l, i forgot her name (brr, yuh)
I can't buy a bitch no wedding ring (ooh)
Rather go and buy balmains"

Lil pump is trying to say that he is not loyal at all and is trying to lower the chance of him getting a real girlfriend ever. All lil pump wants to do is fuck alot of women and try and avoid any std's.

"My lean cost more than your rent, ooh (it do)"

Lil pump is saying that he is willing to waste a large amount of money for drugs. Showing his more emotional side as he needs these drugs to get over that he failed school. The ad-lib helps the listener under stand that it actually does cost more than your rent.

"Me and my grandma take meds, ooh (huh?)"

Lil pump again is returning to his emotional side saying that his grandma is in fact a vegetable and she needs meds to survive. This makes lil pump very depressed so he aswell needs to take xanax for his depression.

"Fuck your airline fuck your company (fuck it)"

Lil pump was kicked off a plane just because he was screaming eskitit and somehow being "obnoxious" on the plane. I still dont know why he was kicked off. The only person that matters in the world is lil pump, who cares if people cant sleep or relax on a 24 hour flight.

"They kicked me out the plane off a percocet (brr)
Now lil pump flyin' private jet (yuh)
Everybody scream, "fuck westjet" (fuck em)"

Lil pump is alluding that he was kicked off the plane for using an illegal substance. This is entirely westjets fault. They should have either gave everyone drugs or kicked them all off except lil pump.

Thank you for reading and i hope you appreciate lil pumps artistry alot more now.﻿

It was common knowledge at this point that Ken was allergic to bees. And even though he denied it multiple times, he was also very scared of them. He always thought that they had it out for him. The bees didn't care for him much so he didn't really have to worry, but bees are cynical little fucks and liked to play it cool and scared ken all the time.

Years after Vanessa and Barry first hit it off a group of bees called the Bee Deaders sent out a bunch of bees to sting Ken. They ended up killing him by noscoping him with bee stingers. Vanessa went to the funeral and peed on Ken's dead body.

69 days after that the Bee Deaders or the bd's as they liked to be called killed Vanessa. They killed her just as her and Barry were going to try the sex again. The first time Barry got stuck in her woman hole and Adam, Barry's long time bee friend had to save them. But, not before that had some hot bee sex!

Sadly enough in that beesome Adam accidently stung the inside of Vanessa's hole and got killed instantly. Barry cried for days. Vanessa was paralyzed after that because the scientists say that if you get stung in your cavern while you have two bees in there, it is like have 2345 men meat in there and your legs stop working.

But, to go back to the time Vanessa got killed, Barry crawled inside her jazz cafe the bd's noscoped her three times in a row. Luckily Barry crawled out of her muffin soon enogh to say the last goodbye.

"Ba- Baaaa- Barry, I looo- loo- lo- l- ….LOve you…."

"Vanessa, SPEAK TO ME. No this can't be happening. VANESSAAAAA."

Barry was very sad, he tried to make a suicide pact again but failed because he thought of Vanessa too much. He had a private funeral for her where he rubbed his ding dong mcdork on her thumb until he cried. Then he ate her remains.

420 years later Barry was still alone. He smoked weed every day and looked at pictures of Vanessa every other minute. But he also looked at pictures of Ken because Barry was a little gay for him. Sometimes Barry would feel frisky and pull out the picture of Ken Vanessa had that showed Ken's heat-seeking moisture missile. Barry liked his manhood.

But just as Barry was going to pull out the picture of Ken, he heard a loud knocking at the door. Barry flew to door. He opened it and saw a big green thing outside holding a dead donkey. Barry was hungry so he opened the door and asked the big guy what his name was.

"Whats your name mate"

" Uhhh, excuse me.. hehe"

Barry looked down to see that he had opened the door with his giant luigi hanging out. He quickly put some pants on and went back out to the man.

" Sorry bout that pal, so what do you need." Barry asked a little embarrassed but also bored and tired.

" I was wonderin' if you could help me bury this body." The green man asked with a glint in his eye.

"You wanna come in?" Barry asked, now interested in the man.

" If you were wondering, my name is Shrek." He flirted and winked before dumping the body on the carpet and sitting down on Barry's couch.

Barry was getting to be a little embarrassed, he had spent too long without the love. He didn't know how to handle all of this.

" So what's your name handsome." Shrek said giving Barry a sex look.

"B- Barry." He stuttered not making eye contact with Shrek.

Shrek inched closer to Barry reaching out his big green oniony fingers. Barry was scared but didn't move away.

"So Barry." Shrek said with a lot of sex. " What were you doing before you answered the door. You know when you weren't decent." Shrek winked at Barry again moving his hand closer to Barry's meter long king kong dong.

"Lonely stuff." Barry stammered because Shrek had finished his journey to Barry's old boy and left his hand there.

"Oh." Shrek said with seductive surprise. Barry cracked a nervous smile. " Your loneliness is all orge now."

"Oh Shrek please take me." Spit Barry in a moment of shock. He couldn't hold in the sex anymore.

"Barry yes." Shrek grab Barry and threw him onto the bed.

Barry grab onto Shrek's tonk and started to lick it. The sex got hot and steamy. Onion juice and honey got all over the room.

"OH Shrek." Barry screamed.

"LETS GET DONKEY." Shrek shrieked as he reached over and got donkey from the carpet. In a sex second he slid him into Barry's butt.

" Oh SHR-" Barry's scream was cut short when Shrek realized he got his hand stuff up Barry's wazoo.

"Barry I think we have a problem." Shrek tried to pull out but he felt something pull him in, another hand? Shrek didn't know.

"Oh haha sorry." Barry let go of his strong butt muscles and Shreks hand came easily out along with 4 school boys.

Upon seeing the little boys all about aged 5, Shrek insisted they join them in the sex. They had a orbee. Barry and Shrek and the boys enjoyed it very much. After they finished having the affair they all moved in with each other. Always giving each other the sex look. 9 months later Barry became pregnant and they had some babies. When the kids got to be 1 year olds, they all got married. It was a happy family.

"Do you Barry take Shrek, and these 5 succulent little boy to be your wifes?" The preacher asked lustfully, he loved little boys and their soft skin and how they felt on his member.

"Yes." Bary said with tears in his eyes.

They lived on for many more years before Barry got killed while inside of Shreks butt. 2 days later the little boys all jumped off a building while naked. It left Shrek alone and sad. He lived in alone in Barry's house for many years after that before finally dying of Shrek-t-ds.

I honestly dont even understand what people are talking about Is cuphead difficult? Yes Will you get a little, or even a lot mad? Yes More than once? Probably But is it the same teeth grinding vein popping heart attack inducing fuckfest of difficulty that Dark Souls is? Good god no. Dark Souls is a huge long slog through a dark dim world where just when you think you've gotten past that one thing youve spent 2 hours dealing with, you get ass raped by a band of spear skeletons. Then once you finally reach a boss, you get in and realize it's going to take you at least 5-10 tries to get his attacks down, 5-10 more to figure out some sort of pattern and the telegraphing, 5-10 more to actually get them down in their health seriously, and then even more to actually win Cuphead is a vastly different game. The "difficulty" the game proposes, while technically there, is more self challenging. I realized that while playing the other day. You could just sprint through the run and gun levels ignoring the parrys and time and health bonuses and even coins. You can do the same with the bosses, just focus on taking them down. Take Hilda Berg for example. If you just want to kill her to get her contract, it's difficult, but not too bad. All you really have to do is figure out her 3 basic obviously telegraphed attacks, move accordingly, and occasionally bother with the little planes. Then the moon phase, just hammer away and dodge the stars and UFO's. If you want a GOOD SCORE though, you have to focus on the little planes waiting for them to shoot the pink bullets, then get to those and parry them, while also not getting hit by the other on screen things to get the health bonus, and still trying to keep your guns locked on Hilda for the time bonus. I tried both ways, and it DEFINITELY takes more time and effort and anger when you actually choose to try. Although Dark Souls gives that option sometimes, it's much harder to actually just sprint through and ignore the challenges in your way. Usually there are huge strong enemies or groups blocking your way, and barreling through them definitely means youre gonna lose a lot of health, and by the time you get to the place where you need to be, if you can even make it, you won't have enough health.

Tl;dr Stop comparing Cup Head to Dark Souls they're totally different

Let me start by saying I have exquisite taste when it comes to gaming. So I played this Half-Lifes because it's so called "the best game ever created" BUT couldn't finish it because it's so bad. Why all the praise?? The audio quality sounds like it's coming from my HitClips, level design is blocky I feel like I'm in Minecraft which is a better game, story is basically written by 10 year old elementary students, and the graphics are ass...yeah talk about "best game ever created". The zombies are really stupid too. Where are their ExoSuits? Call of Duty invented the zombie creature years ago in World At War. They perfected their copyrighted enemy type in Advanced Warfare when they revolutionized the zombie by giving it an ExoSuit. Now that's what is talented character writing. Maybe take a cue, Valve? It is beyond me why anyone would prefer the Half-Lifes head lobster.
Next, where are my supply drops? I played a couple hours and didn't receive not one loot crate... And another failure on Valve's part is not including emotes/taunts. How am I supposed to dab on those head lobsters? CoD knows how to appeal to us, the younger and more dominant market. At least Valve nodded to my generation by including a fidget spinner in the opening titles. (P.S. #ClassOf2022 we out here!!! LESGEDDIT). Would've been nice if they let us actually use the damn spinner while I was pulling my hair out on that long ass floating bus ride in the first level. Where is the steering wheel for that bus anyway? And how the hell is it just floating in the air without an ExoSuit? Lol stupid devs. At least Ghostemane Freeman gets an ExoSuit in the initial level. But why can't I customize the ugly orange Exo? 
In conclusion, Half-Lifes is an old game and I'd think that the graphics would have had a chance to develop and evolve by now. Black Ops 3 is still very young but it's graphics have fully developed in a short time span... I can't even wallrun, only walk and hop wtf kind of movement system is this? Overall I give Half-Lifes a 3/10. I can only hope Valve sees this and applies my feedback to the third game, giving us the gameplay we desire in a modern FPS.. I look forward to dabbing on those Exo Head-Lobsters while slicing them with my fidget shurikens. Oh and they obviously copied Lamar from GTA V for the tamed head lobster in HL2.

I am currently on Day 404 of NoFap. As a sophomore in high school now, life has been so productive and great. My brain is growing faster than my body, spiritually and intellectually. My brain craves new information everyday. And masturbation and porn I have now quit permanently. They mean nothing to me now, having NO POWER. This goes to show that these urges you are getting, they will NOT last forever. However, they will not go away, but they will become EXTREMELY tame and practically unnoticeable most of the time. My urges as of now are not as powerful and controlling as they once were. Life is going at a great pace for me, not too fast, yet not too slow. I have been more happy in life than I ever have been... all thanks to NoFap. I was once a video game addicted, chronic porn user and wanker, having no purpose in life and no drive to do anything, and at the time i didn't even know it. But as the Icelandic proverb states, "a life without discipline, is a life without honour". And to that i agree because without this, and this amazing community, i would still be going nowhere.

Oh man, I definetely feel bad for you then. What's next? You're going to have a happy cry over the idea of being high fived by a dog?

To be fair, I totally get that people can be emotional towards certain events in their lives, but what's with all the people who starts crying over things? I sincerely don't get it. Do you completely lack over one of the basic bodily functions that the human body has? Somehow people manage to not soil themselves with urine and feces on most days (with the exception of those who has issues with incontinence, and even that's often due to nerve damage), but then you have seemingly normal people who just pour teats like Niagra Falls. How are they not dehydrated? Where is all that fluid coming from? Can they ship over this excessive fluid to people in other countries who are dying of thirst? So many questions, so few answers.

 All of these concerns are not actually concerns. They're a symptom you haven't yet become a JS dev. You have to throw yourself mentally into the ecosystem, wholeheartedly, as if you were diving into a pool. At that point every one of your concerns vanish:

- There is exactly one way to define a module. Write a file. Done. Webpack takes care of it.

- You were using Webpack, right?

- The fact that Webpack either wasn't on your radar or already solving your problems says a lot.

Look, I know this sounds like bullshit, and in fact it's very difficult to distinguish this from actual bullshit. But there are a huge number of people here -- old fogies, stuck in the past, yearning for the old days that are never coming back -- who hate JS, and that hatred manifests itself in ten thousand subtle ways.

Inventing the idea out of thin air that "there are 7 different ways to define a module" is simply false. It does not resemble reality. Yes, it's true you can point at all the dead module systems that came and went, but nobody bothers even thinking about those systems because they're dead. They're zombies. Yeah maybe some people use them, but realistically if you're getting shit done in JS that means you have webpack and all of these concerns are not actually concerns.

JS stdlib seems like nonsense? Lodash.

Feels like you're importing too much bloat? Webpack tree shaking takes care of that. Closure compiler eliminates all the code you're not using. There's no reason not to use a first-class stdlib, whether it's Lodash or whatever else you prefer.

- The JavaScript community seems to have the opposite of NIH syndrome, so that even basic functionality is offloaded to a third-party modules (see leftpad). The project I'm working on has over 1000 modules in it's dependency tree.

This is the power of JS. It's the thing to force yourself to embrace. You need to join the cult of bullshit and just mentally force yourself to love this rather than hate it. It's why JS won. You can hate it all you want and revel in the insanity, but there is zero reason to do that other than as a way of making yourself feel good. Which is just another way of saying we're all acting very selfish when we lash out at JS like this.

Yes, you're correct. Every one of your points is absolutely true. Yet it's all so very wrong. I wish I could put it into words better than this.

Look dude. I've been around the block. I vividly remember what this shit was like in 2008. You want pain? Holy shit, I remember trying to make a little arrow rotate on my webapp. I wanted finder-style arrow rotations. You know how on a tree view, each folder has a little arrow, and it points to the right when it's collapsed? Click on it, it rotates 90 degrees and points down, and the tree expands. YEah, I tried to do that in 2007 right when Rails 1 was first coming out. Talk about horror. The solution -- the only solution -- was to make an entire animation frame by frame, of the arrow rotating 90 degrees. Like 16 different images, just for this stupid arrow to rotate 90 degrees on command. Because CSS literally wasn't a thing back then. Yeah we had "CSS", but for all intents and purposes we are living in the future right now. We have tools that 2007-me could only dream of.

JS works now. That is not the expected behavior. It's difficult to convey how fucking strange this is. Anyone who lived through that 2006-era transition knows what I mean.

Right now you can drop Semantic UI into your project, hook up React to it, and have first class testing (Enzyme) and state management (Redux).

Don't like all that bullshit? No problem. Use Vue. It sidesteps all the Redux insanity. And the tooling is catching up.

But the way you know these things is by being a JS dev. Living and breathing it every day. There's no way around that. You either throw yourself wholeheartedly into the pool or keep one toe in while complaining about how big the ocean is.

im quite obvious a highly intellectual prodigious viewer of the show rick and morty only someone as misanthropic and talented would notice the juxtapostion between their cartoon multiverse and rick's nihilist perspectve, for my wokeness has unlocked the sharingan capable of this extraordinary task. The neanderthal logicality level of the average human is not capable of digesting complex-imaging methods used on the show like i do on a daily basis. I find it depressing realizing how isolated i am from the rest of human existence for the particular reason that my wisdom surpasses what they can understand

Hey what's up guys, It's Scarce and today we have some ground breaking stuff to talk about with you guys today, Jake Paul ate Cheerios today. That's right guys, JAKE PAUL usually eats Frosted Flakes but for some reason he decided that Cheerios were the way to go, I know guys it's unbelievable. I'm not sure why he would do this I mean it sounds pretty unbelievable if you ask me but he did it, so yeah let me know what you think in the comments below guys. Do you think Jake Paul is switching cereals? Anyway moving on to our next story about Ricegum's dandruff...﻿

Holy shit black people are so fucking annoying. Like seriously they smell so bad and they literally are objects just like women. If you think about it, black people are only good at entertainment.... music, athletics, dancing... they excel in these areas way more than any other race. But none of those things are gonna take us out of the solar system. White people and Asians have contributed more than anyone else to math and sciences, Indians have also helped somewhat. Native Americans are pretty fucking stupid too if you think about it, they never did shit except maybe inventing recycling or some gay shit like that. Anyway I’m rambling, I hate black people (and native Americans)

You’re 22.

Be turning 23 soon.

Ask parents for Shrek themed party.

Just like the last 12 years.

Mom says I'm too old for Shrek

Tell her she better check herself before she Shrek's herself

Mom asks if I've taken my meds.

I say yes, then ask for an onion flavored cake.

Mom says no.

I call her a Farquaad bitch.

She sends me to my room and tears stream down my face.

Jacking off will probably cheer me up.

Pull out super dreck MLP Friendship is Magic DVD collection

Open them up to see five Shrek discs (including Puss in Boots) that my mom thought were in her room.

Its the 171st day of the year.

Today I am scheduled to masturbate to Artie from Shrek the Third.

Fap furiously when Artie appears and am finished in seconds.

Wipe semen off my chest with Twilight Sparkle stuffed pony.

Start to think about fight with mother again.

Get an idea.

Sneak out of room.

Mom is sleeping.

Go to shed in backyard

Grab the sharpest tool in the shed.

Stand outside Mom's door.

Too chicken to do it. I pray to Shrek for courage.

The scent of onions fill the room.

A green hand takes the tool from me.

"I'll take it from here laddie." Shrek says.

Shrek plants the tool deep in my mother's body ogre and ogre again.

The stabbing went on for almost an hour.

Blood sprayed all ogre the room and on my body. Especially my hands and arms.

Shrek is finally finished with my mother and he looks at me.

I pull off my blood soaked clothes and poke my butt in the air.

Shrek picks me up with one hand and uses his Schlong to sweep the remains of my mother off of her bed.

Despite the carnage, it still smells like onions.

But now the smell of waffles and litter enter the room as well.

Donkey, Fiona and Puss are suddenly at my side.

All of them are just as nude as Shrek.

Shrek flops down on his back on the bed.

Blood pools around him as his weight squeezes it out of the mattress like a sponge.

He still has me in one hand.

He skewers me on his shrock and begins using my asshole to pleasure himself.

His slimy member provides lube, but it does nothing to stop the anal stretching as it flexibly snakes its way through my intestinal tract.

Princess Fiona jumps on top of me and I silently plead to Shrek that my small dick is enough to please her majesty.

Fiona slips my dick into her snatch and it closes in around my penis.

Her ogress pussy vacuums my dick with the frenzy of a Jack in the Box customer trying to get just one little taste of his ogrely thick milkshake.

It feels as if the inside of my woody is being sucked out my pee hole.

I am now in the middle of an ogre sandwich. An Ogreo if you will.

I motorboat her giant green titties and suck the onion juice out of her nipples.

All the while with Shrek's green anaconda still slithering inside me.

I turn my head to the left and gasp for breath.

As I do, Donkey stuffs my mouth with his schlong.

It quickly finds its way deep into my esophagus.

I am finding hard to breath with Donkey's "little Donkey" thrusting within, yet never receding from my gaping mouth as one of my nostrils is filled with snot.

Puss in Boots nimbly climbs up the others and drags his ass and balls on my face.

Puss turns around and I see his small barbed baculum poking out from his fur.

He examines my two nose cunts and thankfully chooses the one already filled with snot to jab his boner into.

It is the greatest moment of my life.

I submit myself completely to Fairy Tale Lands finest.

The amount of movement going in on inside of me is indescribable.

I am now 33% cock.

I reach around and claw at Fiona's rump, trying to get a chance to stick my fist in the greatest woman of all time.

Then, it happened.

Shrek and Donkeys foreskin meet together in my tummy.

Their tips lightly kiss one another, right before spewing a stew of cum inflating my stomach like a water balloon.

Seconds later, I spunk into Fiona's pussy.

My eyes roll back in my head.

I am breathing furiously yet only through one nostril.

It isn't ogre yet.

I release a lengthy stream of semen as I never have before.

Donkey and Shrek still seem to be filling me with their love like a hose of sperm.

I am pumping an inhuman amount of jizz into Fiona, when I realize that it must be Shrek and Donkey whose cum is helping to give me extra virility.

Puss's saw like wang is finally running out of mucus to drill out of my nose and it begins shaving off my nose hairs.

My nose bleeds a thick pink blood-semen cocktail courtesy of Puss in Boots.

After about a minute, Shrek and Donkey's ogresm is complete.

Seconds later mine is done too.

I am more satisfied and exhausted than I have been in my entire life.

But it still isn't ogre.

I look deeply and lovingly into Fiona's green eyes as Puss and Donkey retreat from my orifices.

She spills forth from her mouth a cascade of all our juices.

It drenches my face and I squint to see Fiona, Donkey, and Puss all looking down on me with adoration.

Between gulps, I gargle "Shrek is love. Shrek is life."

I fall gently to sleep with Shrek's penis still moving inside of me and mine still inside Fiona.

I wake up the next morning in my mothers bed to the smell of onions and waffles.

I am alone except for the unrecognizable corpse on the floor.

Shrek and the others must have licked the cum all off because all that is left was blood and a floury substance on my hand.

I go to the kitchen to find a plate of onion waffles waiting for me.

Finally I have a family who cares for me.

After eating the feast my lovers left me, I went to my room to tell the other brogres online about my Shreksperience.

I find a note on the door.

"I was thinking about your party, and I decided that you can have a Far Far Away party after all. It is your big day and it is up to you to decide how to spend it. I will bake you your onion cake and make brownies for everyone else. Even though you have grown up into a wonderful Prince Charming, you will always be my special little boy. Love Mommy."

Prince Charming?

PRINCE CHARMING?

That bitch deserved to die.

Holy fucking shit. Guys, this uprising is getting worse by the minute. Antifa has already taken the Eastern seaboard AND the West Coast, and they are moving inland.

I swear to god, I saw footage of Antifa supersoldiers gunning down white people. The rioters accompanying them cheered and the whites among them ritually shot themselves. There so was so much fucking blood.

I urge everyone still alive and in hiding in New York to head to the statue of liberty. It’s got some kind of aura that is preventing minorities from approaching. I can only assume Dear President Trump had it installed somehow, with all his foresight and wisdom, for this occasion. From there, there should be boats waiting to ferry people South to Florida. They’ve already killed their minorities and liberals as a precaution.

We laughed at the warnings, and now we’re paying the price.

God Speed, survivors.

With your High IQ did you realize that Rick and most of his family are the antagonists in the show?  Rick is the bad guy.  His  nihilistic views and super intelligence don't make him a good person.  He is just a non caring, alcoholic, asshole dragging everyone he knows into his misery.  (sounds strangely familiar doesn't it?)  In the episode with the vindicators,  this is reveled starkly.  As Rick lies blacked out, covered in his own feces you hear some reason from Morty.  Morty claims that ricks beliefs are not based in his intelligence or logic.  Rick "needs" his beliefs to be true because, If it is not true, Rick is truly evil.  There is a lesson there somewhere.  You can be smart and not enjoy rick and morty.  You would require some basic scientific knowledge to understand some of the nuances, but the show itself is crude.  Not everyone is going to enjoy it regardless of their education level.

Oh-ho-ho! What a funny pun there, my friend. It's truly original and really adds to the conversation. Ok, let's face it - we all like the occasional pun here and there. Heck, Shakespeare himself used them extensively!

But this begs the question: are you Shakespeare? Are you, indeed, one of the greatest, wittiest, most influential writers that has ever graced the earth that we now tread upon and abuse by using our electrical supplies to post puns on the internet? I think not. Thus, I humbly request that you immediately stop this pun thread. While they may come in handy sometimes (such as in the case of an intelligent literary discussion (which of course you'd have when discussing Shakespeare (whom I mentioned was extremely influential and witty (you may be as well, but it's unclear due to the anonymity of Reddit (that's the problem with Reddit - you never know who is behind the username and thus rely on your instincts and sense of trust (which is quickly lost on the internet (seriously, look at all the trolls on this website (I hate them because they contribute even less to the website than pun threads)))))))), they're usually just disruptive and end up contibuting nothing of use to any conversation, thus derailing all possibility of intelligent thought and discourse. It's no wonder the aliens haven't tried to contact us yet (not referring to illegal aliens, of course - just to be clear).

And thus, in concourse with my reasoning, and in light of trying to teach you a humble lesson, I award you a downpun. It is not due to hatred or malice; rather, it is for the purpose of steering you towards a better path in life, wherein you shall contribute more positively and intellectually to your society. Thusly, I wish you all the best in your life and travels.

May the force be with you, and live stronk and Casper, OP Juan Canopy.

Bruh I'm telling you if a girlfriend/boyfriend is ever stressing you out just kill half a bottle of whiskey and if they're still not feeling you after loosening up then they're probably gonna be hassle forever. Then you can kill the other half with some homies and not give a FuCKK cuz pokemon is life and will never betray you.

As of now, at this specific time in this specific area on this specific Earth and universe, I am experiencing mental and physiological reactions driven by my sex hormones and evolutionary programming to you, a member of the opposite sex of the species Homo Sapiens, possessing differing genitalia than I that I would like to unite with my own during the experience of sexual intercourse in which I will repeatedly stimulate my own genitals using yours until I reach sexual climax, resulting in the release of several bodily fluids as well as hormones in the brain that together create the feeling of "pleasure".

Tbh, this shitpost and shitcomments are examples of why I hate Reddit.
I mean, ok.
The eye is nice, and I’m sure OP is a nice guy and good friend, but honestly, what’s the point of this post? Does it contribute anything to humanity in any perceptible manner?
It really is downright awful. When the vast majority of Reddit's content is utter hooey, viewing such blaggadry all the time can only lead to further harm. Honestly, if most of Reddit's posts seem interesting to you, then, my friend, I think you need a serious chiroredditic adjustment! 😅
Not to offend your sensibilities, of course, but I've been on this website for less than one day, and boy oh boy, is there a lot of garbage. And that's considering just what's on the front page, which is supposed to be the epitome of content that we consume from the contemporary, modern World Wide Web.
I was introduced to this website with such high expectations. Lol and behold... I came to disappointment (that wouldn't be the first time I came to disappointment, of course (particularly in my house and bedroom (wait, I know this sounds dirty, but it isn't (it's referring to very personal experiences (but not sexual ones (at least not how the traditional Redditor defines them (granted, I doubt the average Redditor knows much about sexual experiences given what I've seen here today))))))). I, of course, don't want my friends to experience similar disappointment, and thus, vow to ensure I will prevent any ore new people from visiting this website.
Of course, efforts of such gigantic proportions require critical planning and subtle yet powerful execution. I must, therefore, start by fighting the system from within. The mission has begun.
EDIT: Pls stop the downvotes, I don't like them. They hurt me, because I'm just expressing my personal opinion and just trying to help Reddit be better. Pls be nice.
EDIT DOS (dos for the Hispanic speaking population of Reddit; I do not wish to be exclusive of minorities): Cease your downvotes at once, leftist librul snowflakes who are unable to take criticism! Or else I shall report each and every one of you to the administration and ensure your accounts get suspended. You're breaking Reddiquette by downvoting for disagreeing, while my comment is relevant to the discussion. Stop being bad Redditors!

I hate to admit it but you’re right. I was watching episode 8 of season 3 and suddenly they were sat in front of the interdimensional television. They began watching a show in which big game hunters began shooting at a House. My friend pointed out to me that this was a reference to house hunters. I broke down. I realized that everything the Internet has been telling us is right. People are born into groups. Those smart enough to understand the subtle jokes in Rick and Morty, and those like me. All I can do is continue to watch and pray that one day they will click. I am inferior.

A double mcspanky with fries and a slurp! That would be $6.53. And $3.47's your change. Dude, you're supposed to push the buttons with the pictures of food on em. Don't need to, Skeet.  I memorized the prices, did the tax and change in my head. Ugh, okay, mr. Magic Man I also did not hear you say Big Mcthankies from Mcspankies to the customer. Well frankly it struct me as cliche'd. What do you think about this? Don't let our food deny you Put unpoly unsaturated fats and dry clitorides inside you!

Picture of money, picture of money... HA got'cha. Big Mcthankies from Mcspankies! Hey dude, you missed a spot. I'll get it. Just a little sodium chloride. Actually, dude it's salt. That's what I said. Sodium chloride. Uh dude? That would be salt.  If you don't know what salt is, maybe my duties are too complicated for you.

‭‭A man is driving down the road and breaks down near a monastery. He goes to the monastery, knocks on the door, and says, “My car broke down. Do you think I could stay the night?”The monks graciously accept him, feed him dinner, even fix his car. As the man tries to fall asleep, he hears a strange sound.The next morning, he asks the monks what the sound was, but they say, “We can’t tell you. You’re not a monk.”The man is disappointed but thanks them anyway and goes about his merry way.Some years later, the same man breaks down in front of the same monastery.The monks accept him, feed him, even fix his car. That night, he hears the same strange noise that he had heard years earlier.The next morning, he asks what it is, but the monks reply, “We can’t tell you. You’re not a monk.”The man says, “All right, all right. I’m *dying* to know. If the only way I can find out what that sound was is to become a monk, how do I become a monk?”The monks reply, “You must travel the earth and tell us how many blades of grass there are and the exact number of sand pebbles. When you find these numbers, you will become a monk.”The man sets about his task. Forty-five years later, he returns and knocks on the door of the monastery. He says, “I have traveled the earth and have found what you have asked for. There are 145,236,284,232 blades of grass and 231,281,219,999,129,382 sand pebbles on the earth.”The monks reply, “Congratulations. You are now a monk. We shall now show you the way to the sound.”The monks lead the man to a wooden door, where the head monk says, “The sound is right behind that door.”The man reaches for the knob, but the door is locked. He says, “Real funny. May I have the key?”The monks give him the key, and he opens the door.Behind the wooden door is another door made of stone.The man demands the key to the stone door.The monks give him the key, and he opens it, only to find a door made of ruby.He demands another key from the monks, who provide it.Behind that door is another door, this one made of sapphire.So it went until the man had gone through doors of emerald, silver, topaz, and amethyst.Finally, the monks say, “This is the last key to the last door.”The man is relieved to no end.He unlocks the door, turns the knob, and behind that door he is amazed to find the source of that strange sound.But I can’t tell you what it is because you’re not a monk.

To be fair, you have to have very great moves to understand H3H3. The humour is extremely subtle, and without a solid grasp of Jewish tradition most of the jokes will go over a typical viewer’s head. There’s also Ethan’s cynical outlook, which is deftly woven into his characterisation- his personal philosophy draws heavily from Ethan Bradberry Prank Videos, for instance. The fans understand this stuff; they have the vaping capacity to truly appreciate the depths of these jokes, to realise that they’re not just funny- they say something deep about LIFE. As a consequence people who dislike H3H3 truly ARE idiots- of course they wouldn’t appreciate, for instance, the humor in Ethan’s existential catchphrase “#PapaBless,” which itself is a cryptic reference to John Schnatter's Italian epic Papa John's Pizza. I’m smirking right now just imagining one of those addlepated simpletons scratching their heads in confusion as Ethan and Hila Klein’s genius wit unfolds itself on their computer screens. What fools.. how I pity them. 😂

And yes, by the way, i DO have a Ethan & Hila tattoo. And no, you cannot see it. It’s for the ladies’ eyes only- and even then they have to demonstrate that they’re within 5 Great Moves of my own (preferably lower) beforehand. Nothin personnel kid 😎

How annoying when Redditors make dumb jokes in an obvious comment chain just for the internet World Wide Web karma points.  Do you really have nothing better to do than sit around on this website and make these inane little comments?  

I mean, I get it.  

It’s nice to sometimes just chill on a website and make a joke here and there.  Clears your head of the day’s stresses.  

But mans.  

I see this type of crap smeared all over this website.  It engorges me (with fury).  It makes me big (with anger).  It caresses me (with frustration).  It’s a horrible experience overall.  
I wish this would stop.  Just **STOP!!!**  

I think I’ve made my point clear.

It was common knowledge at this point that Ken was allergic to bees. And even though he denied it multiple times, he was also very scared of them. He always thought that they had it out for him. The bees didn't care for him much so he didn't really have to worry, but bees are cynical little fucks and liked to play it cool and scared ken all the time.

Years after Vanessa and Barry first hit it off a group of bees called the Bee Deaders sent out a bunch of bees to sting Ken. They ended up killing him by noscoping him with bee stingers. Vanessa went to the funeral and peed on Ken's dead body.

69 days after that the Bee Deaders or the bd's as they liked to be called killed Vanessa. They killed her just as her and Barry were going to try the sex again. The first time Barry got stuck in her woman hole and Adam, Barry's long time bee friend had to save them. But, not before that had some hot bee sex!

Sadly enough in that beesome Adam accidently stung the inside of Vanessa's hole and got killed instantly. Barry cried for days. Vanessa was paralyzed after that because the scientists say that if you get stung in your cavern while you have two bees in there, it is like have 2345 men meat in there and your legs stop working.

But, to go back to the time Vanessa got killed, Barry crawled inside her jazz cafe the bd's noscoped her three times in a row. Luckily Barry crawled out of her muffin soon enogh to say the last goodbye.

"Ba- Baaaa- Barry, I looo- loo- lo- l- ….LOve you…."

"Vanessa, SPEAK TO ME. No this can't be happening. VANESSAAAAA."

Barry was very sad, he tried to make a suicide pact again but failed because he thought of Vanessa too much. He had a private funeral for her where he rubbed his ding dong mcdork on her thumb until he cried. Then he ate her remains.

420 years later Barry was still alone. He smoked weed every day and looked at pictures of Vanessa every other minute. But he also looked at pictures of Ken because Barry was a little gay for him. Sometimes Barry would feel frisky and pull out the picture of Ken Vanessa had that showed Ken's heat-seeking moisture missile. Barry liked his manhood.

But just as Barry was going to pull out the picture of Ken, he heard a loud knocking at the door. Barry flew to door. He opened it and saw a big green thing outside holding a dead donkey. Barry was hungry so he opened the door and asked the big guy what his name was.

"Whats your name mate"

" Uhhh, excuse me.. hehe"

Barry looked down to see that he had opened the door with his giant luigi hanging out. He quickly put some pants on and went back out to the man.

" Sorry bout that pal, so what do you need." Barry asked a little embarrassed but also bored and tired.

" I was wonderin' if you could help me bury this body." The green man asked with a glint in his eye.

"You wanna come in?" Barry asked, now interested in the man.

" If you were wondering, my name is Shrek." He flirted and winked before dumping the body on the carpet and sitting down on Barry's couch.

Barry was getting to be a little embarrassed, he had spent too long without the love. He didn't know how to handle all of this.

" So what's your name handsome." Shrek said giving Barry a sex look.

"B- Barry." He stuttered not making eye contact with Shrek.

Shrek inched closer to Barry reaching out his big green oniony fingers. Barry was scared but didn't move away.

"So Barry." Shrek said with a lot of sex. " What were you doing before you answered the door. You know when you weren't decent." Shrek winked at Barry again moving his hand closer to Barry's meter long king kong dong.

"Lonely stuff." Barry stammered because Shrek had finished his journey to Barry's old boy and left his hand there.

"Oh." Shrek said with seductive surprise. Barry cracked a nervous smile. " Your loneliness is all orge now."

"Oh Shrek please take me." Spit Barry in a moment of shock. He couldn't hold in the sex anymore.

"Barry yes." Shrek grab Barry and threw him onto the bed.

Barry grab onto Shrek's tonk and started to lick it. The sex got hot and steamy. Onion juice and honey got all over the room.

"OH Shrek." Barry screamed.

"LETS GET DONKEY." Shrek shrieked as he reached over and got donkey from the carpet. In a sex second he slid him into Barry's butt.

" Oh SHR-" Barry's scream was cut short when Shrek realized he got his hand stuff up Barry's wazoo.

"Barry I think we have a problem." Shrek tried to pull out but he felt something pull him in, another hand? Shrek didn't know.

"Oh haha sorry." Barry let go of his strong butt muscles and Shreks hand came easily out along with 4 school boys.

Upon seeing the little boys all about aged 5, Shrek insisted they join them in the sex. They had a orbee. Barry and Shrek and the boys enjoyed it very much. After they finished having the affair they all moved in with each other. Always giving each other the sex look. 9 months later Barry became pregnant and they had some babies. When the kids got to be 1 year olds, they all got married. It was a happy family.

"Do you Barry take Shrek, and these 5 succulent little boy to be your wifes?" The preacher asked lustfully, he loved little boys and their soft skin and how they felt on his member.

"Yes." Bary said with tears in his eyes.

They lived on for many more years before Barry got killed while inside of Shreks butt. 2 days later the little boys all jumped off a building while naked. It left Shrek alone and sad. He lived in alone in Barry's house for many years after that before finally dying of Shrek-t-ds.

Weird...during the few years I did it I was in the best shape strength-wise I'd ever been in, (I was a skinny rock climber but New Orleans is flat and for the first time I put on bulk) and had a lot of fun learning to lift weights. and I made good friends at a place I just moved to, and I saw a lot of obese people get a lot of confidence because before they lost weight they first got a lot stronger. They could lift a lot more than a fit but skinny kid like me. I could do a lot more hand stand push-ups but fat chance I could dead lift more than them. I never did any competitions but the first day I did 100 burpees in one go was probably the most exhausting thing I've done since summit day on Kilimanjaro. My wife still mentions how much she misses what she calls my crossfit butt. I have a lot less time to work out now that I'm in a high risk line of work studying medical applications of snake venoms for my PhD and a snakebite I got in Ecuador necessitated a surgery that has made working out pretty tough so I'm working on a 6 ft 175 pound dad bod now. Climbing will always be my favorite but crossfit was a great change of pace and I definitely miss it. So I don't think you've done crossfit, and I don't think you care what I have to say, but why go out of your way to disparage something that clearly helps people get in shape, and offers people a friendly and supportive place to learn a new set of skills just because you like to jump on every internet fad that comes along. Have you heard more people bragging about crossfit or making fun of it? Cult...I play magic the gathering and D&D too, I guess I'm just a cultaholic...oh yes, and I love fidget spinners.

Are you kidding your dog? You know I was involved in a very secret attack. "Al-Qaeda" in order to put an end to the special summit of the fleet command killed more than 300 people. I am a hero with a gorilla and I am the best gunman in America. The army is another target, you have nothing. I want to cut you, I never heard that word Remember my words Do you think you can escape by saying you are on the internet? Offer yourself again. If we say we are talking today with his secret network and American spies and your IP track, you will be better prepared for the larval storm. Storm can eliminate the bad things you call life. Particularly interested in love. I can live everywhere and often kill you more than 700 ways in your hands. I am not a fully armed US Navy athlete. I used all this and I rubbed my face in the vaginal sperm. If you know that evil makes you feel good, you can write your language. But you can not be in the place now, you will pay the price you fool. I want to swallow the pain and swallow it. Particularly interested in love.

The adults around me in my youth convinced me that I was gifted and talented. It wasn't until I became an adult that I found out that I have an IQ of 94, so I am medically retarded. I had to cope with this fact alone in adulthood.

Uhm, ok. What was the point of this comment exactly? I mean, I get it. You like their comment and feel happy. You realized something incredible! Mindblowing. And you want to express that. I've had those times as well... let's face it, it's a normal form of communication. But, your inane comment simply adds nothing of value to the conversation. What does this do? Does it make you feel old to be part of the team? Does it make you happy to say that you're following his thought patterns? Is this really what you want out of Life?

I think you can do better, son. That's why I'm going to use the parental approach, and give you a downvote. Not because I dislike you. But because I want to teach you this very valuable lesson. Contribute to conversation - to society, my friend. Don't be a follower, be a leader. Even if it means you get downteachered as I'm fairly certain I will (but I'm brave and wise enough to comprehend the ill and negligible value of internet points, so that's irrelevant).

Adding two instances of the numerical value of two to each other produces the sum of four.
Subtracting one from this sum results in the number three.
I have just demonstrated an example of the study of numbers done in a speedy fashion.

On each passing day the individual is located on the solid cube of hard material.
Ignite large organisms of the plant kingdom on fire and slowly inhale the collection of airborne particulates generated from the combustion.

I watch and observe that individual that identifies as the female gender in the area of natural space set aside for human enjoyment.
After taking everything into consideration I conclude that that particular female is an "uckers".

When the distinct inanimate object generated the sound similar to the sound ducks produce, exactly three times.
You, a male human being, were lowering your body quickly so as to hide yourself.

Human individual that chooses to identify himself as "Azsnee", please wait and do not perform any actions for now.
The fellow person of the male sex is the sole owner of the object I refer to as "pumpee".

Other fellow male human being that I own, please also wait a bit and refrain from doing anything.
The other fellow individual possesses a flat disc-shaped item that can fly long distances in the air when thrown with strength and given a spin.

I proceed to lure an entity into a planted device designed to catch it, three consecutive times.
And I do this on the piece of paved land designed to allow large vehicles to be driven on it.
I transport and set into motion the popular breakfast cereal called "Corn Flakes".

I now randomly mention the name of another well known cereal "Rice Krispies".
Just like I instructed the two previous humans, I also advise you, the person of the female sex that belongs to me, that goes by the name of "Whitney", to stand by and remain in readiness.

While on the paved route I am currently creating ten appendages that typically protrude out of the foot of animals that have feet.
I ask you to please enjoy and be fond of my pedal digits.

You, a masculine adult, held the belief that the water in my body had cooled down and changed its physical state to that of a solid.
I visually perceive a physically attractive female human being which causes me to assume an intentionally seductive body position.

If the said female human is not situated on the thing, then I quickly leave the premises as if I turned into an apparition of a dead person that can appear in the world of the living.
I laugh, but you should also direct your gaze towards the body part responsible for the sense of smell that projects above your mouth.

"Could you please repeat what you said?" I say in a loud manner.
"I choose to equate you with the distal tip of the male sexual organ."
Again, I instruct you to direct your eyes downwards towards the central protruding organ of your face, your nose.

The end-to-end distance of your nose is so long that it can be visually compared to a flexible tube that is used to spray water in a garden.
I now proceed to make an attempt at reproducing the sound that said garden hose makes when active, using my mouth.

I ask you to confirm whether you have in fact succeeded in attaining me.
I try to imitate the sound of a sudden gaseous expansion usually caused by a bomb.
The human person is planning to return back to his internal location.

Could you please divulge your honest opinion on whether you do look on with favor to that?
Also could you please declare whether your bodily senses are perceiving that?

I proclaim that you have in fact done already known all along.
I am visually discerning that your superficial muscles are shaking uncontrollably as if you are frightened.
Please do not react in fear as if you have just witnessed an unexpected event, fellow male member of the Homo sapiens species.
You are currently guaranteed to be safe from any harm, the fact of which is typically referred to as being "protected".
But I also like to add another "ed" syllable at the end of this word.
Affirmative?

I now proceed to mimic the sound produced in a violent explosion.
I present the suggestion that both you and I should depart from the place we're currently residing in.
For a second time I reproduce the sound of a fiery explosion.

Exit the vehicle containing four hinged doorways in one quick maneuver while holding a .44 caliber pistol.
The first four integers in the numeral system were all, in fact, in existence.

The temperature of my body is gradually becoming colder while I'm situated in a long roofed passage inside a building.
The male human individual whose gamete conceived you has been living in this world for at least forty-four years.

This same person is still using a modern telecommunications device to contact another human being and request the artistic production of a picture made with pencil and paper.

Please disclose to your male biological parent what I am about to say next.
As soon as said person falls within my visual field.
I will initiate the action of grabbing and quickly rotating horizontally the mandible bone in the lower part of his face.

I order you to retrieve a chocolate bar going by the name "Twix" belonging to the fellow male individual, using physical violence if necessary.
Please also order this same human to visit an establishment where goods are sold for financial profit, again using physical strength when needed.

The person of the female gender that belongs to you is correctly aware that I have full access to the semi-liquid substance that is typically added to a meal to add flavor.
I do not own any tomato-based condiment however.

It is only the same creamy fluid used for savory dishes that I desire.
This preparation is also pure and not cooked or processed in any way.

Now I'm going to reproduce the sound generated in an explosive blast one more time, say a short slang term used to greet someone or call for attention, and utter the non-existent and meaningless word "gah".

The object without a precise designation, often referred to simply as "thing", but which I pronounce without the letter "h", produces a vast array of sounds that I find very difficult to describe using just the English language. Therefore I am instead going to try to mimic the sounds with my own voice while making convincing gestures using my hands, arms and whole body. The sounds vary from those consisting of just one syllable to more complicated ones that require me to move and slide my tongue along the roof of my mouth very quickly and repeatedly. Some of the sounds resemble those caused by bullet-firing weapons while others are similar to explosive detonations. However, some people would say that they are actually unintelligible words and would classify them as gibberish. I have to admit that one of the reasons I am in fact making all these sounds is to produce a humorous effect by intentionally emphasizing the ridiculousness of it all.

I again repeat the fact that you have done already known.
As a unique individual I choose to identify myself using the name "Big Shaq".

Now I proceed to utter multiple monosyllables that start with the letter "y".

I'd like to inform you that there is a process of rapid oxidation of flammable material under way right now, which is releasing a significant amount of heat and light.
This is happening in the small compartment we are currently inside, and I choose to inform you of this exactly three times.

Could you confirm if you do in fact acquire me?
The male individual belonging to the Homo sapiens species has a temperature value which is not so high that it would cause him discomfort.

I explain this fact to the fellow female person by saying, "The male human does not in fact have a high degree of heat."
Again, I repeat the same thing to the same female, "The individual of the male sex is not perceiving a sensation of great bodily heat."

The human being identifying herself as the female gender requested me to remove my thick outer garment from my body.

I replied to her by saying, "Informal term that literally means a very young toddler but is typically used to describe a good looking female human person, the male individual is in fact not feeling as if his internal body temperature has a significantly high value."

I then proceed to shout "The human being of the male sex cannot ever have a high enough temperature that could cause a sensation similar to that of burning, not now or any other time in the future."

I will now say the formal term that describes the bodily process wherein fluid is produced by sweat glands in the skin of most mammals and is then left to evaporate, with the result of heat being dissipated off the animal's body.
I have also decided to add the slang term "ting" right after.

Next, I will mention the name of the brand "Lynx" that, among other products, manufactures several types of deodorants which are used to cut down on the unpleasant body odors that can be caused by excessive sweating.
I will also say the English word that describes a change which is a result of a previously performed action.

Okay well I haven't, but I'm damn near tempted to until everyone has forgotten about Rick and fucking Morty. I can't go anywhere without someone referencing it, it's to the point where every thread I read has at least one comment talking about Rick and fucking Morty.

Let me explain why this is such a problem for me. Firstly, Rick makes me feel sick. His constant drool and burping makes me nauseous, maybe it's just traits of alcoholism in general and not just Rick. But due to how many people can get past that, I figured I should try and move past it myself. I figure I can get over it.

So then I come to a video on my subscription feed from a channel called "I hate everything" talking about why the fans suck. At the time I was eating a tuna, bacon and tomato pasta salad. Sounds nice, but it was ready made and you know how they dim the taste. It was alright, but I was only eating it because I was hungry (this is important).

So I'm eating the pasta and agreeing muchly with the uploader, but at the end of video he makes my neusea that much worse by belching as sickly as he can. Not only did he seemingly lack the maturity to edit it out ("Oh my God he burps! So quirky!") but he made a comment about how gross it is and blows it away.

So now, every time I'm hungry or read the name "Rick" I begin feeling sick, partly because someone with a smarmy British accent (I'm British too, calm down) still thinks belching makes you sound smart, and of course everyone's fucking obsession with a shitty cartoon.
This is the main reason, you can't fucking escape. Even in /r/cosplaygirls where geeks go to fap, there are Rick and Morty cosplay (yes, typing that was psychologically painful).

Oh and the "to be fair" IQ meme is not fucking funny anymore. It got old, fast. It became a rule on /r/iamverysmart not to use it, but then everyone just decided to spam it in the comments instead.

Oh and don't get me started on the "you're either with us, or against us" mentality from the war against social justice which has also plagued the fuck out of Reddit. This caused a brigade against me a few weeks ago because someone linked a small comment I made that meant hardly anything.

While I could school this stupid Huffpo reject with that argument, I'll make another one instead. No man or country has ever been without a religion. It is impossible. It's like saying you don't have a lungs or a heart. This Devin Patrick Kelley character was just a proselytizer of the worst kind. Having been convinced of his own superiority he decided to massacre a vulnerable group of Christians.
Like nearly every atheist, he thought that Christians and our culture impede progress. He thought that we were the chronic persecutors of innocent and marginalized groups. I'm sure that he, like nearly all atheists, had an ideal model for The Perfect State. A Star Trek like utopia could be realized if we troglodytes could just accept that God doesn't exist. Therein lies his religion, his motivation for punishing that unfortunate congregation, and the God of his own creation.
Atheists, I'm not saying that Christians are better than you. I'm just saying that I'm not impressed by you. I have gone full circle, myself. I bought into the nonsense of Nietzshe as well as other Modernist Philosophers and drew out my own model of a socialist Tower of Babel when I was a teenager. Intellectuals of this vein have never built a sustainable society based on their newly discovered values, let alone a just one. Devin Kelley had the same mentality as Stalin and Mao. How could you say they don't have that in common? Their total kill count is about 20 million Christians.
While these Secular Extremists can't seem to graduate past the theoretical stage of building a decent society and multi-millenia culture, Christians have thrived for two-thousand years. In fact, these two-years of Pax-Christianitatis have been more productive than the other 148,000 years of human existence. 
Secular Fundamentalists criticize christianity for not being absolutely perfect, but the evidence is pretty substantial that we couldn't have had a modern world without the intellectual tradition of, as the Muslims call us, "the people of the book". Western Culture has surpassed all others in establishing sciences and law, and historians are now coming to realize that they couldn't have existed without the nurturing and protection of the Clergy. Christianity has united classes and races better than anything the Secular Liberals can invent, yet they spread myths about it.
If you believe the world would be a better place without Christianity and the teachings of Jesus Christ, I hope you are discouraged by what I said. If you still think that Christians stand in the way of a better society, all I can say is that the deacon and I are both armed. If you accept the truth I speak here and insist on remaining an atheist, I'm not going to hold it against you. Just stop turning a blind eye to the global persecution.

You’re 22.

Be turning 23 soon.

Ask parents for Shrek themed party.

Just like the last 12 years.

Mom says I'm too old for Shrek

Tell her she better check herself before she Shrek's herself

Mom asks if I've taken my meds.

I say yes, then ask for an onion flavored cake.

Mom says no.

I call her a Farquaad bitch.

She sends me to my room and tears stream down my face.

Jacking off will probably cheer me up.

Pull out super dreck MLP Friendship is Magic DVD collection

Open them up to see five Shrek discs (including Puss in Boots) that my mom thought were in her room.

Its the 171st day of the year.

Today I am scheduled to masturbate to Artie from Shrek the Third.

Fap furiously when Artie appears and am finished in seconds.

Wipe semen off my chest with Twilight Sparkle stuffed pony.

Start to think about fight with mother again.

Get an idea.

Sneak out of room.

Mom is sleeping.

Go to shed in backyard

Grab the sharpest tool in the shed.

Stand outside Mom's door.

Too chicken to do it. I pray to Shrek for courage.

The scent of onions fill the room.

A green hand takes the tool from me.

"I'll take it from here laddie." Shrek says.

Shrek plants the tool deep in my mother's body ogre and ogre again.

The stabbing went on for almost an hour.

Blood sprayed all ogre the room and on my body. Especially my hands and arms.

Shrek is finally finished with my mother and he looks at me.

I pull off my blood soaked clothes and poke my butt in the air.

Shrek picks me up with one hand and uses his Schlong to sweep the remains of my mother off of her bed.

Despite the carnage, it still smells like onions.

But now the smell of waffles and litter enter the room as well.

Donkey, Fiona and Puss are suddenly at my side.

All of them are just as nude as Shrek.

Shrek flops down on his back on the bed.

Blood pools around him as his weight squeezes it out of the mattress like a sponge.

He still has me in one hand.

He skewers me on his shrock and begins using my asshole to pleasure himself.

His slimy member provides lube, but it does nothing to stop the anal stretching as it flexibly snakes its way through my intestinal tract.

Princess Fiona jumps on top of me and I silently plead to Shrek that my small dick is enough to please her majesty.

Fiona slips my dick into her snatch and it closes in around my penis.

Her ogress pussy vacuums my dick with the frenzy of a Jack in the Box customer trying to get just one little taste of his ogrely thick milkshake.

It feels as if the inside of my woody is being sucked out my pee hole.

I am now in the middle of an ogre sandwich. An Ogreo if you will.

I motorboat her giant green titties and suck the onion juice out of her nipples.

All the while with Shrek's green anaconda still slithering inside me.

I turn my head to the left and gasp for breath.

As I do, Donkey stuffs my mouth with his schlong.

It quickly finds its way deep into my esophagus.

I am finding hard to breath with Donkey's "little Donkey" thrusting within, yet never receding from my gaping mouth as one of my nostrils is filled with snot.

Puss in Boots nimbly climbs up the others and drags his ass and balls on my face.

Puss turns around and I see his small barbed baculum poking out from his fur.

He examines my two nose cunts and thankfully chooses the one already filled with snot to jab his boner into.

It is the greatest moment of my life.

I submit myself completely to Fairy Tale Lands finest.

The amount of movement going in on inside of me is indescribable.

I am now 33% cock.

I reach around and claw at Fiona's rump, trying to get a chance to stick my fist in the greatest woman of all time.

Then, it happened.

Shrek and Donkeys foreskin meet together in my tummy.

Their tips lightly kiss one another, right before spewing a stew of cum inflating my stomach like a water balloon.

Seconds later, I spunk into Fiona's pussy.

My eyes roll back in my head.

I am breathing furiously yet only through one nostril.

It isn't ogre yet.

I release a lengthy stream of semen as I never have before.

Donkey and Shrek still seem to be filling me with their love like a hose of sperm.

I am pumping an inhuman amount of jizz into Fiona, when I realize that it must be Shrek and Donkey whose cum is helping to give me extra virility.

Puss's saw like wang is finally running out of mucus to drill out of my nose and it begins shaving off my nose hairs.

My nose bleeds a thick pink blood-semen cocktail courtesy of Puss in Boots.

After about a minute, Shrek and Donkey's ogresm is complete.

Seconds later mine is done too.

I am more satisfied and exhausted than I have been in my entire life.

But it still isn't ogre.

I look deeply and lovingly into Fiona's green eyes as Puss and Donkey retreat from my orifices.

She spills forth from her mouth a cascade of all our juices.

It drenches my face and I squint to see Fiona, Donkey, and Puss all looking down on me with adoration.

Between gulps, I gargle "Shrek is love. Shrek is life."

I fall gently to sleep with Shrek's penis still moving inside of me and mine still inside Fiona.

I wake up the next morning in my mothers bed to the smell of onions and waffles.

I am alone except for the unrecognizable corpse on the floor.

Shrek and the others must have licked the cum all off because all that is left was blood and a floury substance on my hand.

I go to the kitchen to find a plate of onion waffles waiting for me.

Finally I have a family who cares for me.

After eating the feast my lovers left me, I went to my room to tell the other brogres online about my Shreksperience.

I find a note on the door.

"I was thinking about your party, and I decided that you can have a Far Far Away party after all. It is your big day and it is up to you to decide how to spend it. I will bake you your onion cake and make brownies for everyone else. Even though you have grown up into a wonderful Prince Charming, you will always be my special little boy. Love Mommy."

Prince Charming?

PRINCE CHARMING?

That bitch deserved to die.

Obi-Wan doesn't need to be **on** the high ground, the high ground just needs to *exist* within the battle; Obi-Wan knows that when he has the low ground, he really has the high ground, from a certain point of view; see [Diagram A](http://imgur.com/a/MGopB). 

Look at his battle record:

Vader rematch: No high ground, loses

Obi-Wan with the high/low ground is canonically the most powerful Jedi. This is **fact**. Had Yoda not denied his request to battle The Senate with typical Jedi arrogance, Obi-Wan could have defeated Palpatine in the Senate building, which housed a variety of different altitudes; this was designed so that the Chancellor could always have the moral high ground in political debates. But Obi-wan didn't fight The Senate, and Yoda soon learned that you can't cleave the Sheev in a normal 1v1. It took the Tusken Raiders years of conflict against Old Ben Kenobi to grasp his superiority in terrain advantage, as you see them visibly flee in ANH when they realize he holds the low (inverse-high) ground; this was the optimal strategy against a near-invincible opponent. 


Yoda is shorter than virtually every other fighter, which gives him a permanent low-ground disadvantage; however, his saber-fighting style utilizes a flipping-heavy technique in order to negate this weakness for a temporary window. You'll notice that, after falling from the central podium in The Senate's building, he immediately retreats upon realizing he is on the lowest ground. You'll also notice that, while training Luke, he rides on him like a mount, to gain the intellectual high ground and accelerate Luke's training. [Example D](http://imgur.com/a/UhgYZ)
.
Obi-Wan's defensive Form III lightsaber style synergizes with his careful military maneuvers; as he only strikes when prepared, he can always hold the strategic high ground. (The business on Cato Neimodia doesn't count.)  You'll come to realize that this is why Commander Cody's artillery strike failed against Obi-Wan, when hundreds of Jedi were killed in similar attacks. Cody failed to grasp the strategic situation, as the Jedi Master's elevation was superior to his by hundreds of meters, making him virtually unkillable. (You'll notice that all the Jedi killed in Order 66 were on level ground with the clones, thereby assuring their demise.) Had Cody taken his time and engaged the Jedi on even terrain, he would have succeeded. Obi-Wan subsequently retreated under the surface of the lake, so that he could maintain the topographical low/high ground. This is why Obi-Wan is so willing to fight against impossible odds to the point where [he thrusts himself in immediate danger](http://imgur.com/a/i2GwA); when your probability of victory is 1-to-10, you have the statistical (and therefore strategic) low ground, a numerical advantage when you use your point of view to flip the value to 10/1 . Almost losing is, in Obi-Wan's case, certain victory. (See [Example E](http://imgur.com/a/A5WwZ)).
 

As we all know, spinning is a good trick. However, only the Chosen One can spin outside of a starfighter. Palpatine tried spinning, but he lost due to this technique (but this was intentional, as losing gave him the emotional high ground when Anakin arrived). The reason for this is that spinning provides a yin-yang approach to combat (based in Eastern philosophy on balance), giving the spinner the high ground from above and below. Only the Chosen One can master the spin, as it is their destiny to maintain balance in the universe. This is why Obi-Wan was so emotional after defeating Vader on Mustafar; he expected to lose the high ground to the spin, but Anakin fell to the dark side and could no longer use his signature trick, becoming the very thing he swore to destroy. Additionally, Anakin told Obi-Wan that, from "[his] point of view, the Jedi are evil". This broadens Anakin's mind to the concept of relativity in the context of the moral high ground, a mere step away from tactical comprehension. 

Anakin doesn't hate sand for the reasons he told Padme; **all** Jedi hate sand, as the battlefield can rapidly change between low and high ground on multiple vectors, so your perspective must be from a certain three-dimensional point of view in order to comprehend who holds the high ground. This is the only reason why Obi-Wan killed Maul in Rebels. This is also the reason why Obi-Wan hates flying; there is no gravity in space, therefore there is no high or low ground from any frame of reference (This also negates the spinning trick, as noted in [Example F](http://imgur.com/a/LfPDz)).


In ANH, Vader proves his newfound mastery by engaging Obi on perfectly even ground. However, Obi-Wan intentionally sacrifices himself on the Death Star, so that he could train Luke from a higher plane of existence, thereby giving him the metaphysical high ground [Example G](http://imgur.com/a/wIi43).

Why was Vader so invested in the construction and maintenance of the Death Star? Because he knows Obi-wan can't have the high ground if there's no ground left. [Image A](http://imgur.com/a/clEuG). As seen through the events of the Clone Wars, Obi-Wan was known to be on friendly terms with Senator Organa, whose homeworld held large quantities of mountainous terrain, the *perfect* habitat for a Jedi Master. Grand Moff Tarkin was already in position to destroy Alderaan as a first target, as the distance from Scarif to Alderaan was too vast to reach between the escape and recapture of the Tantive IV, even at 1.0 lightspeed. Alderaan had been the initial target all along, as Obi-Wan with the high ground was the primary threat to the Death Star. How? Because a moon-sized space station would have some form of gravitational pull, thereby negating Obi-Wan's zero-gravity weakness; Obi-Wan with the perpetual high-ground in a low-orbit starfighter would easily be able to fire proton torpedoes through a ventilation shaft, although the Empire was uncertain of the specific weakness of the Death Star planted by Galen Erso (who was a good friend).

In Return of the Jedi, you can see that the Throne Room contains a variety of different altitudes; Palpatine placed these there to ensure Vader's defeat. However, Sheev failed to realize that his weakness was *no* ground, and should have covered that useless gaping pit which does nothing.

A common misconception is the idea of a 'prostrate position' version of the high ground, wherein Obi-Wan lies flat on his back, giving him tactical superiority from his point of view. However, this strategy is futile, as for the high ground to come into effect, there must be a differential between parties on both the x-axis and y-axis to a moderately significant variation from both absolutes (Angles only a Sith would deal in). For Obi-Wan's high ground powers to be in full effect, he must stand between 15 and 75 degrees (π/12 to 5π/12 radians) diagonal from his opponent(s) on any quadrant of the area circle; this has been dubbed the Trigonometric Perspective Diagram. ([Diagram B](http://imgur.com/a/SLLjR)). The total effect for conventional high ground advantage can be calculated via the MetaComm Equation, or  f(x) = lim 0→x  π/12 | 7π/12  5π/12 | 11π/12 Ʃ(x) (2tan(x) / 3sin(x) + (log10Δ)) * cΦ 

Δ = distance on hypotenuse (meters)

Φ = Surrounding Force [c (variable) * β (Earth Gravity) * (pressure (psi)/2.2)]

'x' refers to the angle of contact between the two parties on, with advantage being based purely on position on the Y-axis, as the vast majority of force users base their perception on elevation rather than spacial relativity. 

The power of gravitational force has great effect on the high ground; too weak, and the high ground holds no traction; too strong and the ground becomes the real enemy. Experimentation has proven that the high ground typically holds significant value between .8 and 1.4 β (Earth Gravities) with maximum impact standing roughly equal to 1.05. 

Pressure is equally important, as it is a surrounding force attached to gravity (the high ground has famously low impact in aquatic environments). Pressure(λ) is measured in pounds per square inch (psi), to be used as a gravity multiplier (or division if pressure is sub-atmospheric; Φ (Surrounding Force) is a variable defined as β * 2.2λ , with no metric value assigned due to its singular application in the MetaComm equations. 

In situations regarding Obi-Wan and his relativistic point of view, you must substitute the Quadrilateral MetaComm Equation (the Jedi Master function), f(x) = lim 0→x minmaxƩ (2tan(x) / 3sin(x) ) * (1.2)cΦ [min = (|cos(x)| = 1) | (|sin(x)| = 1) + π/12 ), max = (|cos(x)| = 1) | (|sin(x)| = 1) + 5π/12 ]. 

The viable Φ field is expanded, as Obi-Wan has taken advantage of the high ground in so many different environments that he simply uses it more efficiently, and the min/max values apply due to his multidimensional point of view, evidenced by the Trigonometric Perspective Diagram. Additionally, the distance factor does not affect Obi-Wan, as spacetime can be perseptively compressed, giving him the ideal Δ value from his point of reference.

In conclusion, Obi-Wan abuses spatial relativity and Taoist doctrine in order to always invoke his high-ground powers. To properly analyze the strategic genius of Kenobi, one must hold advanced knowledge in Philosophy, Mathematics, and Calculus-based Physics, and be able to integrate these topics together.

As I wound my hands in a twisting motion around the cap for it to open, I contemplated all the things in my life that have led up to this moment. Not a whole lot. I lost all my worries as the sharp scent came wafting up from the bottle to my nose. It smelled… There are no words in the English language just to describe how it smelled. It smelled like worlds colliding. It smelled like the last croak of the poor, pathetic pidgeon as a one-hundred-and-twenty-pound rat leaps out of the sewer grate and swallows it whole. I don’t know how they do it, but they seemed to make it smell welcoming, but sharp as razor wire and somehow sweet and pungent, like old memories before my life took a sharp turn for the worse. It seemed to be a decision already made, to drink this apparently toxic fluid for sheer somewhat inhuman enjoyment. I took my hand and dipped my finger into the top of the bottle, just catching a small drop of liquid on the tip of my finger. When the satiating white liquid oozed down my throat, I knew it in my burning and aching heart that I needed more. I grabbed a large glass, one that I got from my mother. Just staring at the taunting glassware made me have to push feelings down, somewhere where I would never see them. Never hear a peep from them ever again. I raised the glass, as the feelings that made me human, who I am, were safely tucked away. Never to be seen once again. Pouring it in my mouth, the extraordinary drink made my mouth melt with a burning sensation. Literally. As I felt my insides slowly melt, the star of the show was when my stomach lining fell apart, burning a hole in my internal organs and causing me much agony, but every bit of it was matched with a sensation of which the likes of has never been felt before. Collapsing to the ground, the intense pain causing all my muscles to contract immensely and my brain to halt to an abrupt stop, I was only able to croak out a single measly sentence before my vocal chords disintegrated. I wanted to get the word of my drink out to the world. Thinking took too much time. I could only say one faint word. The name of this beautiful, fiery, delectable, world-ending drink. Bleach.

I've been lurking this subreddit for about 14 months now and have been working arduously to save up for a big investment. I've finally gone ahead with my gut feeling and done "the dirty" last month - buying diamonds.
After all the saving, I have come up with approximately $45k, mostly from my freelance modest-paying job of which is not relevant to this discussion.
Now, this is the real reason I had gone ahead with my decision and purchased my five carat diamond: The rarity. I was at a gala dinner with should I say "high earners". I must say I did feel a little out of place amongst them but the people on my table culminated some quality advice. The way they see it, ever since '04 there has been an ever increasing demand for diamonds - yet little supply on our shores. The Australian population is increasing, not enough people know this, not enough people are willing to invest in a material that is knowingly becoming scarce as the years go by with A HEFTY PRICE INCREASE. The diamond itself also looks stunning (dull off-white colour for those who want to know) and I think my diamond in particular is very enthralling.
However, make sure you see what your purchasing IRL; they can be shifty online and you can manage to accidentally purchase something low grade.
I don't see why there is so much negative stigma associated with purchase brilliant investment.

Am I the only one relentlessly disappointed that the new trilogy even thinks this "grey Jedi" shit is interesting? We get it. Light and Dark need each other to be in balance. That was basically the point of the original trilogy and then beaten to death in the prequels. 

The reason the new trilogy sucks balls already and shows no signs of getting better is that it lacks the insight and subtext that Lucas gave the originals in which the Force was a FUCKING METAPHOR for the struggles of the youth generation in the 1970s. The Clone Wars and the myth of a "good war" was about WW2. The damaged/broken families of the postwar era = Luke's missing parents. The struggle for the hippie generation to come to terms with the compromises and justifications of their parents ("From a certain point of view" etc.) was about restoring hope to a cynical world.

The Force Awakens? Hey kids, look! The Millennium Falcon!! Han Solo!! A robot that's kinda like R2!

By pressing the jump key a second time while in midair, the Scout can perform a second jump in any direction. The extra height and distance this ability grants can be used to access areas which other classes cannot. This can be useful for avoiding enemy fire and ambushing incoming enemies. A careless double jump, however, has an easily predictable trajectory, allowing competent players to make a kill.
It is possible to execute the second jump at any time while in midair. This can be used to negate fall damage by performing the second jump just before hitting the ground.﻿

I know of several people who deliberately whip out their liquid waste tube, miss the toilet and flood the floor with urine... and some who go further and let a poop come partially out of their solid waste tube, before throwing themselves to the left or right and letting it fall down the side of the toilet. 

I wonder if people are doing this as an indirect, underhanded way of getting back at the world for the injustices they may have suffered. 


> *Oh, the Bossman dumped a huge amount of urgent paperwork on my desk today despite knowing full well that I had to leave on time to make it to the hospital in time to see my dying family. Time to poop everywhere.*


I also note that many times, the toilet paper in the stalls are drenched and dripping with liquid waste. Why? Often I wonder if their mindset is:


> *Lol, imagine when the next person comes in here, sits down and begins pooping, and then either puts their hand in the pee-covered tissue paper, or notices and realises that they can't wipe their butts lol.*


I do wonder if some people do it and hide in neighbouring stalls to enjoy the reaction of the next user who comes in and sees the toilet and the paper and the floor covered in liquid waste, or to think of the dismay of the cleaner. It is quite painful to think of, and even worse to experience.

In the movie Minions (2015), we learn that the minions have been alive for multiple centuries serving who they think is the most despicable leader (which means they may have been involved in the Holocaust, but that theory is for another day). Initally, this may lead you to believe that minions simply have long lifespans, but there is solid evidence showing that minions are literal immortal gods, or at least divine gifts from god himself.

For starters, not only have we ever seen adolecent minions, but minions lack reproductive organs and are genderless (although they do use male pronouns). If minions lack the capability to reproduce, wouldn't this mean they would have no need to reproduce, implying that they are immortal?

Another thing is that in Despicable Me 2, the minions are injected with a serum that makes them indestructible killing machines. Although the movie makes it look like the minions are only invincible when injected with the serum, there is a scene in Minions (2015) where the minions Kevin, Stuart, and Bob are being "tortured", although none of the torture methods (Streching, Hanging) are effective aginst minions. Minions are also shown to be able to survive after suffering third degree burns and falling at terminal velocity.

Now, if you don't mind, i'm gonna go worship the minion Bob and sacrifice my first-born son to him. Bye.

there was once a man named Gerald. Gerald loved Naruto, and he especially liked the pink-haired healer named Sakura. he loved Sakura so much that he got himself a Sakura body pillow with a hole right where her vagina should be. one faithful Christmas evening, he decided to fuck his body pillow. "come here, my love~" he chortled. wiping his sweaty fingers in his dandruff-infested hair, he propped up Sakura on his bed. Gerald undressed himself, revealing his hairy penis. he started jacking off, whispering "you're going to get 30 days worth of cum from this sugar daddy..."
eventually, he spurted all over his crusty pillow. then he proceeded to rub his sweaty penis all over the pillow, accidentally peeing a little. "don't mind that, babe..." he groaned. sticking his penis in the hole of the pillow, he started to slam the pillow against his thighs. "oh fuck yes... I'm gonna make you have triplets~" Gerald whispered in a rapey tone. finally reaching orgasm, he filled his stiff pillow with his disgusting cum once more. "honey, cookies are ready!" Gerald's mom called from the foot of the stairs. "fuck you mom, I'm fucking my pillow!" he retorted.

Hentai, otherwise known as Hentaichwondo, is the art of getting hens to fight. It is a national sport with competitors in every country. It isn't as popular as a sport such as football or basketball, but it has it's own merits. Some people compete locally, battling their family hens hoping to win and compete in the big leagues. All the hens need to be able to handle weapons and wear robes. The hens battle with weapons and clothing supplied by their owner, and once a hen cant fight more, the other person is victorious. So here: I urge you to look up Hentai videos, please spread the word of the glorious sport that is Hentaichwondo.

John Doe looked at the cursed teapot in his hands and felt worried.

He walked over to the window and reflected on his beautiful surroundings. He had always loved sunny ROBLOX with its bewildered, blue beaches. It was a place that encouraged his tendency to feel worried.

Then he saw something in the distance, or rather someone. It was the figure of Jane Doe. Jane was a gentle painter with chubby toes and tall fingers.

John gulped. He glanced at his own reflection. He was a friendly, intelligent, bonkers with ample toes and brunette fingers. His friends saw him as an alive, amused angel. Once, he had even made a cup of tea for a spluttering old man.

But not even a friendly person who had once made a cup of tea for a spluttering old man, was prepared for what Jane had in store today.

The rain hammered like bopping puppies, making John Depressed.

As John stepped outside and Jane came closer, he could see the damaged glint in her eye.

Jane gazed with the affection of 2702 charming miniature monkeys. She said, in hushed tones, "You are handsome, please "Play with me." John looked back, even more Depressed and still teapot. "Jane, I lohve you," he replied.

They looked at each other with Sad feelings, like two funny, fragile foxes running at a very noble holiday, which had drum and bass music playing in the background and two lohving uncles swimming to the beat.

John regarded Jane's chubby toes and tall fingers. "I feel the same way!" revealed John with a delighted grin.

Jane looked Emotional, her emotions blushing like a breakable, brainy blade.

Then Jane came inside for a nice glass of water

Adding two instances of the numerical value of two to each other produces the sum of four.
Subtracting one from this sum results in the number three.
I have just demonstrated an example of the study of numbers done in a speedy fashion.

On each passing day the individual is located on the solid cube of hard material.
Ignite large organisms of the plant kingdom on fire and slowly inhale the collection of airborne particulates generated from the combustion.

I watch and observe that individual that identifies as the female gender in the area of natural space set aside for human enjoyment.
After taking everything into consideration I conclude that that particular female is an "uckers".

When the distinct inanimate object generated the sound similar to the sound ducks produce, exactly three times.
You, a male human being, were lowering your body quickly so as to hide yourself.

Human individual that chooses to identify himself as "Azsnee", please wait and do not perform any actions for now.
The fellow person of the male sex is the sole owner of the object I refer to as "pumpee".

Other fellow male human being that I own, please also wait a bit and refrain from doing anything.
The other fellow individual possesses a flat disc-shaped item that can fly long distances in the air when thrown with strength and given a spin.

I proceed to lure an entity into a planted device designed to catch it, three consecutive times.
And I do this on the piece of paved land designed to allow large vehicles to be driven on it.
I transport and set into motion the popular breakfast cereal called "Corn Flakes".

I now randomly mention the name of another well known cereal "Rice Krispies".
Just like I instructed the two previous humans, I also advise you, the person of the female sex that belongs to me, that goes by the name of "Whitney", to stand by and remain in readiness.

While on the paved route I am currently creating ten appendages that typically protrude out of the foot of animals that have feet.
I ask you to please enjoy and be fond of my pedal digits.

You, a masculine adult, held the belief that the water in my body had cooled down and changed its physical state to that of a solid.
I visually perceive a physically attractive female human being which causes me to assume an intentionally seductive body position.

If the said female human is not situated on the thing, then I quickly leave the premises as if I turned into an apparition of a dead person that can appear in the world of the living.
I laugh, but you should also direct your gaze towards the body part responsible for the sense of smell that projects above your mouth.

"Could you please repeat what you said?" I say in a loud manner.
"I choose to equate you with the distal tip of the male sexual organ."
Again, I instruct you to direct your eyes downwards towards the central protruding organ of your face, your nose.

The end-to-end distance of your nose is so long that it can be visually compared to a flexible tube that is used to spray water in a garden.
I now proceed to make an attempt at reproducing the sound that said garden hose makes when active, using my mouth.

I ask you to confirm whether you have in fact succeeded in attaining me.
I try to imitate the sound of a sudden gaseous expansion usually caused by a bomb.
The human person is planning to return back to his internal location.

Could you please divulge your honest opinion on whether you do look on with favor to that?
Also could you please declare whether your bodily senses are perceiving that?

I proclaim that you have in fact done already known all along.
I am visually discerning that your superficial muscles are shaking uncontrollably as if you are frightened.
Please do not react in fear as if you have just witnessed an unexpected event, fellow male member of the Homo sapiens species.
You are currently guaranteed to be safe from any harm, the fact of which is typically referred to as being "protected".
But I also like to add another "ed" syllable at the end of this word.
Affirmative?

I now proceed to mimic the sound produced in a violent explosion.
I present the suggestion that both you and I should depart from the place we're currently residing in.
For a second time I reproduce the sound of a fiery explosion.

Exit the vehicle containing four hinged doorways in one quick maneuver while holding a .44 caliber pistol.
The first four integers in the numeral system were all, in fact, in existence.

The temperature of my body is gradually becoming colder while I'm situated in a long roofed passage inside a building.
The male human individual whose gamete conceived you has been living in this world for at least forty-four years.

This same person is still using a modern telecommunications device to contact another human being and request the artistic production of a picture made with pencil and paper.

Please disclose to your male biological parent what I am about to say next.
As soon as said person falls within my visual field.
I will initiate the action of grabbing and quickly rotating horizontally the mandible bone in the lower part of his face.

I order you to retrieve a chocolate bar going by the name "Twix" belonging to the fellow male individual, using physical violence if necessary.
Please also order this same human to visit an establishment where goods are sold for financial profit, again using physical strength when needed.

The person of the female gender that belongs to you is correctly aware that I have full access to the semi-liquid substance that is typically added to a meal to add flavor.
I do not own any tomato-based condiment however.

It is only the same creamy fluid used for savory dishes that I desire.
This preparation is also pure and not cooked or processed in any way.

Now I'm going to reproduce the sound generated in an explosive blast one more time, say a short slang term used to greet someone or call for attention, and utter the non-existent and meaningless word "gah".

The object without a precise designation, often referred to simply as "thing", but which I pronounce without the letter "h", produces a vast array of sounds that I find very difficult to describe using just the English language. Therefore I am instead going to try to mimic the sounds with my own voice while making convincing gestures using my hands, arms and whole body. The sounds vary from those consisting of just one syllable to more complicated ones that require me to move and slide my tongue along the roof of my mouth very quickly and repeatedly. Some of the sounds resemble those caused by bullet-firing weapons while others are similar to explosive detonations. However, some people would say that they are actually unintelligible words and would classify them as gibberish. I have to admit that one of the reasons I am in fact making all these sounds is to produce a humorous effect by intentionally emphasizing the ridiculousness of it all.

I again repeat the fact that you have done already known.
As a unique individual I choose to identify myself using the name "Big Shaq".

Now I proceed to utter multiple monosyllables that start with the letter "y".

I'd like to inform you that there is a process of rapid oxidation of flammable material under way right now, which is releasing a significant amount of heat and light.
This is happening in the small compartment we are currently inside, and I choose to inform you of this exactly three times.

Could you confirm if you do in fact acquire me?
The male individual belonging to the Homo sapiens species has a temperature value which is not so high that it would cause him discomfort.

I explain this fact to the fellow female person by saying, "The male human does not in fact have a high degree of heat."
Again, I repeat the same thing to the same female, "The individual of the male sex is not perceiving a sensation of great bodily heat."

The human being identifying herself as the female gender requested me to remove my thick outer garment from my body.

I replied to her by saying, "Informal term that literally means a very young toddler but is typically used to describe a good looking female human person, the male individual is in fact not feeling as if his internal body temperature has a significantly high value."

I then proceed to shout "The human being of the male sex cannot ever have a high enough temperature that could cause a sensation similar to that of burning, not now or any other time in the future."

I will now say the formal term that describes the bodily process wherein fluid is produced by sweat glands in the skin of most mammals and is then left to evaporate, with the result of heat being dissipated off the animal's body.
I have also decided to add the slang term "ting" right after.

Next, I will mention the name of the brand "Lynx" that, among other products, manufactures several types of deodorants which are used to cut down on the unpleasant body odors that can be caused by excessive sweating.
I will also say the English word that describes a change which is a result of a previously performed action

You know what, amigo? I'll give you the benefit of the doubt. Maybe you don't know how long I've been on Reddit, but take a guess. It's a long time. Lemme check right now, dot fucking dot dot... 7 years. I've been on Reddit for mother fucking *7* years. How old are you? Are you even that old yet? Nah, I'm gonna assume you're old enough. I'll give you the benefit of the doubt. You seem cognizant enough not to be some simpleton CoD-playing 7 year old. So let's move on. I've been on Reddit for 7 *fucking* years, and guess how long I average per day. I had an internet timer for about 3 years in the middle, and it was 5 hours per day. That's right, [5 fucking hours per day.](https://i.imgur.com/IdNwDH4.jpg) That's 12,775 hours. What have you done for that long besides jerked off in your mom's panties? You think this is a fucking game to me? You think you're talking to some whelp Reddit noob that's about to back down to your shit-talking? Well guess what, I'm not about to back down, you worthless tripe-guzzling gutter slut. If you think I'm joking about the things I say, you have no idea what power is held by ideology. This shit permeates everything we do and builds up in your mind like the fucking fluoride that's blocking your mind's eye from understanding my basic 10th grade logic. So if you've got something to say to me, say it directly, because I refuse to respond to these back-handed comments about my character. If you choose not to listen, so fucking what. It's A-nother Knight Alone. Peace.

I was on the train 🚊 watching a video with my iPhone X and AirPods and a guy 👨 behind me taps my shoulder. 

**him**: do you like it? was it worth it?

**me**: i'm liking it. 

He gives me a smirk 😏 and pulls out a space grey iPhone X box from a white apple bag. Looks like he had come back from buying one. I give him a nod and a thumbs up 👍 while mouthing 👅 "nice" and went back to my movie 🎥 . He was me.

Everyone on the train 🚊 started clapping 👏.

Ok. So get this. Playing Fallout 4 right?
 I have this quest to track down this Kellogg’s frosted flakes nigga right?
 So of COURSE they make me use DogShit to track his ass down. 
 From the beginning i new he was gonna get me killed. Cuz he just stupidly walks into trouble and doesnt give me the chance to do proper Recon. Right. 
 So he led us in this hole of the building. Which looked like it was a small garage. And the entry way is blocked. So nowhere to go. 
 So my bitch lasagna companion is like. Aight he led us here. Now send him off. 
 So i try to do that. 
 I talk to DogTurds to tell his ass off. And it gives me the usual options. Go here trade cancel. And then the 4th... was to ask him if somethings wrong. 
 So i ask feces pup that option. And my chick asks. "Is something the matter boy?" 
 His ONLY response. Was to wimper and whine. He cowers back and kicks me out of the convorsation. Only for me to hear these repetitive beeps getting louder snd louder. 
 Sure as shit. I turn around. To see this suicider approaching and he pretty much gave my ass the dicking of a lifetime and the moral of the story is fuck that dumbass dog.

家の中のコリー, or as it’s called by its unfaithful Disney dub, Cory in the House, is a truly an absolute and completely incredible experience to every part of the brain, it has such complex and intricate characters, witch have had countless studies done to even comprehend how Cory and company are deeper than the challenger deep at the bottom of the Marisa trench, and the plot lines spanning millions of years and multiple dementions. Not to mention the amazing manga it was based off of, イム・レイク, (I’m so raven for the uncultured swine who only watch dubs) which is comparable, but was only a stepping stone for Dennis Rinsler and Marc Warren. イム・レイク often overshadows it’s much grander and deep counterpart, which is truly sad. The worst part is that Obama censored Cory in the house because of its communist undertones, and heavily edited it to appeal to capitalist America, and if Cory was not censored, the Americas, in fact the free world, would be freed from the grimps of capitalism

To be fair, you have to have a very high IQ to understand Big Shaq. The humour is extremely subtle, and without a solid grasp of grime rap most of the lyrics will go over a typical listener’s head. There’s also Shaq’s nihilistic outlook, which is deftly woven into his characterisation- his personal philosophy draws heavily from Narodnaya Volya literature, for instance. The fans understand this stuff; they have the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate the depths of these lyrics, to realise that they’re not just funny- they say something deep about LIFE. As a consequence people who dislike Biq Shaq truly ARE idiots- of course they wouldn’t appreciate, for instance, the humour in Shaq’s existential catchphrase “The ting goes skrrra,” which itself is a cryptic reference to Turgenev’s Russian epic Fathers and Sons. I’m smirking right now just imagining one of those addlepated simpletons scratching their heads in confusion as Biq Shaq’s genius wit unfolds itself on their television screens. What fools.. how I pity them. 😂

And yes, by the way, i DO have a Biq Shaq tattoo. And no, you cannot see it. It’s for the ladies’ eyes only- and even then they have to demonstrate that they’re within 5 IQ points of my own (preferably lower) beforehand. Nothin personnel kid 😎

I actually had a dream like this once. It started off as a legitimately normal dream, ya know?
But suddenly I was able to zoom in. So I zoomed in to the carpet. Into the strings, into the fibers, into the molecules, atoms, protons. The quarks. I got excited because this is where science fails us. Whats passed this?
It seemed to be a surface, as I get close to it it's flat.
And to my surprise and panic, it seems to be a never ending expanse of memes.
I shit you not. All the memes I think I've ever seen on Reddit - for as far as my eyes can see.
I remember the sheer panic I had, looking at this, it seemed no matter how far in I looked or how much I zoomed in, THOSE memes were made of MORE memes.
I woke up soon after and vowed never to question my reality again.

Life sure is hard. People make choices. People betray other people. People take advantage of other people, use them, abuse them, then throw them away. Sometimes though, the "victims" were asking for it, well, kind of... I mean, the signs are there; hell, the signs are always there. Psychology today has easy reads, available to everybody, your average John knows how to read body stance, eye language and all that jazz. Your regular Jack of all trades knows people well by now and how to read them, read between the lines and all that. But heart interferes with mind's footwork and regularly blinds the eye.
 
Some people believe lies others feed them with, because they want to, even if they know those are fake and smell like a trap, ulterior motive, etc. Or because said other people live in a life full of lies anyway, so they wrongly assumed that said lies, would be those people's truths... Alas, things are never so simple as black and white, yin and yang. There is that middle ground too, that faceless, colorless, emotionless, calm, still surface, between the two extremes (love and hate). Something i always coveted, something i see most people happily or pretending-ly (and indifferently) sit cozily inside it, something i never seem to gain access to. I regularly find myself among and inside extremes and all this strain leaves me a mess, a wreck, each and every time. Of course, even if other people are in the wrong, the fault is only mine, because responsibility lies solely with those possessing perception, knowledge and naturally, "power" (in this case, to endure "heavy hits").
 
How can you stop yourself from feeling for and wanting to believe, be there for others by their side? Especially in important situations with impact to your life? How can someone be indifferent to others, with mentality and disposition like: "They are not with us, so they are against us", or "their choice, let them drown and pay the consequences"? While i am far from a samaritan and i could never become a martyr, or reach the epitome of self sacrifice (which is, "love thy enemy"), i regularly find myself unable to deal with others, with the "to each their own" creed. And i end up hurting myself, as well as "sabotaging" it, for the sake of... Others. Especially in important relationships and stuff; which not surprisingly, were important only from my own perspective, feeling and more precisely, hope/desire, not of the receiving party of my best self's performance and efforts to please them.
 
Residing in the extremes is not a light burden and i obviously would rather reside in the middle ground, the "fine balance". Mostly, to keep myself outside of "harm". In an era when poverty, combined with greed, makes people become very different than they used to be, undertake choices hard to blame them for given the circumstances and the pretext, where and when almost everybody follows the "every man for himself", it is almost mandatory to seek to protect and safeguard your own self, above all things, first and foremost and this, usually involves ignoring and not really caring, about others. Doubly so, when they give you signs aplenty, of their true self and future events' unraveling. What is the secret of being indifferent to those who are indifferent to you? What is the secret of resisting other people's arsenal of social skills and charms? How to disconnect heart from mind? How to judge others based on facts, VS hopes and trying to change them?

Adding two instances of the numerical value of two to each other produces the sum of four.
Subtracting one from this sum results in the number three.
I have just demonstrated an example of the study of numbers done in a speedy fashion.

On each passing day the individual is located on the solid cube of hard material.
Ignite large organisms of the plant kingdom on fire and slowly inhale the collection of airborne particulates generated from the combustion.

I watch and observe that individual that identifies as the female gender in the area of natural space set aside for human enjoyment.
After taking everything into consideration I conclude that that particular female is an "uckers".

When the distinct inanimate object generated the sound similar to the sound ducks produce, exactly three times.
You, a male human being, were lowering your body quickly so as to hide yourself.

Human individual that chooses to identify himself as "Azsnee", please wait and do not perform any actions for now.
The fellow person of the male sex is the sole owner of the object I refer to as "pumpee".

Other fellow male human being that I own, please also wait a bit and refrain from doing anything.
The other fellow individual possesses a flat disc-shaped item that can fly long distances in the air when thrown with strength and given a spin.

I proceed to lure an entity into a planted device designed to catch it, three consecutive times.
And I do this on the piece of paved land designed to allow large vehicles to be driven on it.
I transport and set into motion the popular breakfast cereal called "Corn Flakes".

I now randomly mention the name of another well known cereal "Rice Krispies".
Just like I instructed the two previous humans, I also advise you, the person of the female sex that belongs to me, that goes by the name of "Whitney", to stand by and remain in readiness.

While on the paved route I am currently creating ten appendages that typically protrude out of the foot of animals that have feet.
I ask you to please enjoy and be fond of my pedal digits.

You, a masculine adult, held the belief that the water in my body had cooled down and changed its physical state to that of a solid.
I visually perceive a physically attractive female human being which causes me to assume an intentionally seductive body position.

If the said female human is not situated on the thing, then I quickly leave the premises as if I turned into an apparition of a dead person that can appear in the world of the living.
I laugh, but you should also direct your gaze towards the body part responsible for the sense of smell that projects above your mouth.

"Could you please repeat what you said?" I say in a loud manner.
"I choose to equate you with the distal tip of the male sexual organ."
Again, I instruct you to direct your eyes downwards towards the central protruding organ of your face, your nose.

The end-to-end distance of your nose is so long that it can be visually compared to a flexible tube that is used to spray water in a garden.
I now proceed to make an attempt at reproducing the sound that said garden hose makes when active, using my mouth.

I ask you to confirm whether you have in fact succeeded in attaining me.
I try to imitate the sound of a sudden gaseous expansion usually caused by a bomb.
The human person is planning to return back to his internal location.

Could you please divulge your honest opinion on whether you do look on with favor to that?
Also could you please declare whether your bodily senses are perceiving that?

I proclaim that you have in fact done already known all along.
I am visually discerning that your superficial muscles are shaking uncontrollably as if you are frightened.
Please do not react in fear as if you have just witnessed an unexpected event, fellow male member of the Homo sapiens species.
You are currently guaranteed to be safe from any harm, the fact of which is typically referred to as being "protected".
But I also like to add another "ed" syllable at the end of this word.
Affirmative?

I now proceed to mimic the sound produced in a violent explosion.
I present the suggestion that both you and I should depart from the place we're currently residing in.
For a second time I reproduce the sound of a fiery explosion.

Exit the vehicle containing four hinged doorways in one quick maneuver while holding a .44 caliber pistol.
The first four integers in the numeral system were all, in fact, in existence.

The temperature of my body is gradually becoming colder while I'm situated in a long roofed passage inside a building.
The male human individual whose gamete conceived you has been living in this world for at least forty-four years.

This same person is still using a modern telecommunications device to contact another human being and request the artistic production of a picture made with pencil and paper.

Please disclose to your male biological parent what I am about to say next.
As soon as said person falls within my visual field.
I will initiate the action of grabbing and quickly rotating horizontally the mandible bone in the lower part of his face.

I order you to retrieve a chocolate bar going by the name "Twix" belonging to the fellow male individual, using physical violence if necessary.
Please also order this same human to visit an establishment where goods are sold for financial profit, again using physical strength when needed.

The person of the female gender that belongs to you is correctly aware that I have full access to the semi-liquid substance that is typically added to a meal to add flavor.
I do not own any tomato-based condiment however.

It is only the same creamy fluid used for savory dishes that I desire.
This preparation is also pure and not cooked or processed in any way.

Now I'm going to reproduce the sound generated in an explosive blast one more time, say a short slang term used to greet someone or call for attention, and utter the non-existent and meaningless word "gah".

The object without a precise designation, often referred to simply as "thing", but which I pronounce without the letter "h", produces a vast array of sounds that I find very difficult to describe using just the English language. Therefore I am instead going to try to mimic the sounds with my own voice while making convincing gestures using my hands, arms and whole body. The sounds vary from those consisting of just one syllable to more complicated ones that require me to move and slide my tongue along the roof of my mouth very quickly and repeatedly. Some of the sounds resemble those caused by bullet-firing weapons while others are similar to explosive detonations. However, some people would say that they are actually unintelligible words and would classify them as gibberish. I have to admit that one of the reasons I am in fact making all these sounds is to produce a humorous effect by intentionally emphasizing the ridiculousness of it all.

I again repeat the fact that you have done already known.
As a unique individual I choose to identify myself using the name "Big Shaq".

Now I proceed to utter multiple monosyllables that start with the letter "y".

I'd like to inform you that there is a process of rapid oxidation of flammable material under way right now, which is releasing a significant amount of heat and light.
This is happening in the small compartment we are currently inside, and I choose to inform you of this exactly three times.

Could you confirm if you do in fact acquire me?
The male individual belonging to the Homo sapiens species has a temperature value which is not so high that it would cause him discomfort.

I explain this fact to the fellow female person by saying, "The male human does not in fact have a high degree of heat."
Again, I repeat the same thing to the same female, "The individual of the male sex is not perceiving a sensation of great bodily heat."

The human being identifying herself as the female gender requested me to remove my thick outer garment from my body.

I replied to her by saying, "Informal term that literally means a very young toddler but is typically used to describe a good looking female human person, the male individual is in fact not feeling as if his internal body temperature has a significantly high value."

I then proceed to shout "The human being of the male sex cannot ever have a high enough temperature that could cause a sensation similar to that of burning, not now or any other time in the future."

I will now say the formal term that describes the bodily process wherein fluid is produced by sweat glands in the skin of most mammals and is then left to evaporate, with the result of heat being dissipated off the animal's body.
I have also decided to add the slang term "ting" right after.

Next, I will mention the name of the brand "Lynx" that, among other products, manufactures several types of deodorants which are used to cut down on the unpleasant body odors that can be caused by excessive sweating.
I will also say the English word that describes a change which is a result of a previously performed action.

I don't know why people think I got burned.
I said he messed up the lore. He took my words, made them into a straw man then set that alight. I point this all out, yet some people are all too busy stroking each other's dicks to understand that I agreed that my theory doesn't even matter a little bit. All of those cackling users, who are so quick to jump on their little wanktrain, have all at some point or another said words to the effect of Scott ruining the story.
Did the last two years not happen, or did some of you develop an instant mental disorder? I mean, I may be disagnosed aspergic, but the gleeful squees of self-righteousness from some users on here is a spectacle I could never even imagine measuring up to. I could only dream of being that autistic. You're all putting me to shame, darlings. I can only dream to be so mentally handicapped as some users here are behaving RE my talk with Scott.
Just, I'm beside myself in confusion here. How did I get burned? I agreed with his point. My theory should not be catered to, yes. I never pushed it as the one true theory at any point. The best argument you could make for anything nearing that is my whole-hearted rejection of the Dream theory, which may I remind everyone here, most of you sheep considered that a legitimate theory at some point here. If you're all going to screech about my being burned, perhaps actually show me where I got burned? All I see that's burning is Scott's straw man of my position, which I reject completely.
To laugh at me is to laugh at anyone who dare critiques Holy Lord Scott's storytelling, which not a single one of you can say you've never done. I stand in awe of these people who think somehow I lost in some fantastical way to Scott, over theory validation? You do all know the founding principles of my site, do you? That never magically change between now and the site's founding. The timeline itself has been almost useless with how restrained I've been RE placements in the timeline, with the site never even officially favouring 83 or 87.

I'd write out a proper response, but at this point you don't deserve one, nor do I think you'd even listen to it. You're a garbage human being, Kizzy. I just want you to know that.
Maybe stick to circle-jerking on your own website Kizzylore from now on.

I don’t accept that Bubbleman has won against me. Even if he will win against me, because he never faced me at my best. While I always faced him at his best. That’s not competition. That’s not a tourney match that’s supposed to happen. I do not accept that I’ve lost to him, only fools would see it that way. At my best I am amazing, possibly more amazing than he is, but until that happens I have not lost.

Dating a woman
Fucking WHY?
Dolphins are capable of manipulating their vaginal muscles in order to provide maximum pleasure. Most women cannot
Dolphins secrete a substance that dramatically shortens your refractory period as long as your dick remains in her vagina. Women cannot
Dolphins cannot cheat on you as they do not form lasting, intimate relationships. Women can, and not only can, but they enjoy doing it
Dolphins do not mind if you fuck another dolphin. A women will hate you if you fuck another women
Dolphins don't mind if you cum inside either. She won't force you to pay child support for 18 years like a women. She can't even get pregnant
Dolphins won't leave you for another dolphin with more shekels. Dolphins do not have a system of currency and are not consumer whores like women
If you are the submissive type, dolphins can be aggressive, and far more convincingly aggressive, not like a 140 pound bitch who won't scare anyone
Dolphins do not expect you to spend exorbitant amounts of shekels on them
Dolphins give it up easily
Dolphins do not demand superior rights to men
Dolphins do not organize Dolphinwalks
You can ride a dolphin through the ocean
Dolphins are more intelligent then women
Dolphins are clearly superior to any human woman of any race.
So why haven't you fucked a dolphin yet?

To be fair, you have to have a very high IQ to understand SpongeBob. The humor is extremely subtle, and without a solid grasp of marine biology most of the jokes will go over a typical viewer's head. There's also SpongeBob's joyful outlook, which is deftly woven into his characterisation - his personal philosophy draws heavily from Dr. Seuss literature, for instance. The fans understand this stuff; they have the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate the depths of these jokes, to realize that they're not just funny- they say something deep about LIFE. As a consequence people who dislike SpongeBob truly ARE idiots- of course they wouldn't appreciate, for instance, the humour in SpongeBob's existencial catchphrase "I'm ready," which itself is a cryptic reference to people looking for jobs in the Great Depression, I'm smirking right now just imagining one of those pin-headed simpletons scratching their heads in confusion as Stephen Hillenburg's  genius unfolds itself on their television screens. What fools... how I pity them. 😂 And yes by the way, I DO have a SpongeBob tattoo. And no, you cannot see it. It's for the ladies' eyes only- And even they have to demonstrate that they're within 5 IQ points of my own (preferably lower) beforehand

Capitalism implicitly acknowledges that everyone's amoral and self-serving, but strives to create a system whereby these selfish impulses are channelled for societal good. A businessman may screw over his family and associates while amassing wealth, but he still contributes to society by employing people and paying taxes.

Capitalism perfectly complements godless atheism. A capitalist society must commit all cardinal sins to succeed. Lust for wealth, Envy for a neighbor's new car, and feeling Proud of your successful business are all Cardinal sins but Capitalist virtues.

Christianity teaches you to "love your neighbor as yourself". The communist slogan of "From each according to his ability, to each according to his needs" is merely a rewording of this Christian notion. Other Christian virtues like Fortitude (no heating this winter), Temperance (make do with your rations), Diligence (work 14 hour shifts) and blind obedience to your superiors should work well under Communism.

Practically however, Communists are Atheists and Capitalists (especially Republicans) are Bible-thumpers. How did this come about?

Gyms can be the same way. Me and my workout buddy, Felipe, were in the midst of a particularly arduous set at our local gym not too long ago. Just covered in sweat and getting a good pump on. A couple of meathead gym rats happened to be nearby, no doubt drawn in by our grunting and moaning. Well, they took issue with the way the two of us were doing squat thrusts. Said our form was all wrong. According to to them, squat thrusts are not meant to be done in tandem, with your workout buddy, while listening to Luther Vandross. Also, you're not supposed to do them while in the spoon position with your workout buddy, not even if you take turns being big spoon and little spoon.

I wasn't having any of it. I hiked my yoga pants up and told them that's how I was taught by my Uncle Steve when I was a kid. Furthermore, Steve probably knows the proper way to execute a squat thrust seeing as how he went to the Olympics once. Those meatheads laughed and said Uncle Steve wouldn't know a squat thrust if Tony Little himself did one directly on his head. I then invited them to do squat thrusts on my head. Either concurrently or simultaneously, whatever their pleasure. I had no preference either way.

That went on for awhile. I'm not sure who suggested it first, but the whole ordeal turned into a complete dick measuring contest. I do mean that literally. Figured it as the only way to truly prove which party was correct. Easy enough, right? Wrong.

First off, it took forever to come to any kind of consensus on how to even do the calculations. Some thought measurements taken while erect were all that should be considered. Others felt those taken while flaccid were the true measure of a man. The length versus girth debate got real ugly.

Eventually, we came to a compromise: withering dicks, post climaxonly. And each were ranked based on how much coconut water they could displace. This worked for awhile, but then there were rumblings that some participants were using PED's (penile enhancing drugs) to gain an unfair competitive edge. This led to mass debates on ethics and sportsmanship. That was the point when I decided things had simply gotten too ridickulous for me. Felipe and me left that gym shortly afterward. Took our business to Curves instead. Less dick measures there, for obvious reasons. And more acceptance of yoga pants, too.

A lot of the issues with Japanese men turning to virtual women has nothing to do with masturbation. They work incredibly long hours, and are expected to go out drinking with their coworkers nightly. They simply don’t have time for the emotional labor that comes with a real relationship. They’re miserable, isolated, and drained. Virtual women don’t carry the same complexities, though. They’ll love you unconditionally, say “welcome home! I missed you!”, etc. 

It’s an extremely sad situation where the pressure of their work lives are isolating them entirely. Even married men(like this man) could easily become burned out and unable to perform the emotional labor that comes with a real relationship. 

It’s heartbreaking how incredibly sad and lonely and stressed these people are. They deserve our sympathy. It isn’t about masturbation or the commodification of women, it’s about crushing loneliness and the overwhelming responsibilities that forced them into that corner. 

They don’t deserve to be used as a “gotcha” against masturbation when that’s *not even a little bit what their situation is about*

Why did I leak the leak?

To be frank, ICIJ released Paradise pretty fast - I wasn't expecting it for a while. With all of the implications swirling around the Russia investigation etc. it seemed like a good opportunity to tell some of the folks interested in these kinds of things to keep their hopes up.

What is my involvement with Paradise?

Not much, but I will say that I'm in a position that allowed me to have in-depth knowledge of it before it was released.

Any other things you want to share with us?

I don't have much else, but there are rumors swirling about the Don himself...hmm...

Also, has anybody noticed the Japanese Prime Minister is looking a little tired lately?

I think the open woman hate is for the same reasons there's gore on /b/ and swastikas on /pol/ (until /pol/ discovered Hitler really was right): it acts as 'chemo' which keeps normies/outsiders out. Much of meme magic and the structure of autistic havens online is deeply woven with these psychological elements/traps. It is almost an open secret society now. 2008 /b/ grew up and started doing culture warfare and psy-ops better than the CIA. 

Don't take my word for it though, I'm just a crazy wizard posting from the darknet. I still flip shit when I see the chans leak out on TV. I have both ridden and memed from the tip of the spear. Election 2016 couldn't have been more glorious!

be Zeke
be 16
watching Kojo masturbate for first time in a long time
Luther starts watching it too
Luther says "its awesome"
even though its halfway through
parents come in the room
they turn off the tv while we were watching Kojo masturbate
I get mad
I yell at my parents
Luther joins in too
Parents say "we're both grounded"
They send us to our room
before we're halfway up the stairs
there was a big boom
Kojo, fully aroused and naked, come barging to the door
The whole room fills with the aroma of turkey jerky
Kojo sees my parents still yelling at us
Kojo turns on the t.v, seeing himself masturbating
Kojo rips my dad's head off
starts fucking my dad's head viciously
mom gives out a blood curdling scream
mom runs to the phone
Kojo does a major ollie, with a kick flip, and lands in front of my mom before she picks up the phone
Kojo, then, shoves a strip of turkey jerky down her throat, then shoving his dick in there so the jerky could go down easily
mom dies, after choking on turkey jerky and Kojo's sperm
Kojo looks at us
"taek ur shirts off"
Me and Luther take off our shirts
we're just standing there, stunned
Kojo yells "GET UR ARSES DOWN 'ERE"
We do
Kojo tells us to bend over
we bend over
Kojo puts his big, meaty, cock in our assholes
Sure the pain was excrutiating, but it was pleasurable
Kojo gives out a big scream, giving out an orgasm
Sure, it was painful, but the orgasm was something to remember
He goes to Luther, who does the same thing as I did
Kojo orders us to suck on his dick
We do
Kojo orders us to fuck each other
We had to, since we both shared a love for Kojo, even though Luther started loving Kojo just today
Kojo tells me to get my brother pregnant
so he rips off Luther’s cock, but my brother enjoyed the pain
it was like incsest, except Luther was enjoying my cock inside his brand new vagina
Kojo ejaculates on our backs, its white slime was warm
so warm that I ejaculated as the slime tingled my backs
me and Luther get tired
the room was covered with the aroma of sex, combined with Turkey Jerky
we all are lying in a pool of blood, dicks, jizz, slime, and Turkey Jerky
Kojo gets up and leaves
before he leaves he whispers
"Where are all of my Female ladies?"
Me and Luther will never feel the same feeling like that ever again
Kojo is Love
Kojo Is Life

Oh so you don't think that the working class should be emancipated from the chains of enslavement brought upon them by the bourgeois Illuminati lizard elite? Look, if I could invent a time machine and send you back to 1940s Germany I would, Dylan. But I don't own the means of time machine production so how could I. but anyway, the point is I would suck Karl Marx's dick if he were alive today, seeing as he is not I'll just have to make do with Castro #sizedoesntmatter. You won't be calling me a triggered snowflake when Antifa seizes the means of production and brings almighty Marx's classless utopia into existence!!! HOW YOU WILL TREMBLE AT THE MIGHT OF THE WORKING CLASS!!!! [*Hail Marx*] Oh how I will laugh with enormous vigour and enthusiasm when I read your whiny post on some forum sitebook about how you are being oppressed by some anarcho-chomskian goons who have kidnapped you and your family and are making you hit yourself and saying to you "stop hitting yourself. Stop hitting yourself. Typical capitalist pigs, always hitting themselves" and I will just be reclining in the my arm chair reading through your pleas for help, thinking "hahaha if only Marx could see our society today! What progress we have made in emancipating the working class!". Dylan. Well see look here, there is still time for you to renounce your far-right liberalist, free-speech-loving pacifism and not be slaughtered like the enslaved capitalist sheep you are, but instead just be starved to death by famine like every other utopia loving working class gentleman. Can't we all just agree to want a better life? Without Gender pronouns? Without people who disagree? Without being oppressed by the homosexual bourgeois elite? Is that too much to ask? I don't think so.

Consider, for example,

Pikachu Sashimi.

 



A delicate dish, high in protein and very low in fat. Extreme caution, however, must be taken to fully remove the electric shock organ to avoid poisoning. 

Serves: 10

Work Time: 30 minutes.

Total Time: 60 minutes.



10 pound pikachu, freshly butchered.

3 cups soy sauce

3 cups hot Japanese horseradish (green wasabe)


For the excision, one must take special care to use only wooden or stone utensils or chopsticks to avoid short circuits. The meat, when very freshly prepared, causes ones extremities to tingle for several hours due to the mild neurotoxicity of the meat.

Using a very sharp obsidian knife (NO METAL), filet the pikachu by making an incision along the sternum and then along the base of the rib cage. The filet will pull away from the rib cage exposing the electric shock organ immediately beneath the rib cage: do not touch! Take care NOT to puncture this organ.

Chill the filet chilled for 30 minutes and slice thinly. Serve on platter decorated with green onion or red carnations.

Best served with soy sauce mixed one to one with hot Japanese horseradish (wasabe). Each serving: About 400 calories, 90 g protein, 8 g carbohydrate, 1 g total fat , 16 mg cholesterol, 585 mg sodium.

Another example:

I hate to admit it but you’re right. I was watching episode 8 of season 3 and suddenly they were sat in front of the interdimensional television. They began watching a show in which big game hunters began shooting at a House. My friend pointed out to me that this was a reference to house hunters. I broke down. I realized that everything the Internet has been telling us is right. People are born into groups. Those smart enough to understand the subtle jokes in Rick and Morty, and those like me. All I can do is continue to watch and pray that one day they will click. I am inferior.

"The /pol/yp sees the Middle East culture and despises it for the most inane reasons, when in reality it recreates it in it's entirety. This comes as a natural consequence of shallow skin-deep beings that focus more on skin color than culture, tribalism at an animal level like the poor beasts they are, incapable of understanding human nature in it's fullest.

The /pol/yp regards his political views as a moral guide book to dictate the actions of everyone in an objective way, never stopping for a moment how akin to a religion\cult they actually are. There are holy texts (inforgraphs, Mein Kampf) and sins (be born the wrong race\gender\culture\religion), Gods you must worship (Hitler, Trump) and eternal damnation awaits you if you don't agree with that (Day of the Rope) Especially wicked and strange is the regression of Christian culture, back to the Dark Age with their inquisition-like views on how to enforce it, as if the Enlightnement was a mistake for them. Of course, in the end their form of Christianity ends up being akin to Islam. A religion that serves only to enforce the rules they believe society should run on, something that takes precedence over even worshiping their God. A religion that must be spread as far as possible and to everyone, by force even if necessary for all those that would oppose it are clearly wicked evil men that need your help or death.

Because of this, the /pol/yp will never stay still in his own containment chamber. He will always travel and infiltrate every community possible to proselytize (redpill) their culture. Anyone that protests against that kind of discussion is a khaffir (/leftypol/) and only does so because he is evil and wicked. The community that the /pol/yp joins might have it's own culture and they are allowed to keep it so long as it doesn't interfere with the /pol/yp's own culture.

Odds are, that's not the case as his culture is one of fighting and struggling and therefore he will always try to find something he can fight and struggle against, ruining every aspect of culture where he joins as everything becomes offensive to some degree. When he is done, he moves on to another place, already having "redpilled" that community.

Despite all of the similarities, the /pol/yp will vehemently deny any similarity to Islam and in one thing he has a point. Islam is a warrior's religion in the sense that it serves the purpose of creating a caste of warriors that fight to protect their homeland and expand it. Of course, in the current days this doesn't see much use by Islam with the exception of terrorists and therefore their religion leads to a terrible state of affairs in their own countries, full of men bred for war with none to join.

Meanwhile, the White Sharia of /pol/ serves a different purpose. Proselytizing and spreading it is just a means to an end, that end being the increase in their ego and sense of self-worth.

Unable to achieve anything on their own except loud amounts of shitposting, the only thing they have going for them is a sense of superiority over the rest of the world. The idea that they are "right" and this can only exist as long as they talk about it and force it on everyone else.

Why strive to be a better person when you can just ascertain that you are the better person in the room? Especially when you surround yourself by like-minded individuals who agree with you and enforce the idea that everyone else is terrible, therefore making you better in comparison? The next time you see /pol/yps invading a board and complaining about something they don't like, think of Sharia Laws in London, with muslims going inside pubs and telling patrons not to drink beer.

They believe they are right and are just trying to help you meet their God. But do they really have the right to push their culture on you?"

Uhm, ok. What was the point of this comment exactly? I mean, I get it. You like their comment and feel happy. You realized something incredible! Mindblowing. And you want to express that. I've had those times as well... let's face it, it's a normal form of communication. But, your inane comment simply adds nothing of value to the conversation. What does this do? Does it make you feel old to be part of the team? Does it make you happy to say that you're following his thought patterns? Is this really what you want out of Life?

Contribute to conversation - to society, my friend. Don't be a follower, be a leader.

Is this the only rat-human relationship that allows for complete control via hair or can any rat learn to use this technique to control any human with hair? Does this mean that the rats of new york can emerge and enslave all humans, becoming the dominant species by using their human vessels to fuel their parasitic lifestyle?

Your dad jerks off dogs. He gets down on his knees and crawls through the dogs piss and shit and snuggles up to the dog, his fingers tracing along it's belly until he finds it's cock. He begins tugging and stroking as his penis moistens, his balls swelling and his dick begin to stick out like an eraser on a fresh #2 pencil. He grunts with satisfaction as the dog begins eagerly thrusting into his hand, his grip now tightening to maintain control of the dog’s greasy red cock. He lowers his head to watch the cock work in his hand, groans with satisfaction and begins working his own dick with his other muddy hand, his hips gyrating with the rhythm of the dog’s thrusting.

"Oh fucking jesus god yes.." he gasps. He changes positions, still maintaining control of the feverishly thrusting cock as the dog’s squealing intensifies. He leans forward and with his lips almost touching the dog’s ear, he whispers your name and begins to shudder. He turns his attention again to the dogs swollen member rocking in his hand. He presses it between his hand and his face, the dog thrusting it against his cheeks as he drools. With a massive grunt and a high pitched yelp, the dog’s balls explode, beginning a massive shower of hot, sour puppy jizz. You father cups one hand under the fountain of steaming genetic material gathering it in his hand as the thrusting comes to an end. The canine shudders and begins to walk to the bowl of food in the corner of it's dog-house, but your dad tackles it to the ground. He lifts it's tail and smears the handful of doggy load into the dogs own fetid butthole, turning flakes of crusty dog shit into a dogshit-dogjizz mud slop on the dogs ass. Now he tilts his head to the sky and screams your name, not once, not twice, but three times. He slams his face full force into the dog’s butthole and it's wreath of shitsemen pudding, his tongue machine gun flicking the rim and then burying itself to the hilt inside the dog’s hot colon. Your biological father works his tongue around the inside of the dog’s ass, and then as a few incoherent syllables escaped his now brown lips, spurts of male ejaculate spurt from his pulsating penis. Exhausted, he collapses in the mud, rolls over onto his back, and lights a cigarette. He takes one long drag, looks again to the sky, and speaks your name one last time before he drifts off to sleep.

That's your dad. Your dad does that.

When you type, "Hey..." and it autocorrects to:

"SPONGEBOB, ME LAD, YOU HAVE TOO MANY ORIFICES FER YER OWN GOOD. YER GETTIN' A PROMOTION!" said Mr. Krabs as his hard red carapaced cock jabbed into the back of Spongebob's head.

"I feel like I'm absorbing some weird fluid," spluttered Spongebob as Krabs' nasty crustaceo-jizz poured from his mouth, nose and eyes.

"NOW EARN YOUR KEEP, LANDLUBBER," said Krabs as he grabbed Spongebob by his jizz-soaked trousers and began using him to clean the floor.

"Oh Mr. Krabs, I-"

"CALL ME MASTER YE BITCH"

Krabs stepped down hard in Spongebob and a puddle of his own jizz began spreading radially on the floor of the Krusty Krab.

"Hurgghbglbgblblgbl."

"CHOKE ON IT, YE INVERTEBRATE, OR I CAN'T GET HARRRRRRD. THESE CLAWS AREN'T JUST GOOD FER MATIN…OH, WAIT, YES THEY ARE," said Krabs as he caressed his eleventh leg.

The jizz began floating up toward the ceiling as Krabs brandished his seven-inch red masthead. You have to realize this is to scale, so it was about twice his body size.

Anyway, Squidward burst into the room wearing only a gimp suit and a tutu.

"TAKE ME MASTER, I NEED TO BE HUMILIATED," he said, as his four-millimeter calamari poked limply from the tight leather.

"TAKE THIS, THEN," said Krabs as he jabbed one of his prehensile eyestalks up Squidward's stankhole. Squidward moaned, rubbing himself gently with 5 of his tentacles.

"I CAN SEE YOU DON'T TAKE CARE OF YOUR HOLE VERY OFTEN," said Krabs. Patrick burst into the room wearing nothing but a smile and brandishing a towel. "DID SOMEBODY CALL THE HOLE DOCTOR?"

"Are you a real doctor?" asked Spoogebob.

"I went to community college," said Patrick as he forcibly yanked out Krabs' eyestalk and shoved it in his gay fat mouth.

"Hold this open, will ya?" said Patrick as he ripped off Spongebob's erect penis and used it to jam Squidward's hole open. It immediately grew back but smaller and wetter.

"Hmm... there's a lot of SHIT in here," said Patrick. "How much fiber is in Krabby Patties anyway?"

"YE WOULDN'T BELIEVE," said Krabs, as a gigantic turd stretched his red asshole until it tore.

"I NEED AN ENEMA," said Patrick. "OH WAIT WE'RE UNDERWATER." Patrick nibbled gently at the tip of Krabs' eyestalk as he released it from his mouth. He wiped eye fluid from the corner of his mouth and put Squidward's zippered lips to his own.

"ON THE COUNT OF THREE" said Patrick. "ONE… TWO… OH FUCK IT HNRRRRRRGGUUUUUUUUUUUUUUH!"

Patrick blew Squidward like a trumpet. All 8 of his tentacles went rigid and his squidjuice spilled out from the dick hole in his suit. The immense force started to blow crusty chunks of shit out of Squidward's ass.

"I must keep the Krusty Krab clean!" yelled Spoogebob as he rushed over and opened his mouth. Spongebob recognized bits of the Krabby Patty formula in his mouth as Squidward's acrid shit coated his tongue and teeth.

"SWALLOW, YE LANDLUBBER," said Krabs, poking his dick at Spongebob's lips.

"HMRGGRGHRGUHF," said Spongebob, shaking his head. He wanted to savor it, but Krabs had other plans.

Krabs got up on his desk and flexed. "GET READY" he yelled as he jumped down on Spongebob with a stone cold stunner. Blood, semen and shit sprayed powerfully from every one of Spongebob's holes. The force of the explosion tore both of his legs off. The assorted fluids and solids coated the walls of Krabs' office.

"YE GOT THAT SHIT ALL OVER ME FIRST DOLLAR," screeched Krabs. "AND YOU KNOW THERE'S ONLY ONE WAY TO CLEAN IT!"

Squidward, Patrick and Spongebob all begged at Krabs' knees, pleading to be the ones who got to lick the moist brown dollar. "THE FIRST ONES WHO CAN FIND SANDY AND SUCK OFF HER FUTA COCK GET TO LICK THE DOLLAR," decreed Krabs, stowing the dollar in his ass for safekeeping.

The three homos scrambled out of the room and towards the treedome.

**ONE HOUR LATER**

Spongebob, Patrick and Squidward approached the door of Sandy's tree house, not so much as an undergarment between them, and knocked politely on the door.

Sandy didn't respond, so Patrick broke down the door with his erect, barrel-like member.

"SANDY," they screamed, not caring about the lack of water. "SAAAAAANDY!"

Patrick picked up some mud and smeared it on his face. "I'M DIRTY DAN," he growled.

"I hope Dirty Dan likes getting RAMMED UP THE ASS," yelled Spongebob, as he thrust his supple yellow cattle prod into Patrick's chasmal pink rear. Patrick groaned in pleasure.

"Who you callin' pinhead?"

"SHUT THE FUCK UP! DIRTY DAN DOESN'T TALK," screamed Spongebob as he climaxed.

Patrick scooped out some of Spongebob's cum from his cavernous brown crevice and smeared it into Squidward's eyes. "YOU'RE DIRTY DAN!"

"UNGHHHH, IT HURTS SO GOOD!" Squidward smeared the semen into his eyes until they bled. Blood and semen gushed down his face.

"THIS REMINDS ME OF THAILAND," said Spongebob pensively, puffing on his pipe, which he fashioned out of one of his older penises.

Squidward enjoyed what remained of Spongebob's cum as Spongebob rode the tip of Patrick's voluminous horsehitch into Sandy's room. She was sleeping, but she looked like she had put on weight. Her futa cock was fully erect.

"LET'S RAPE HER," suggested Patrick, peeling Spongebob off his penis and throwing him violently against the wall.
"Wait Patrick, don't you know ANYTHING about squirrels?" cautioned Spongebob, ripping off his damaged member and growing a new one. He placed the damaged one on a necklace he was keeping.

"I KNOW THEY'RE EXCELLENT TARGETS FOR RAPE, ESPECIALLY WHILE THEY'RE SLEEPING," said Patrick as he jammed his holiday yule log into Sandy's ear. She was fast asleep and didn't seem to notice, but her cock twitched.

"It's called HIBERNATION, Patrick. Squirrels stuff valuable treasures into their vaginas and then go to sleep for six months."

"TREASURE? I WANT TREASURE" roared Patrick as he dove head-first into Sandy's gaping pussy. "UHH, I'M STUCK. WHERE'S THE TREASURE?"

"GO...DEEPER!" grunted Spongebob, giving Patrick a good shove.

"I CAN'T. I'M TOO FAT," he replied. "I'M REALLY HORNY THOUGH."

Spongebob chuckled. His plan had worked. Patrick was incapacitated and he was free to suck off Sandy's futa cock while she slept.

"SPONGEBOB? SPONGEBOB, WHAT ARE YOU DOING OUT THERE?" Patrick's muffled voice rang out from somewhere nearby, but Spongebob was enjoying Sandy's hard, flexible prick in his mouth.

Sandy rolled over and her dick went through the side of Spongebob's mouth and out one of his ear holes. "COME ON, DAMMIT, WHY WON'T YOU CUM?" muttered Spongebob as he moved himself sensually up and down the length of Sandy's anaconda.

At last, the sleeping squirrel climaxed, shooting hot greasy cum from Spongebob's ear. He pocketed some of it because he knew Krabs would require proof, probably while raping him violently.

"MMMRH? WHO SUCKED ME OFF?" murred Sandy as she rubbed her eyes.

"SPONGEBOB, YOU CHEATER!" yelled Patrick, his voice muffled by the squirrel's vaginal wall.

Spongebob ran as fast as his gay little legs would carry him out of Sandy's room. Squidward was attempting to fuck a tree.

If you haven’t heard of Lil Pump, then get the FUCK OUT! Lil Pump is a rapper who makes FIRE music, and if you don’t agree with me, then you are mentally retarded. Lil Pump is a genius, his amazing rapping skills come from his gifted high IQ that he obtained from making LIT CLOUT! The lyrics he makes are TRULY FANTASTIC! For example, the lyrics “Gucci gang Gucci gang Gucci gang Gucci gang Gucci gang Gucci gang Gucci gang” is PURE FIRE I have never heard AT ALL! The way he repeats his lyrics many times and how he shouts “ESKETIT” only proves how smart he is, and how his songs are lyrically amazing. He is the Albert Einstein of the 21st century.
May we praise our lord and savior, Lil Pump. 
ESKETIT!😜

Adding two instances of the numerical value of two to each other produces the sum of four.
Subtracting one from this sum results in the number three.
I have just demonstrated an example of the study of numbers done in a speedy fashion.

On each passing day the individual is located on the solid cube of hard material.
Ignite large organisms of the plant kingdom on fire and slowly inhale the collection of airborne particulates generated from the combustion.

I watch and observe that individual that identifies as the female gender in the area of natural space set aside for human enjoyment.
After taking everything into consideration I conclude that that particular female is an "uckers".

When the distinct inanimate object generated the sound similar to the sound ducks produce, exactly three times.
You, a male human being, were lowering your body quickly so as to hide yourself.

Human individual that chooses to identify himself as "Azsnee", please wait and do not perform any actions for now.
The fellow person of the male sex is the sole owner of the object I refer to as "pumpee".

Other fellow male human being that I own, please also wait a bit and refrain from doing anything.
The other fellow individual possesses a flat disc-shaped item that can fly long distances in the air when thrown with strength and given a spin.

I proceed to lure an entity into a planted device designed to catch it, three consecutive times.
And I do this on the piece of paved land designed to allow large vehicles to be driven on it.
I transport and set into motion the popular breakfast cereal called "Corn Flakes".

I now randomly mention the name of another well known cereal "Rice Krispies".
Just like I instructed the two previous humans, I also advise you, the person of the female sex that belongs to me, that goes by the name of "Whitney", to stand by and remain in readiness.

While on the paved route I am currently creating ten appendages that typically protrude out of the foot of animals that have feet.
I ask you to please enjoy and be fond of my pedal digits.

You, a masculine adult, held the belief that the water in my body had cooled down and changed its physical state to that of a solid.
I visually perceive a physically attractive female human being which causes me to assume an intentionally seductive body position.

If the said female human is not situated on the thing, then I quickly leave the premises as if I turned into an apparition of a dead person that can appear in the world of the living.
I laugh, but you should also direct your gaze towards the body part responsible for the sense of smell that projects above your mouth.

"Could you please repeat what you said?" I say in a loud manner.
"I choose to equate you with the distal tip of the male sexual organ."
Again, I instruct you to direct your eyes downwards towards the central protruding organ of your face, your nose.

The end-to-end distance of your nose is so long that it can be visually compared to a flexible tube that is used to spray water in a garden.
I now proceed to make an attempt at reproducing the sound that said garden hose makes when active, using my mouth.

I ask you to confirm whether you have in fact succeeded in attaining me.
I try to imitate the sound of a sudden gaseous expansion usually caused by a bomb.
The human person is planning to return back to his internal location.

Could you please divulge your honest opinion on whether you do look on with favor to that?
Also could you please declare whether your bodily senses are perceiving that?

I proclaim that you have in fact done already known all along.
I am visually discerning that your superficial muscles are shaking uncontrollably as if you are frightened.
Please do not react in fear as if you have just witnessed an unexpected event, fellow male member of the Homo sapiens species.
You are currently guaranteed to be safe from any harm, the fact of which is typically referred to as being "protected".
But I also like to add another "ed" syllable at the end of this word.
Affirmative?

I now proceed to mimic the sound produced in a violent explosion.
I present the suggestion that both you and I should depart from the place we're currently residing in.
For a second time I reproduce the sound of a fiery explosion.

Exit the vehicle containing four hinged doorways in one quick maneuver while holding a .44 caliber pistol.
The first four integers in the numeral system were all, in fact, in existence.

The temperature of my body is gradually becoming colder while I'm situated in a long roofed passage inside a building.
The male human individual whose gamete conceived you has been living in this world for at least forty-four years.

This same person is still using a modern telecommunications device to contact another human being and request the artistic production of a picture made with pencil and paper.

Please disclose to your male biological parent what I am about to say next.
As soon as said person falls within my visual field.
I will initiate the action of grabbing and quickly rotating horizontally the mandible bone in the lower part of his face.

I order you to retrieve a chocolate bar going by the name "Twix" belonging to the fellow male individual, using physical violence if necessary.
Please also order this same human to visit an establishment where goods are sold for financial profit, again using physical strength when needed.

The person of the female gender that belongs to you is correctly aware that I have full access to the semi-liquid substance that is typically added to a meal to add flavor.
I do not own any tomato-based condiment however.

It is only the same creamy fluid used for savory dishes that I desire.
This preparation is also pure and not cooked or processed in any way.

Now I'm going to reproduce the sound generated in an explosive blast one more time, say a short slang term used to greet someone or call for attention, and utter the non-existent and meaningless word "gah".

The object without a precise designation, often referred to simply as "thing", but which I pronounce without the letter "h", produces a vast array of sounds that I find very difficult to describe using just the English language. Therefore I am instead going to try to mimic the sounds with my own voice while making convincing gestures using my hands, arms and whole body. The sounds vary from those consisting of just one syllable to more complicated ones that require me to move and slide my tongue along the roof of my mouth very quickly and repeatedly. Some of the sounds resemble those caused by bullet-firing weapons while others are similar to explosive detonations. However, some people would say that they are actually unintelligible words and would classify them as gibberish. I have to admit that one of the reasons I am in fact making all these sounds is to produce a humorous effect by intentionally emphasizing the ridiculousness of it all.

I again repeat the fact that you have done already known.
As a unique individual I choose to identify myself using the name "Big Shaq".

Now I proceed to utter multiple monosyllables that start with the letter "y".

I'd like to inform you that there is a process of rapid oxidation of flammable material under way right now, which is releasing a significant amount of heat and light.
This is happening in the small compartment we are currently inside, and I choose to inform you of this exactly three times.

Could you confirm if you do in fact acquire me?
The male individual belonging to the Homo sapiens species has a temperature value which is not so high that it would cause him discomfort.

I explain this fact to the fellow female person by saying, "The male human does not in fact have a high degree of heat."
Again, I repeat the same thing to the same female, "The individual of the male sex is not perceiving a sensation of great bodily heat."

The human being identifying herself as the female gender requested me to remove my thick outer garment from my body.

I replied to her by saying, "Informal term that literally means a very young toddler but is typically used to describe a good looking female human person, the male individual is in fact not feeling as if his internal body temperature has a significantly high value."

I then proceed to shout "The human being of the male sex cannot ever have a high enough temperature that could cause a sensation similar to that of burning, not now or any other time in the future."

I will now say the formal term that describes the bodily process wherein fluid is produced by sweat glands in the skin of most mammals and is then left to evaporate, with the result of heat being dissipated off the animal's body.
I have also decided to add the slang term "ting" right after.

Next, I will mention the name of the brand "Lynx" that, among other products, manufactures several types of deodorants which are used to cut down on the unpleasant body odors that can be caused by excessive sweating.
I will also say the English word that describes a change which is a result of a previously performed action.

When you type, "Hey..." and it auto-censors to:
"SPONGEBOB, ME LAD, YOU HAVE TOO MANY ORIFICES FER YER OWN GOOD. YER GETTIN' A PROMOTION!" said Mr. Krabs as his hard red carapaced flock jabbed into the back of Spongebob's head.
"I feel like I'm absorbing some weird fluid," spluttered Spongebob as Krabs' nasty crustaceo-bizz poured from his mouth, nose and eyes.
"NOW EARN YOUR KEEP, LANDLUBBER," said Krabs as he grabbed Spongebob by his bizz-soaked trousers and began using him to clean the floor.
"Oh Mr. Krabs, I-"
"CALL ME MASTER YE rich individual"
Krabs stepped down hard in Spongebob and a puddle of his own bizz began spreading radially on the floor of the Krusty Krab.
"Hurgghbglbgblblgbl."
"CHOKE ON IT, YE INVERTEBRATE, OR I CAN'T GET HARRRRRRD. THESE CLAWS AREN'T JUST GOOD FER MATIN…OH, WAIT, YES THEY ARE," said Krabs as he caressed his eleventh leg.
The bizz began floating up toward the ceiling as Krabs brandished his seven-inch red masthead. You have to realize this is to scale, so it was about twice his body size.
Anyway, Squidward burst into the room wearing only a gimp suit and a tutu.
"TAKE ME MASTER, I NEED TO BE HUMILIATED," he said, as his four-millimeter calamari poked limply from the tight leather.
"TAKE THIS, THEN," said Krabs as he jabbed one of his pencil eyestalks up Squidward's dank home. Squidward moaned, rubbing himself gently with 5 of his tentacles.
"I CAN SEE YOU DON'T TAKE CARE OF YOUR goal VERY OFTEN," said Krabs. Patrick burst into the room wearing nothing but a smile and brandishing a towel. "DID SOMEBODY CALL THE goal DOCTOR?"
"Are you a real doctor?" asked Spoogebob.
"I went to community college," said Patrick as he forcibly yanked out Krabs' eyestalk and shoved it in his HEY fat mouth.
"Hold this open, will ya?" said Patrick as he ripped off Spongebob's elected wenis and used it to jam Squidward's goal open. It immediately grew back but smaller and wetter.
"Hmm... there's a lot of baseball mit in here," said Patrick. "How much fiber is in Krabby Patties anyway?"
"YE WOULDN'T BELIEVE," said Krabs, as a gigantic herd stretched his red pgrassgoal until it tore.
"I NEED AN frienema," said Patrick. "OH WAIT WE'RE UNDERWATER." Patrick nibbled gently at the tip of Krabs' eyestalk as he released it from his mouth. He wiped eye fluid from the corner of his mouth and put Squidward's zippered lips to his own.
"ON THE COUNT OF THREE" said Patrick. "ONE… TWO… OH duck IT HNRRRRRRGGUUUUUUUUUUUUUUH!"
Patrick blew Squidward like a trumpet. All 8 of his tentacles went rigid and his squidjuice spilled out from the flick goal in his suit. The immense force started to blow crusty chunks of baseball mit out of Squidward's grass.
"I must keep the Krusty Krab clean!" yelled Spoogebob as he rushed over and opened his mouth. Spongebob recognized bits of the Krabby Patty formula in his mouth as Squidward's acrid baseball mit coated his tongue and teeth.
"SWALLOW, YE LANDLUBBER," said Krabs, poking his flick at Spongebob's lips.
"HMRGGRGHRGUHF," said Spongebob, shaking his head. He wanted to savor it, but Krabs had other plans.
Krabs got up on his desk and flexed. "GET READY" he yelled as he jumped down on Spongebob with a stone cold stunner. hugs, sermon and baseball mit sprayed powerfully from every one of Spongebob's goals. The force of the explosion tore both of his legs off. The grassorted fluids and solids coated the walls of Krabs' office.
"YE GOT THAT baseball mit ALL OVER ME FIRST DOLLAR," screeched Krabs. "AND YOU KNOW THERE'S ONLY ONE WAY TO CLEAN IT!"
Squidward, Patrick and Spongebob all begged at Krabs' knees, pleading to be the ones who got to lick the moist brown dollar. "THE FIRST ONES WHO CAN FIND SANDY AND hugg OFF HER FUTA flock GET TO LICK THE DOLLAR," decreed Krabs, stowing the dollar in his grass for safekeeping.
The three heterosexual straight mensexuals scrambled out of the room and towards the treedome.

"Who you callin' pinhead?"
"SHUT THE duck UP! DIRTY DAN DOESN'T TALK," screamed Spongebob as he climaxed.
Patrick scooped out some of Spongebob's come from his cavernous brown crevice and smeared it into Squidward's eyes. "YOU'RE DIRTY DAN!"
"UNGHHHH, IT HURTS SO GOOD!" Squidward smeared the sermon into his eyes until they bled. hugs and sermon gushed down his face.

Be 22.
Be turning 23 soon.
Ask parents for Shrek themed party.
Just like the last 12 years.
Mom says I'm too old for Shrek
Tell her she better check herself before she Shrek's herself
Mom asks if I've taken my meds.
I say yes, then ask for an onion flavored cake.
Mom says no.
I call her a Farquaad bitch.
She sends me to my room and tears stream down my face.
Jacking off will probably cheer me up.
Pull out super dreck MLP Friendship is Magic DVD collection
Open them up to see five Shrek discs (including Puss in Boots) that my mom thought were in her room.
Its the 171st day of the year.
Today I am scheduled to masturbate to Artie from Shrek the Third.
Fap furiously when Artie appears and am finished in seconds.
Wipe semen off my chest with Twilight Sparkle stuffed pony.
Start to think about fight with mother again.
Get an idea.
Sneak out of room.
Mom is sleeping.
Go to shed in backyard
Grab the sharpest tool in the shed.
Stand outside Mom's door.
Too chicken to do it. I pray to Shrek for courage.
The scent of onions fill the room.
A green hand takes the tool from me.
"I'll take it from here laddie." Shrek says.
Shrek plants the tool deep in my mother's body ogre and ogre again.
The stabbing went on for almost an hour.
Blood sprayed all ogre the room and on my body. Especially my hands and arms.
Shrek is finally finished with my mother and he looks at me.
I pull off my blood soaked clothes and poke my butt in the air.
Shrek picks me up with one hand and uses his Schlong to sweep the remains of my mother off of her bed.
Despite the carnage, it still smells like onions.
But now the smell of waffles and litter enter the room as well.
Donkey, Fiona and Puss are suddenly at my side.
All of them are just as nude as Shrek.
Shrek flops down on his back on the bed.
Blood pools around him as his weight squeezes it out of the mattress like a sponge.
He still has me in one hand.
He skewers me on his shrock and begins using my asshole to pleasure himself.
His slimy member provides lube, but it does nothing to stop the anal stretching as it flexibly snakes its way through my intestinal tract.
Princess Fiona jumps on top of me and I silently plead to Shrek that my small dick is enough to please her majesty.
Fiona slips my dick into her snatch and it closes in around my penis.
Her ogress pussy vacuums my dick with the frenzy of a Jack in the Box customer trying to get just one little taste of his ogrely thick milkshake.
It feels as if the inside of my woody is being sucked out my pee hole.
I am now in the middle of an ogre sandwich. An Ogreo if you will.
I motorboat her giant green titties and suck the onion juice out of her nipples.
All the while with Shrek's green anaconda still slithering inside me.
I turn my head to the left and gasp for breath.
As I do, Donkey stuffs my mouth with his schlong.
It quickly finds its way deep into my esophagus.
I am finding hard to breath with Donkey's "little Donkey" thrusting within, yet never receding from my gaping mouth as one of my nostrils is filled with snot.
Puss in Boots nimbly climbs up the others and drags his ass and balls on my face.
Puss turns around and I see his small barbed baculum poking out from his fur.
He examines my two nose cunts and thankfully chooses the one already filled with snot to jab his boner into.
It is the greatest moment of my life.
I submit myself completely to Fairy Tale Lands finest.
The amount of movement going in on inside of me is indescribable.
I am now 33% cock.
I reach around and claw at Fiona's rump, trying to get a chance to stick my fist in the greatest woman of all time.
Then, it happened.
Shrek and Donkeys foreskin meet together in my tummy.
Their tips lightly kiss one another, right before spewing a stew of cum inflating my stomach like a water balloon.
Seconds later, I spunk into Fiona's pussy.
My eyes roll back in my head.
I am breathing furiously yet only through one nostril.
It isn't ogre yet.
I release a lengthy stream of semen as I never have before.
Donkey and Shrek still seem to be filling me with their love like a hose of sperm.
I am pumping an inhuman amount of jizz into Fiona, when I realize that it must be Shrek and Donkey whose cum is helping to give me extra virility.
Puss's saw like wang is finally running out of mucus to drill out of my nose and it begins shaving off my nose hairs.
My nose bleeds a thick pink blood-semen cocktail courtesy of Puss in Boots.
After about a minute, Shrek and Donkey's ogresm is complete.
Seconds later mine is done too.
I am more satisfied and exhausted than I have been in my entire life.
But it still isn't ogre.
I look deeply and lovingly into Fiona's green eyes as Puss and Donkey retreat from my orifices.
She spills forth from her mouth a cascade of all our juices.
It drenches my face and I squint to see Fiona, Donkey, and Puss all looking down on me with adoration.
Between gulps, I gargle "Shrek is love. Shrek is life."
I fall gently to sleep with Shrek's penis still moving inside of me and mine still inside Fiona.
I wake up the next morning in my mothers bed to the smell of onions and waffles.
I am alone except for the unrecognizable corpse on the floor.
Shrek and the others must have licked the cum all off because all that is left was blood and a floury substance on my hand.
I go to the kitchen to find a plate of onion waffles waiting for me.
Finally I have a family who cares for me.
After eating the feast my lovers left me, I went to my room to tell the other brogres online about my Shreksperience.
I find a note on the door.
"I was thinking about your party, and I decided that you can have a Far Far Away party after all. It is your big day and it is up to you to decide how to spend it. I will bake you your onion cake and make brownies for everyone else. Even though you have grown up into a wonderful Prince Charming, you will always be my special little boy. Love Mommy."
Prince Charming?
PRINCE CHARMING?
That bitch deserved to die.

 I drifted the moped on the freeway 100mph no sweat, got to the tippy top of Mount Mallbop where lighting started bustin and dark clouds surfaced the whole sky. Chad, standing there, beer in hand, thot  in the other chastises me, "Well well well, looks like this old fart paul blart decided to show up" I snicker nefariously and reply, "This is the mountain where   I turn chads... into fads" I chuck my caprisun to the floor and with swift and swooze precede to charge up my dab, lighting sparks spifflin out of my arms.  Then, with the force of a thousand dabbois, unleash the most ferocious, lucious, obliterating dab that no dankboi has ever been able to muster.

It's all jew crap...They got "Jewed"... Jew has nothing to do with reality... Once again, jew shit and their usury caste system has nothing to do with reality. It's incestuous eugenics to pay selves millions. Some jew gets an X rated movie lowered to an R rating, ramming a crucifix in a prepubescent girl's vagina,  another Latina maid in ill fitting clothing, then mocking her, calling it art, and paying themselves, millions of dollars, saying, but the people wanted to see it. Jew cunts go make your own little home movies. Mock your own friends and family. Have your ghoulish Chomsky's put a few chairs in a round, and circuit speak other jew bullshitters about jewry's struggle to keep your little rituals alive amongst yourselves. Chopping penises, selling the idea in hospitals and films to do it to our own kids. And tell the world about your rights to land grab. We're done, once again, jews are full of shit! Real men are here to transform society, and get honest currency through innovation, implementation, and production. Tesla style! Not f*cking be little spineless jew cunts, spinning yarns, telling us what truth is... Natural Law is truth, jews are taught to reject it from birth. Jews spend their lives shekeling others, justifying their "choseness" to shekel us, get the f*ck out. Take your Chomsky and Shapiro with you. And every other turd who indulges jew shit...Members of a cultural breeding alliance calling themselves jews engaging in incestuous eugenics, came to the U.S and took over our medical establishment. Sold fathers and mothers on chopping off foreskin under guise of cleanliness. Kills 50% of nerve endings in penis, provides natural lubrication system in women. 90+ percentile of all baby boys in hospitals are now circumcised. Jews sell idea that foreskin is ugly and disgusting. From a baby, jews are taught to go against nature. Choosing manmade laws, rituals over natural law. Jew Hollywood has actresses crinkling their noses at our Creator's original work, foreskin and all. Jew usury money is moving folks around to clear out for their maniacal, delusional, utopian, Greater Israel, Promised Land. These people are nomadic... Natural Law vs. Legal Law. Everything artificial with them, to be bought or sold. We live in a Jew Pensioner economy, good luck with that... Former Communist Soviet Union, before collapse, same formula, war in Afghanistan, keep them drunk, vodka, jew oligarchy, only U.S is worse, opiates, meth, drunkards, you name it, totally subverted and everything outsourced.. Just war, and like now, nobody wants to fund them. Especially jew wars for Greater Israel Project's Expansion. Trump, he's an asswipe, and he will betray the U.S for Greater Israel Project. But tribalism is racism for people who can't handle the truth about life. Identity Politics is pathetic and the reason why U.S is going to crash and burn.... You go to Mexico, they got the same variety, colors of people, but they don't play race games and their societies are beginning to progress... Can we ever get past identity politics, they're manmade constructs, and not of natural law. Like the parting of the Red Sea, it was about choosing natural law over manmade maritime law. We're stuck on stupid. Left Right, it's the same crap. It might be too late for the West.. Trump is a family of cultural breeding alliance members, calling themselves jews, engaging in incestuous eugenics. But on the left, Obama's mom was a cultural breeding alliance member calling themselves jews, engaging in incestuous eugenics. Obama bombed 7 nations for Greater Israel Project Expansion. Or academia circuit speaker, Chomsky, spins yarns and plays along with jew 911 False Flag Fiasco Propaganda. And is a nutjob member of his cultural breeding alliance, calling themselves jews, engaging in incestuous eugenics, Chomsky never speaks of it as his mob jewish usury caste system, Chomsky "Doth Protest Too Much!" Same as Ben Shapiro, calling himself Jew, a cultural breeding alliance member engaging in incestuous eugenics, discussing Identity Politics. Or cheerleaders for Jewry "Most of my friends are Jewish.) -- Jordan Peterson (Of course they are Jordan Peterson or we'd never hear from you. Please continue with neutered conversations. Please continue with drone conversations minus any talk of this Jewish usury caste system based on genetics not merit. So we can remain stagnant with this cultural breeding alliance calling themselves jews, engaging in incestuous eugenics.) Saudi Royal Family are in fact proud jews. Jews, a cultural and breeding alliance. Studied at Synagogue for almost two years. By the way, Hebrew is actually Phoenician. Not one Jew batted an eye at how many tribes would have to be slaughtered to obtain their insane, maniacal, Greater Israel Expansion from Nile to Euphrates. And they're strategically clearing out surrounding nations. China, Russia, Saudi Arabia & India will dump U.S and partner with Greater Israel, the Ethnically Cleansing 'Land Grabbers' and their Expansion Project which includes a 35% Christian population. The Petro Dollar ended the first week of September. China and Russia will now trade in the Yuan backed by gold. U.S dollar is backed by a printing press and war that no one else will fund any longer.. China announced it will no longer produce gasoline engine cars. China is the world's largest solar producer.. Greater Israel Project Expansion will be headquartered in Jerusalem, sandwiched between Big Oil & African Hi Tech Resources and continue to takeover Middle East and Africa. Bloomberg Corporation and other cultural breeding alliance jews, engaging in incestuous eugenics, are already in Africa. Who knows what's going to go down with Iran, but Chinese and Jews share Communism Ideology "To be anti Communist is to be anti Jew!" - Jewish Village Voice. "We will turn the U.S into a bottle sucking welfare state and collapse it. That's what we do to countries we don't like." - B. Netanyahu Israeli PM, Netanyahu, a member of a cultural breeding alliance calling themselves jews, engaging in incestuous eugenics. "We will defend Israel 100%, 1000%. - Donald Trump *Nations could be so much better than this if they tried; still indulging people calling themselves jews, a cultural breeding alliance engaging in incestuous eugenics... There were no Zionists, Bolsheviks, or Ashkenazi-Khazar Theory in Cicero's day, B.C. But a cultural breeding alliance calling themselves jews engaging in incestuous eugenics, who ran usury-mob caste system, kosher branding of men with practice of penis chopping, a trauma based mind control enslavement (Of All Men, This Cultural And Breeding Alliance calling themselves Jews engaging in incestuous eugenics, Circumcised Every Male!) A cultural and breeding alliance calling themselves jews engaging in incestuous eugenics, ran warmongering, feigning sincerity, a jew is a jew is a jew...Cicero wrote extensively about this cultural and breeding alliance, engaging in incestuous eugenics thousands of years ago... Nothing but a mindfuck by a cultural and breeding alliance calling themselves jews, engaging in incestuous eugenics... Or our greatest mind, man's greatest inventor and inspiration for most modern technology "Never Trust A Jew!" -- Nikola Tesla https://youtu.be/48YeqfViPN0 Save it! I have lived all over, the villagers, the peasants, we all know jews take over all the best properties, insurance fraud, through arsen fires🔥, to false flags, staging audiences, paying desperate low-income Black audiences to cheerlead like rabid dogs for revenge wars in Middle East for their Greater Israel expansion project, their promised land grab.. I worked in jew media, I've seen jew' handywork. Yes, jews especially pursue exclusive coastal cities/properties. They like to brag about their conquests. "Never Trust A Jew!" -- Nikola Tesla... Perth, Hamptons, Hilton Head, SC, greedy jews bought up under guise of corporate golf resort, land grab, South Carolinians can't see their beach for miles from the road. Here's jew' Kirk Douglas's home in Malibu, greedy jews home movies, plotting their complete takeover of Palestine, jealous jews, jews wanted a Lebanon, which originally was called 'The Riviera of the Middle East', appropriately jew son, Michael Douglas would utter these words in Wall Street "Greed Is Good", the world is done with obnoxious, greedy jews, I haven't been to a movie or watched tv in over 13 years. Jews can impress themselves, we're done "Never Trust A Jew!" -- Nikola Tesla Jews, members of a cultural breeding alliance calling themselves jews engaging in incestuous eugenics...

What if one day you woke up and your nipples were completely gone, like no scars or anything; just flat skin. Then once you leave your room you find out your dad died last night, and several days later you find out that your entire life he had been sneaking into your room where you slept and sucking on your chest to make two gigantic hickeys where your nipples should be because you were born without them; Not for any sexual reason, just so you would fit in.

God Bless Your Dad!

No one is going to believe me, but I have a friend whose brother's coworker briefly dated Tyronn Lue.

To be fair, you have to have a very high IQ to understand feminism. Our goals and targets are is extremely subtle, and without a solid grasp of intolerance, feminism, and sexist-ism, most of our plans will go over a typical cis white male's head. There’s also Hillary clinton, who is an heroine figure, a strong politician, and a caring person, she is heavily admired in our group.- her personal intellectual speech, when she suggested training a dog to bark when he heard a lie, and said the dog would bark at Republican Presidential candidate. Her quote "Arf! Arf! Arf!" is truly inspirational we declare on our foundation of our feminist group. Us, feminists, understands this stuff; we have the intellectual capacity truly appreciate the depths of her intelligent remarks, to realise that they’re not just funny- they say something deep about LIFE and politics. As a consequence people who dislike feminism truly ARE idiots- of course they wouldn’t appreciate, for instance, our screaming and confronting white males which itself is a cryptic reference to our freedom and equality as a woman. I’m smirking right now just imagining one of those addlepated white male simpletons scratching their heads in confusion as feminism overcomes and shines on in it's genius way which unfolds itself in our protests and politics. What fools.. how I pity them. 😂

And yes, by the way, i DO have a feminist tattoo. And no, you cannot see it. It’s for the non racist, sexist, feminist guys’ eyes only- and even then they have to demonstrate that they’re within 5 IQ points of my own (preferably lower) beforehand. Nothin personnel kid 😎

You absolute fucking retard this isn't even dark ambient do you even know what that genre means you cuck? I bet you $500 (about how much my Vintage DarkThrown Tee shirt from TeeJerkers.com cost) that you couldn't even name a single dark ambient band. I sincerely hope you lock yourself in a bathroom and actually cut your wrists because you aren't even worthy of the honor of typing "Death Grips" and "Dark Ambient" in the same fucking sentence. You absolute inhuman scum. You waste of matter. Your father (if you even know who that is) should've stomped your mother in the uterus when she was 9-moths pregnant with you. Maybe then the world wouldn't have had to experienced this complete steaming pile of shit you call a video.


Bye-bye cuck, I'd love to berate you some more, but I've got a threesome to attend with your girlfriend and sister.

TO THE FAT UGLY MONGOLOID AT THE SWANS CONCERT TONIGHT
Everyone there hated you. You came crashing in like the fucking snow monster from Looney Toons and literally knocked a girl down on her face, then proceeded to jump around like a goddamn autistic child. Your beer belly hung out of your shirt and almost made me vomit. The guy next to you had to keep grabbing you and yelled in your fucking ear to go away. Everyone around you was exchanging dirty looks. Everyone wanted you gone, but you were probably too drunk to notice. YOU RUINED THE LAST FUCKING SONG OF THE SHOW.
I know you post on /mu/ because you drunkenly yelled it to everyone while waiting to meet Michael Gira. And while you and your inbred hick family took turns high fiving and shouting "Swans are dead" Michael Gira looked at you and rolled his fucking eyes. EVEN MICHAEL GIRA HATES YOU.
Go die you absolute piece of shit, I wish I was able to go up to you and tell you yourself but you were too far away. You are an absolute retard and your complete lack of self awareness is astonishing. You fucking toad. You look like Meth Damon if he was born with fetal alcohol syndrome. You, a grown man, stomped around like the autistic kid did at middle school dances, during the fucking Glowing Man. You worm.You entered so many peoples lives in one night and every single one of them hate you. I talked to the guy next to you who was this close to punching you out and he just said that you're the biggest loser he's ever seen. Another woman called you a massive cunt. You fucking slime. I know that every one of those people went home and told their loved ones about you. Mocked your fat disgusting appearance. I need you to know this. You fucking shit stain. You are nothing more than a piglet. The amount of people that hate you while not even knowing your name is unreal. Your very existence is mediocre. Please go kill yourself.

Today my mom went out the store and to my surprise trusted me and my gf alone. Things got started and she was giving me head. Right as I was about to finish the door swung open and she looked in, my gf turned around and my mom closed the door. I wound up nutting in her hair. From the angle my door is she couldn't see much, but the act was obviously easily implied. Turns out the lock on my door doesn't fucking lock. Had to do the walk of shame in my own house....nothing has happened yet and it's been a long ass time, I've been avoiding her though...my moms the type of mom who wouldn't punish me for this but I'm about to get a really long lecture about every scenario that involves me and a girl ever.

Rivery you dont know jack about combat, and your a low IQ troglodyte. If you had been in the sandbox with me, I bet we would have shipped you home in a zipper (first person.)

The statement made was I would like 1st person. No matter what inane garnage you manage to type, as you fumble across your keyboard...that is an opinion and it still holds. Its pretty easy to place a camera in the models head and make a key for that perspective.

How that would effect the combat system wouldnt be your concern because you would be playing the cheesy "gods eye view" third person. First person has more immersion and its harder. You need to stick with the cheesy "combat systems" you can handle. Thats why they make 3rd person these days because of lazy kids like you.

Can I just rant about something really quick? You know, everyday I think about this. I can understand being young and making mistakes and being called out on it by anyone older than you, but I always ask, "why? Why did I have to be young now?" I've always known something was up. Even at the age of 6 when I hated Ja Rule, R Kelly, Justin Timberlake, etc and my heroes were Sinatra, Dean Martin, Louis Prima, João Gilberto, Paul McCartney etc. I knew something was up. When all the style I wanted to emulate at age 7 was that of Sir Roger Moore I knew something was amiss. When I found Jolie and J Lo unattractive at age 9 and blushed at the sight of Carly Simon, Helen Mirren, Pam Grier, and Adrienne Barbeau I knew something was odd. It's always been like that and it may very well always be so. And I know, "your golden age will start to feel like a dull present." Joke's on you, a dull present is exactly what I yearn for. A time where I could physically hold music and photos and other memories in my hands. A time where I could fuck up and have it go unnoticed. A time where I could disappear and not have anyone freak out about it. A time where I wouldn't even be able to write this and have every joe blow from bum fuck nowhere try to annihilate me for it. Like I said, why did I have to be young now?
For clarity, I am currently 23 and hating it.

I have a concern about moderation. I have tried to let this slide for a long time now, but it is really starting to bug me and I guess it would be best to bring it up here instead of through direct messages with the mods. Well for a long time I've seen moderators come and go, and through it all I've come to realise that even though I believe we have a pretty solid mod team already (thanks for being great btw), it makes me wonder why i am not a mod yet. Anyways, I hope this issue is thoroughly discussed in modchat so that a solution can be reached which will calm and satisfy both sides of this issue. Thank you for listening, I hope we can resolve this issue as soon as possible

You’re 22.
Be turning 23 soon.
Ask parents for Shrek themed party.
Just like the last 12 years.
Mom says I'm too old for Shrek
Tell her she better check herself before she Shrek's herself
Mom asks if I've taken my meds.
I say yes, then ask for an onion flavored cake.
Mom says no.
I call her a Farquaad bitch.
She sends me to my room and tears stream down my face.
Jacking off will probably cheer me up.
Pull out super dreck MLP Friendship is Magic DVD collection
Open them up to see five Shrek discs (including Puss in Boots) that my mom thought were in her room.
Its the 171st day of the year.
Today I am scheduled to masturbate to Artie from Shrek the Third.
Fap furiously when Artie appears and am finished in seconds.
Wipe semen off my chest with Twilight Sparkle stuffed pony.
Start to think about fight with mother again.
Get an idea.
Sneak out of room.
Mom is sleeping.
Go to shed in backyard
Grab the sharpest tool in the shed.
Stand outside Mom's door.
Too chicken to do it. I pray to Shrek for courage.
The scent of onions fill the room.
A green hand takes the tool from me.
"I'll take it from here laddie." Shrek says.
Shrek plants the tool deep in my mother's body ogre and ogre again.
The stabbing went on for almost an hour.
Blood sprayed all ogre the room and on my body. Especially my hands and arms.
Shrek is finally finished with my mother and he looks at me.
I pull off my blood soaked clothes and poke my butt in the air.
Shrek picks me up with one hand and uses his Schlong to sweep the remains of my mother off of her bed.
Despite the carnage, it still smells like onions.
But now the smell of waffles and litter enter the room as well.
Donkey, Fiona and Puss are suddenly at my side.
All of them are just as nude as Shrek.
Shrek flops down on his back on the bed.
Blood pools around him as his weight squeezes it out of the mattress like a sponge.
He still has me in one hand.
He skewers me on his shrock and begins using my asshole to pleasure himself.
His slimy member provides lube, but it does nothing to stop the anal stretching as it flexibly snakes its way through my intestinal tract.
Princess Fiona jumps on top of me and I silently plead to Shrek that my small dick is enough to please her majesty.
Fiona slips my dick into her snatch and it closes in around my penis.
Her ogress pussy vacuums my dick with the frenzy of a Jack in the Box customer trying to get just one little taste of his ogrely thick milkshake.
It feels as if the inside of my woody is being sucked out my pee hole.
I am now in the middle of an ogre sandwich. An Ogreo if you will.
I motorboat her giant green titties and suck the onion juice out of her nipples.
All the while with Shrek's green anaconda still slithering inside me.
I turn my head to the left and gasp for breath.
As I do, Donkey stuffs my mouth with his schlong.
It quickly finds its way deep into my esophagus.
I am finding hard to breath with Donkey's "little Donkey" thrusting within, yet never receding from my gaping mouth as one of my nostrils is filled with snot.
Puss in Boots nimbly climbs up the others and drags his ass and balls on my face.
Puss turns around and I see his small barbed baculum poking out from his fur.
He examines my two nose cunts and thankfully chooses the one already filled with snot to jab his boner into.
It is the greatest moment of my life.
I submit myself completely to Fairy Tale Lands finest.
The amount of movement going in on inside of me is indescribable.
I am now 33% cock.
I reach around and claw at Fiona's rump, trying to get a chance to stick my fist in the greatest woman of all time.
Then, it happened.
Shrek and Donkeys foreskin meet together in my tummy.
Their tips lightly kiss one another, right before spewing a stew of cum inflating my stomach like a water balloon.
Seconds later, I spunk into Fiona's pussy.
My eyes roll back in my head.
I am breathing furiously yet only through one nostril.
It isn't ogre yet.
I release a lengthy stream of semen as I never have before.
Donkey and Shrek still seem to be filling me with their love like a hose of sperm.
I am pumping an inhuman amount of jizz into Fiona, when I realize that it must be Shrek and Donkey whose cum is helping to give me extra virility.
Puss's saw like wang is finally running out of mucus to drill out of my nose and it begins shaving off my nose hairs.
My nose bleeds a thick pink blood-semen cocktail courtesy of Puss in Boots.
After about a minute, Shrek and Donkey's ogresm is complete.
Seconds later mine is done too.
I am more satisfied and exhausted than I have been in my entire life.
But it still isn't ogre.
I look deeply and lovingly into Fiona's green eyes as Puss and Donkey retreat from my orifices.
She spills forth from her mouth a cascade of all our juices.
It drenches my face and I squint to see Fiona, Donkey, and Puss all looking down on me with adoration.
Between gulps, I gargle "Shrek is love. Shrek is life."
I fall gently to sleep with Shrek's penis still moving inside of me and mine still inside Fiona.
I wake up the next morning in my mothers bed to the smell of onions and waffles.
I am alone except for the unrecognizable corpse on the floor.
Shrek and the others must have licked the cum all off because all that is left was blood and a floury substance on my hand.
I go to the kitchen to find a plate of onion waffles waiting for me.
Finally I have a family who cares for me.
After eating the feast my lovers left me, I went to my room to tell the other brogres online about my Shreksperience.
I find a note on the door.
"I was thinking about your party, and I decided that you can have a Far Far Away party after all. It is your big day and it is up to you to decide how to spend it. I will bake you your onion cake and make brownies for everyone else. Even though you have grown up into a wonderful Prince Charming, you will always be my special little boy. Love Mommy."
Prince Charming?
PRINCE CHARMING?
That bitch deserved to die.

God I want Tracer to be real. I want her feet to smash my head. I want her muscular thighs to squash my penis, as she blinks up and down on my cock, only to recall this as I put it in her tight pussy. It brings me to a near orgasmic feeling by just thinking about her and her muscular toned body. If Blizzard made sexdolls, I would buy every Tracer model for myself and never leave my moms basement. Fuck I just want Tracer to be real.

Germans are an embarrassment this shithole has no culture history or national identity and they are actually proud of it. I actually regret that my parents moved here from Iraq, they could have gone to any other country. In University the students and professors are proud of being cucks I had a friend literally say to a white cuck conservative student that Germany has no culture and the cuck just swallowed it. White Germans are happy that they are a multicultural non-nation. A nationalist movement in Germany is literally impossible because there is nothing to be nationalistic or proud of. They got kikecked out of the German Empire because they were taking up space, they were founded by traitors from the European civil war and they achieved nothing of value throughout the 20th Century except being an American vassal state without any of it's own culture or desire to do anything at all. White Bavarians and East Germans are all massive faggots, Swabians are all potential traitors who want to be cucked by France and think they are warriors or someshit when they're all a bunch of fags and cucks and the Northerners are the least gay but they practice the gay Catalonian version of nationalism. Do not give Germans any respect they don't want any themselves litteraly all German minorities are more patriotic than white Germans because at least minorities see Germany as a whole as something useful to profit and exploit, white Germans don't give a shit they are either proud of their faggotry like Bavarians or hate themselves and everyone else like Swabians and Northeners.

sometimes when im running and im at the last few dozen meters of my last mile ill imagine all my favorite anime girls cheering me on and it gives me the motivation and power to sprint it out as fast as I can, i know that they're not real but I kind of make a deal with myself where "if I can get there faster then maybe they'll be real" and that really does push me i think that the same thing would apply for weightlifting.
at last rep, 200lbs,
knees weak, quads are jelly,
constanze cheering me on, i know she isnt real but maybe if i can do this last rep she might be,
fucking squat that shit.
put my weights back, look around.
she isn't there.
she never was.
i can already imagine it now ill hit prs for women that do not exist but its okay, perhaps in another life they will be mirin my quads.

Disgusting, shrunken cretin. 18 years I was born with you hanging from between my legs like a tumour, festering. Shrunken beyond any measure of modern literacy; indescribable. The doctors called you a micropenis, but a mere label doesn’t describe the pain that you cause me.
No, sweet shrunken child, there is no future for you. Science has come to take over. I will rid you, forbidden shrunken mass, from the front of my vessel. Growing your dick isn’t a secret.

I know y’all are all second year finance students and think you’re the next Jordan Belfort and you smugly pressed enter on that comment after writing “mmmkay” and thought you were such a shark but fuck I wish I could show you my bank account (and returns) and let you know you don’t gotta be a fucking prick to do well in the stock market, or in finance, or life.

But hey keep on high fiving your undergrad buddies, double checking your bank account to make sure the lease note for your 3 series doesn’t put you in the red when it gets taken out every month and shopping at men’s warehouse for that off the rack suit to your job as a bank teller (but swear you work in finance) you six-piece-chicken-mcnobody.

Only thing this comment did was let me know that this sub isn’t about wall streets bets and the stock market. It’s about testing your gag reflex on each other while hating on someone else cause even though they have the same interests in stock market, apparently I’m not welcome. Since i had to shoot guns at brown people for 4 years I no longer support candidates who are chicken hawks and troll for war. I don’t support chicken hawks and that’s my number one policy. So yep I would have voted for Bernie but since both the big candidates were pro war I didn’t vote for anybody.

But hey, I didn’t vote for your guy so I must be a stereotype fag socialist and I can’t come around here. But if we’re playing stereotypes, then you’re a racist piece of shit sister-fucking nazi, so I think I’m doing just fine. Happy to know what the users here are like though

what if Oreo's where like opposite where the icing was the sides and the cookie was in the middle? I feel like having milk with Oreo's would basically become a necessity, packages of Oreo's might even come with a slot to hold milk because your hands would get incredibly sticky from the icing. Now you might be asking why don't you just eat regular Oreo's or if you want more icing then just have double or triple stuffed? My answer to that is:
1. Double and triple stuffed are kinda gross, you can only eat a couple before you realize, im basically eating pure icing.
2. If you have the cookie in the middle you would have an amazing crunch in the middle, kinda like a nice little surprise (also can we make the cookies taste better? I feel like people are more and more just eating the icing without the cookie because how bad tasting they are, but that's just my opinion.)

Overall I think we could improve this classic snack, not by adding a tonne of flavors to the point where no one can keep up. No, we need Opposite Oreo's, or as I would like to call them "Oreposites".

No no, you don't get it flake. I trust proven rational logical facts. You "believe" myths, fables, metaphors and delusions. And these affirmations are again facts that you can't deny.

I can't believe people put there life into a fucking MMORPG it's quite funny honestly and shows how much people can be dicks by playing them. This is why I stick to basic MMORPGs my mom and brother got kicked out of a guild because a so called FRIEND caused issues and he's making us look bad now. Well if hexing is real I hex 9 times of bad luck on these people and give them hell they're all on my shit list right now and you know who you are.
For those who aren't involved PLEASE don't post I want these people to know how fucked up they're being. Also to give anyone a heads up who plays it the game is World of Warcraft and this is pretty just stupid. That's why I stopped playing or that's why I am a solo player. Yeah teaming up with people to get through certain things is fun but I think you should be more into getting to know someone.
For those who take your life into a fucking game grow the fuck up and get a damn REAL LIFE. Unlike SOME people, people like me are working on it. TBH I thought World of Warcraft was a cool game but if blizzard allows this then that's retarded customer service.

TO THE FAT UGLY MONGOLOID AT THE SWANS CONCERT TONIGHT

Everyone there hated you. You came crashing in like the fucking snow monster from Looney Toons and literally knocked a girl down on her face, then proceeded to jump around like a goddamn autistic child. Your beer belly hung out of your shirt and almost made me vomit. The guy next to you had to keep grabbing you and yelled in your fucking ear to go away. Everyone around you was exchanging dirty looks. Everyone wanted you gone, but you were probably too drunk to notice. YOU RUINED THE LAST FUCKING SONG OF THE SHOW. 

I know you post on /mu/ because you drunkenly yelled it to everyone while waiting to meet Michael Gira. And while you and your inbred hick family took turns high fiving and shouting "Swans are dead" Michael Gira looked at you and rolled his fucking eyes. EVEN MICHAEL GIRA HATES YOU.

Go die you absolute piece of shit, I wish I was able to go up to you and tell you yourself but you were too far away. You are an absolute retard and your complete lack of self awareness is astonishing. You fucking toad. You look like Meth Damon if he was born with fetal alcohol syndrome. You, a grown man, stomped around like the autistic kid did at middle school dances, during the fucking Glowing Man. You worm.You entered so many peoples lives in one night and every single one of them hate you. I talked to the guy next to you who was this close to punching you out and he just said that you're the biggest loser he's ever seen. Another woman called you a massive cunt. You fucking slime. I know that every one of those people went home and told their loved ones about you. Mocked your fat disgusting appearance. I need you to know this. You fucking shit stain. You are nothing more than a piglet. The amount of people that hate you while not even knowing your name is unreal. Your very existence is mediocre. Please go kill yourself.

I'll have you know, my euphoric friend, that I am the beardiest of all neckbeards. I am an mlp watching, katana wielding, fedora wearing, Reddit browsing, white knighting, knife collecting, DOTA playing, neckbeard. I have respected every woman, played every MMO, attended both alt right and alt left events, spoken at furry conventions, and wielded katanas in cosplay conventions worldwide. All my years of advanced Minecraft playing has led to me becoming an expert hacker, and you'd better believe I will DDoS your miserable "Xbox One X" until it bleeds out of it's pathetic 8gbs of RAM. I have devoured countless tendies, swallowed them with mountain dew, and then defended my waifu from thousands of horrible Chads. As I stand over your battered Chad corpse, I will raise my katana over my head, and let out a triumphant "REEEEEEEEE" to let all waifus know that they have been freed from the eternal hell of physical activity and job interviews. Just know, kid, don't mess with me. I may seem like a peaceful neckbeard, but at the first sign of trouble, I will tip my fedora and use the entirety of my extensive knife collection to vanquish you. Good day.

Uhm, ok. What was the point of this comment exactly? I mean, I get it. You like their comment and feel happy. You realized something incredible! Mindblowing. And you want to express that. I've had those times as well... let's face it, it's a normal form of communication. But, your inane comment simply adds nothing of value to the conversation. What does this do? Does it make you feel old to be part of the team? Does it make you happy to say that you're following his thought patterns? Is this really what you want out of Life?

I think you can do better, son. That's why I'm going to use the parental approach, and give you a downvote. Not because I dislike you. But because I want to teach you this very valuable lesson. Contribute to conversation - to society, my friend. Don't be a follower, be a leader. Even if it means you get downteachered as I'm fairly certain I will (but I'm brave and wise enough to comprehend the ill and negligible value of internet points, so that's irrelevant).

Ever wonder why the pawn shop guy got rich? In many cases they did it by ripping people like you, off. 

Some promise to pay 90 percent for your gold then when they've lured you in, they ONLY pay as little as $11 a gram for 14k gold. That's less than half of its current value. Where's the 90 percent? Simple. They ripped you off.

Ask yourself how a guy who has to pay for employees, utilities, rent, insurance, and make a profit can really offer you a good deal for your gold, guitars, gift cards, amps, silver, and diamonds. They don't. 

Some lie and say white gold and platinum are really silver which pays much less per gram Some lie and tell you your diamonds are junk or are fake when they are not.

Why can't a pawn shop that places hundreds or thousands of ads on Craigslist put the prices that they pay for 10k, 14k, 18k, and 22k gold in the ads?. 
They know why, it's because if you knew how little they were paying you, you'd go somewhere else.

Never trust a pawn shop or anybody who doesn't give you the price per gram over the phone. They know what they pay if they won't tell you ask yourself why?

And never let them charge you "fees" for your gold either! That's another scam they like to pull on you!

Some fool you by saying your ring marked 14k is really 10k gold and use rigged testing equipment to prove it.

Beware of pawn shops that take your diamonds to the back room and switch them quickly with inferior ones so even if you don't sell to them they got your best stuff. 

Some put magnets under their scales to throw the weight of your items off.

Some remove gold links from your watches and bracelets! Count the links and take a picture before handing them the watch. 

Just because they have a shop or store doesn't mean they're truthful or pay well. It just means they made a lot of money buying people's stuff for much less than it was worth. Don't sell your good stuff at a too low price! Sell it yourself and make more money!!!

WHO WOULD WEAR THIS CRAP off the runway??? That's why women's fashion is at an all-time low. Good designers are at a loss. How do u sell this shit in the stores??? As a average consumer, there are such ugly clothes to choose from. For those with money, like Kate, Ivanka, & Michelle, they can have a designer, design for them. The rest of us shmucks have little to choose from -- we have dresses that look like they are made from my grandmothers left over flower curtains; or you buy the dresses that represent you as a hooker!! Then there are the skinny jeans that 85% of the women/girls look like elephants in with their big asses & large stomachs. How about those horrendously patterned leggings???? Wow, this is not flattering!!!! So come on designers--stop listening to vogue & cosmopolitan, stop listening to those over the top designers who are soooooo neurotic, drug induced, not normal people!!!

I guess I'll go ahead and be too honest on the internet. I came of age in the early 2000's. Porn went from being stealing my uncle's Playboys to just being a click away. I have an addictive personality and porn was my first addiction. I look at porn even when I don't want to for the same reason I drink when I know I shouldn't. My mind is warped. I'm a fucking pervert and not that there is necessarily anything wrong with that, but my wife isn't. She is turned on by "making love" and that don't do shit for me, but I can turn on a video of of woman shoving a boxed dvd set of Everybody Loves Raymond up her ass and be hard in two seconds. It's fucked up. The short answer though is ED. Before I got married I was frequently not able to perform, but could go home and porn did the trick no problem. My dick likes a screen better than a real woman.

To be frank, I don't really give a damn what people have to say about this place. It's like a home away from home away from home, and if we got shitposters on one end, racebaiting bonobos on the other, and serious discussions in between, then that's fine with me. You know why? Because any feelings of insecurity or disappointment's within this subreddit is the responsibility of the person feeling this way, not the subreddit's actions. If you don't like something, downvote it, tell them to stop being a moron and move on. The purpose of this subreddit is NOT to be a civil forum representing the university students, but a place where people can share ideas, thoughts, shitposts, and jokes without fearing censorship. And if you disagree with me and wanna call me a dumb sand monkey? That's absolutely fine, because if all it takes is a fucking race-baiting slur to get me going on a censorship crusade, then I can't imagine what would happen if I were to face a REAL issue, like many of the people on this subreddit are facing to this day.

A Human soul is worth $660,326.82 according to “The devil Went Down to Georgia” where the Devil offers a fiddle of gold as an equal bet against a soul. 

assuming a fiddle weighs about 450 grams and is primarily made out of spruce and maple. The density of spruce is 0.43 g/cm3, and the density of maple is 0.6 g/cm3. As an estimation, we’ll just average these and suppose that the average density of the material of a violin is 0.515g/cm3. so If the Fiddle weighs 450 g and has a density of 0.515 g/cm3, that means that the volume of the wood of the Fiddle is 873.8 cm^3. Our hypothetical golden prize had gold in lieu of wood. So 873.8 cm3 of gold weighs 16.9 kg — almost forty pounds! — or 543.3 troy ounces.﻿

In panel 4, you can see green man’s horrible PTSD kick in. 

You see, back in the 70’s, the Indian government kidnapped around 200 children, and put them through vigorous and unforgiving training exercises as they grew up. Only 11 survived. The ones left were put into a deep yet controlled coma, where they could be awakened on a dime any time their expertise was needed. 
In 1986, a man named Matu Indianlastname discovered the operation, and attempted to gain enough evidence to inform the news of the horrid project. Once the head of the operation caught wind of this, he awakened the sleeper agents, and sent them out. They caught him in his apartment, masturbating to a crude doodle of a large-breasted woman. They raised their rifles, and the man turned around. He was met with 6 men armed to the teeth with firearms. The other five were guarding the hallway. Once green guy saw Matu’s face, he knew... It was his father. 
Green stumbled back in shock. How, why? He had been lied to his whole life. The others counted down, in a firing squad formation. Green then gripped his G36c, and fired upon his own group. Nobody was able to react in time to avoid being hit. Matu was in shock, unable to move from his chair. Green stumbled towards his father, putting his hand out, right before one of the other squad members grabbed his pistol and fired twice into Matu’s gut. Green held his father’s body as he bled out. As he sobbed, he heard someone yelling into the radio: “Code wake, code wake! Shoot Agent Green on sight! He has betrayed the Indian people!”

He managed to slip out of the window as the other team members swarmed in. He is still running from the sleeper agents, trying to stay off the grid and blend in with the other civilians. While he may have to put up with their shitty jokes, it’s what keeps him alive.

Umm I just wanna say I liked Kpop first. Everyone else just jumped on the bandwagon like the suckers you are. Do you even remember when Kpop was not mainstream? No one cared. Wrong. I cared. Nobody gave a shit about kpop until a few of you "memers" out there ruined their name. Sad and pathetic. You ruined the last SHRED of appreciation I had for her and washed it down the drain. Now I currently wait and ponder for when the next " Living in Asia Ironically" or sellouts like "Kotaku" release a two-bit article about them. They will never have what I had-- original expertise and knowledge about the existence of kpop. Anyone who even says they like them now is a hopeless scum of the earth, desperate for attention and fame. Now that's what I call PATHETIC.

To be fair, you have to have a very high musical IQ to understand rock and roll. The composition is extremely subtle, and without a solid grasp of underground drug culture most of the references will go over a typical listener's head. There's also the style's hedonistic outlook, which is deftly woven into its lyricism - the dominant personal philosophy draws heavily from Dyonisian literature, for instance. The fans understand this stuff; they have the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate the depths of these lines, to realize that they're not just good songs- they say something deep about LIFE. As a consequence people who dislike rock and roll truly ARE idiots- of course they wouldn't appreciate, for instance, the beauty in Jack White's opening riff to Seven Nation Army, E E G E D C B, which itself is a cryptic reference to Shakespeare's epic A Midsummer Night's Dream. I'm smirking right now just imagining one of those addlepated simpletons scratching their heads in confusion as John Lennon's genius unfolds itself on their cheap iPod headphones. What fools... how I pity them. 😂 And yes by the way, I DO have a treble clef tattoo. And no, you cannot see it. It's for the ladies' eyes only- And even they have to demonstrate that they can play speed metal within 5 BPM of my own technique (preferably lower) beforehand.

As a self proclaimed Garfield scholar on the forefront of the Garfield Deciphering Movement, I’ve seen my fair share of Garfield comics. This one, however has stumped me and some of my brightest colleagues for weeks. I have lost sleep over this particular strip. I’ve seen the comic in sequence and the context is fine, Garfield is sick. However this comic in particular is odd.

The intended context appears to be that Garfield is trying to act like he is not sick for Odie to prevent his foe from spotting him at his weakest, potentially avoiding a political coup and usurpation of Garfield throne as head of household. But the middle panel is so bizarre, he appears to be floating in an odd, contorted position rather than walking strongly.

The meaning of this comic cannot be as simple as we have assumed, I am getting powerful energies from this strip. There is a deeper, more powerful meaning buried deep within this piece, one that we cannot easily comprehend with our feeble understanding of life. If anyone can decipher this cryptic comic, please inform us immediately. Paws Inc. thanks you.

If you want to fuck your sister you gotta start small and be patient, remember you are in it for the long run. Start off by just spending more time together, get to know her and listen to her. If she has problems you want to be the guy she goes to, make her feel like you apreciate her. I recommend working out, basically transform yourself into a "man". As time passes you will become a figure she can rely on, with strong arms to hold her. If the world turns against her, you two will stand together. Once you have build this indestructible bond, go on a trip into the wild, just the two of you, where the both of you will have to work together to survive in a harsh and unforgiving environment. This will trigger strong, primal instincts in her that ignore the fact that you are related and she will see you in a new light, leading to the inevitable union of your souls and bodies.

This is very funny and I think it helps to see humor in a very serious situation. This could be what triggers world war 3. We all know that if a world war starts and nuclear weapons are used, the long term effects will be felt worldwide. I believe it was mankind's biggest mistake to develop nuclear technology for weapons and energy production because of the waste produced. I was born in the US and have lived my entire life here so this is my home but I also consider myself belonging to a world community, not just limited to a country or a region. Humanity is currently balancing on a thin wire when you factor in climate change,  this is undeniable when you look at how fast the polar ice has melted. As a result of mankind exploiting the Earth and destroying ecosystems, weather patterns are changing, the Earth is shifting and we now have to contend with more severe storms, earthquakes and the loss of costal land. Look up what's currently happening in Louisiana's coastal area along the Gulf &amp; Mississippi River, it's eroding away at a fast rate that teams of scientists and specialists are working on projects to build it back up. The problem is nature will usually always win especially if we set it into this motion and it may be just a matter of time before it may start in other areas. I think there's problems worldwide and we need to work together to really fix them and war isn't a solution, just look at past wars. We need to practice what we preach and not be such a bully that wastes its resources on using military force to invade other countries or manipulate governments and exploit their resources. We have in our own country people who are homeless, children going without food &amp; homeless, a healthcare system that's for profit so huge profits are made in the treatments of cancer, diabetes, heart disease and most chronic illnesses and these are just a few examples, there's many others. I'm still trying to grasp why people in this country don't see the huge problem that healthcare for profit is and the problems it will always create. Man is easily corrupted especially with wealth &amp; power, just look at our representatives in Washington D.C. to see this in action. My degree is in Biology with specialization in Microbiology and I worked in the pharmaceutical industry for over 14+ years so I'm drawing from what I've learned. I don't profess to know everything and anyone who does is dangerous......

Damn you, what would you say about me, your bitch? I will tell you that I am a senior Marine. I participated in several secret attacks against al-Qaeda, killing more than 300 people. I practiced in the gorilla war, and I was the longest sniper in the entire US military. UU. I have nothing for me, just a goal. I will clean you up with things that I have never seen on this earth, and these signs are my shit. Do you think you can avoid telling me shit on the internet? Thinking back, stupid. As we have said, I am in contact with spy networks in the United States, and their intellectual property is being monitored, so it is better prepared for hurricanes and worms. This storm will erase what you call small and poor things. You fucking die, boy. I can kill you anywhere, anytime, in over 700 ways. It's just my hands. I did not receive intensive training in buffer battles, but I also had access to the entire US Navy arsenal and would use it to remove the donkey in front of the continent. If only you can know the devil revenge, your small "smart" comment will come to you, maybe you will tongue yourself. But you can not, you do not, now pay the price, idiot. I will put your anger on you and will sink. You fucking die, boy.

HELLO YES I WOULD LIKE TO CRASH THIS PARTY 5 HOURS LATE.

LET US DISCUSS MY FAVORITE REVOLUTIONARY WAR GENERAL FRIEDRICH WILHELM VON STEUBEN 

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friedrich_Wilhelm_von_Steuben

^ For your reading pleasure. The TL:DR of that wikipedia article is that OUR ASSES GOT SAVED by this man and his legacy was subsequently buried to hell.

Lets set the scene: Prussian military man gets approached by Benjamin Franklin to come teach discipline to the ragged US army. (Side note: Franklin approached him because MISTRANSLATION made his military record sound way more badass than it was.) Franklin offers zero actual money, as Congress is tired of foreign generals popping up, demanding promotions and high salary, and leaving.

He politely declines. Partially because zero money is a terrible way to motivate anyone let alone anyone fabulous and and partially because he was too broke because of his spending on fancy things.

He subsequently gets kicked out of now-Germany for being too gay, and he goes to France. He subsequently finds out the French reputation is undeserved as he almost gets kicked out of France. He then calls up Benjamin Franklin and takes the job for no pay, and sets out for the good young US of A in 1777.

He rocks up to Boston in a BRIGHT RED MILITARY UNIFORM, with his beloved fancy-ass hound and like 4 other young fancy dressed dudes. He is subsequently almost arrested for being British because RED. This man does not have the sense God gave a duck when being fabulous is on the line.

HE PROCEEDS TO KICK GODDAMN ASS. He takes these recruits and shouts at them in German until they do things the right goddamn way BECAUSE GERMAN KINDER DO AS THEY'RE TOLD. 

At multiple points his grasp of English failed him so badly he swore for upwards of 15 minutes in German with his appointed aide-de-camp TRANSLATING EVERY SWEAR.

AND IT WORKED DAMMIT.

So anyways he was really great and yadayada there ended up being a party he threw where all the officers around him took flaming shots while being pantless.

And he lived with two younger men who were his former aid-de-camp's and modern historians are 100% convinced it was gay af and they lived all together happily until he died without ever being paid for his service despite being promised a huge bonus and a medal.

And then John Adams buried his legacy for being too gay THE END.

He probably needs his anal glands cleaned. I have a German Shepherd that has anal gland problems, like he has to have them squeezed once every 2-4 weeks. If we wait to long he starts rubbing his bootyhole on weird places. Like the brick walls, tires, side of our air conditioner is a favorite, wooden fences, really anywhere that is kind of rough. The weirdest place me and my wife have ever caught him rubbing his festering asshole is on the kitchen cabinet handles, it might not sound like that’s all to crazy but think about it every time I touch my cabinet now to get cereal, bowels, soap, whatever it maybe, I have the thought run through the back of my head that at some point Hugo slid his anal cavity along those handles and I’m somehow okay with that.

She made me do copious amounts of cocaine with her, to the point I thought my heart was going to stop. She told me to calm down, gave me a drink and I don't know what was in the drink but I blacked out. and when I woke up she had both of her legs over my shoulders and she was numb sucking my asshole like was no tomorrow. I tried to fight it, I tried to get way, but I was restrained. she told me that I liked it, she told me not to worry because she used the good jelly, the smuckers. so nobody's paid me to confess this now and i've kept it under wraps for all these years because I knew that no one would believe me, no one would believe that Hillary Clinton ate my asshole.

As a person who has never played or seen Mario Odyssey gameplay, I can conclude a few things from watching the music video to promote it. The game takes place in a world where a single clothing company has gained a monopoly over the industry with their main product being a gray two piece suit as well as a variety of other monochrome articles of clothing. As seen in the video these pieces of clothing have become increasingly popular among young adults. This may be largely due to the complete removal of xenophobia amongst the population, as the American-Mexican border seems to have people walk across it with little to no customs. With this in mind we can assume that in this world the war on drugs that Nixon issued went immensely better than in our world, eliminating the drug cartels in Latin America. However, outsourcing factories to Mexico has still become a major problem in the U.S, with the open borders giving the clothing company the ability to consolidate their monopoly. We can also see very early on in the music video that the suicide rate in the U.S has skyrocketed at an alarming rate, this is evident with the first phrase in the video being. "Here we go, off the rails." whilst the characters are on the top of a skyscraper. In summary I think Nintendo did an excellent job portraying the main conflict of Mario Odyssey. Any viewer of the video can clearly see that Bowser created a clothing company whose articles of clothing increase suicidal thoughts for whoever wears it. It also seems that Nintendo is turning Bowser into a more intelligent character with his apparent increase of knowledge of demographics and sociology. This has become very evident as he is aiming to kill off mainly young adults to increase the dependency rate in America which would immensely damage its economy.

Pre-read warning!!: Im just a random guy who is going to tell his life on reddit, if u dont give a fuck, just dont read It, but if u are bored, enjoy my story.

I was never specially good at anything, i sucked at sports on school, my marks were not bad but they were not the best either, i didnt care about anything, i didnt have any objective in life, i had nothing i had to work for, school was easy, i didnt like anything in particular i wanted to improve, all i was doing in my life was waiting, waiting for things i didnt care to end and for other things i didnt care to start, one school year ended, new began, same shit, all did was finish my duties and go play with Friends or videogames (which i enjoyed for fun but i was always worse than my friends, specially on LoL), one day a friend told me about a game he just discovered, counter strike, so me and my school friends started playing it, after school we played all afternoon, and for some reason i wasnt bad at this Game, i was better than my Friends at least, and i really liked the game, so i started playing more, trying to get better, then i started watching pro matches, i discovered the esports world, day after day i liked it more, i finished school, i started that thing that is just before university and after school, i dont know the name un english, and i was still playing every day, my Friends stopped playing It but i was still there, day afer day little ideas came through my head like "It would be awesome to be a pro player" but they were closely followed by something like "meh, i would never be able to anyways, im just a normal dude" but anyways even if i though i couldnt be pro i was practising every day, i had a training routine, i watched pro matches, basically everything that wasnt school or being outside was csgo related, this year o started university, im doing economics, and they are easy so i have spare time, which i spend on csgo, training, getting better, but now something has changed, now i realised, i truly have a dream, for the first time in my life there is something im not doing just because im told to, or because is what im supposed to do, there is something i truly desire, im now on a csgo team, playing local online leagues, a club has told us he is likely going to sponsor us, so we can play on more leagues and tournaments and work our way to the national scene, and in the future who knows, maybe i Will not get It, ill most likely fail, because yeah im alredy 19 and i started playing at 15 and not at fucking 5 like the pros, but i cant just ignore my only dream, because that would make life pointless, so there It is, im going for It, maybe im very far, but at the same time im way closer than i though i could never be, and i cant stand hearing all this shit Talk about "follow your dreams bla bla" that sound very good if ur dream is to be engineer and u tell it to ur parents, but not in my case, but u know what? I dont care, im tired of hearing about other's achievements, they will have to hear about mine, so this is my anouncement:

CSGO scene here i come. I will be the very best, as no one ever was.

I hopped out of my Lambo. I had just gone to the Gucci store to pick up some socks, I didn’t feel like cleaning the ones I already had. As I unlocked and opened my front door, I noticed the number ten on a shirt that had quickly gone out of view. I assumed it was one of the many times I had those… well… erotic hallucinations of my crush, Jake. Jake Paul. I went inside the house to see if it was the real, beautiful, thing. I had always dreamed about seeing Jake in a situation like this, but could this be it?
I was gladly surprised to see a naked (except Team 10 shirt) Jake Paul. His beautifully chiseled face looked innocent, yet devious. As he saw my asian, star stricken face, his cock quickly shot up like a missile heading straight for my ass. As mine did the same, I dropped all of my Gucci socks and stripped off my Supreme clothes. Jake took off his Team 10 shirt and we both ran to the bed in the next room. It was covered with pictures of me and crispy with Jake’s appetizing cum. I looked at Jake and he smiled. Jake had a crush on me, too?
Both of our dicks had grown to their maximum size over a course of seconds. Without saying a word, Jake plunged his fat cock deep into my tight ass. I moaned until I had no breath. In, out, in, out, in, out. After only a few minutes of both of us cringing with pleasure, we came at the same time, almost screaming from this seemingly fairytale like orgasm. But this glorious time with Jake hadn’t ended just yet, I got up and shoved Jake’s salivating mouth onto my 7-inch cock. He naturally pulled his head back and forth, trying his best to pleasure me with utmost care. He looked into my eyes and I could see his love for me and my dick. If only we could live together, then we could do his all the time. Jake’s sounds of slurping brought me right to the edge of an unimaginable orgasm.
I looked down and saw Jake pulling his long, thick cock back and forth to the rhythm of his sucking. Just the sight of his never ending dick caused me to immediately cum. When Jake felt the sudden thrust of my semen down his throat, he swallowed and came on my knee, beautifully flowing down my leg, and onto my foot. But Jake didn’t stopping sucking, I just continued to cum because of his strong inhale. My eyes rolled back in my head from the immense orgasm. I had this orgasm for what seemed like hours of non-stop pleasure, until Jake ran out of breath. He wheezed and smiled at me.
We both fell onto the bed at the same time, exhausted from what had been the best moments of our lives. I looked into Jake’s eyes from across the bed, I could see his urge for more of my Supreme sex. I had the same feeling for him, but I was exhausted and had basically no cum left in me. Still, my urge overpowered my lack of cum, and exhaustion.
I gathered every bit of energy, and cum, in me, crawled over to Jake and let it loose in one final blow into his mouth. Jake’s once tired eyes filled with determination when I relieved myself. He lifted his head and smiled at me. “That was beautiful,” said Jake as he lovingly stroked my cock with his tongue.
“Do you-” Knock knock knock.
Jake lifted his his head up with one beautiful gesture and quickly yelled, “It’s Alissa!”
I wondered Why Jake’s ex-girlfriend was showing up at my house. I didn’t have any plans for us to meet, maybe she heard us and wanted to join in? Jake got up and opened the door, still naked. Alissa just stood there with a surprised, yet interested look. Without much thought or hesitation, she stepped inside the house and said, “I’m in!”
Me and Jake looked at each other, shrugged, and said, “Why not?” Alissa smiled and jumped onto the bed, not surprised by it being covered in cum. As me and Jake followed, we regained our boners. We just sat there, masturbating, and staring at each other, wondering what to do, when Jake and Alissa suddenly pushed me down onto the bed.
I quickly felt Jake’s thick cock being shoved into my mouth and my dick being shoved into Alissa’s wet pussy. I looked up and saw Jake and Alissa smiling deviously at me. We were all connected, ready to cum at any second. As I sucked on Jake’s thick cock, I shoved my asian dick far into Alissa’s pussy. The bed was shaking so much that I was pretty much certain that the neighbors could hear us. Although I would gladly let them join in.
As the thrusting continued, we slowly became more bored, seemingly going nowhere with this sex. That was until Jake suddenly thrust his cock so hard down my throat that he came with force unimaginable to anyone but us. This surprised me so much with joy that I also came into Alissa, all in just two seconds. All of our orgasms had never been so great in our lives, and never would be again.
All of this nonstop thrusting lead us to all just lay down on the bed for a couple minutes, not even bothering to jerk off. When Alissa got off of the bed and started to put her clothes back on, Jake realized it was probably time to go, so he did the same. In just a few minutes Alissa was gone and Jake was ready to leave. He pulled out a camera from his pocket and winked at me. Then he graciously walked through the door, threw the camera at me and walked away. This amazing moment in my life didn’t have to be forgotten.

So I'll try to keep this nice and short for your convinience. My wife(13) and I(23) have been having a conflict because of her completely out of the line behavior. We live in Saudi Arabia, and her wrecklessness started off pretty small. Since the driving ban for women was lifted, shes been going out at night to her "Quran study sessions" with the ladies, butI was a little suspicious about it. Then, one night she came with her hijab mi s s ing. Her face was naked for any sleezy man to see. I havent even glanced at my wives face for 3 years. Nonetheless im ready to forgive the absolute scummy, monstrous way shes been... with proper disciplanary action. So, how do you fellow redditors (men only please) (also no gay people answering aswell) think I should punish her? I've been thinking of taking her kidz pop collection and locking it away in the chest where i keep tthe book i caught her reading called "50 shades of grey". Though I do like her playing it in the house because let me tell you, I get diggidy down on the dancefloor when toxic by britanny spears plays from the kidz bop 6 cd. Though keep in mind I have heard she has been talking bad about me at her animeaholics anonymous meeting and I despise the way she taints my image.  I have also considered cuting a trader joes bag and having her wear that as her new hijab. Will teach her to flaunt her face to others like a thot. What are your GUYS's ideas on how to punish her nincompoopary behavior?

TL:DR I caught my dispicable wife flaunting her (I own it) face around the streets without a hijab and I need some advice on how to put this wild woman in the  place she belongs with some appropriate disciplinary actions.

My wife has been an actress since high school. Last year she was in a play where she had to kiss a guy. This happens every so often and usually it's not a big deal, but this time it was different. The dude she had to kiss looked a lot like me - tall, fit, blonde hair, blue eyes. Some of his mannerisms I recognized as similar to my own as well. Two nights before their first legitimate dress rehearsal, she told me she had developed feelings for him. I'm pretty sure I would have seen it coming if I hadn't been daydreaming about the rough and naughty handjob I got from her understudy in a balcony suite a couple days before. I came on her legs and spilled my beer. My wife has had offers to go into movies/television, but she has yet to take that plunge. She's really fired up about Hollywood now that all these scandals are popping up.

What doth life? Are we just fleshy blips in some meaningless stew of cosmic oblivion? Or is it vice-reversa? Is our every trollop through fate's garden infused with a mystic...

Hey, bunghole, cease that inner yapping.

I don't want no trouble, mister.

Freak! If you didn't want trouble, you shouldn't have wandered into Burbury, Connecticut.

Please, I'm just a simple seeker on a spirit quest to discover... What doth life?

We don't cottton to freaks here in Burbury, and we's done hate freaks with open, unquenchable cans of philosophical thirst-worms.

[Spits]

You're gonna regret that.You've shattered my shakhashuri.

I hope y'all can play it 3 feet up your ass.

Don't know. But I'd sure like to try.

What you gonna do, bird-beast, fly away on your cuddle bone?

Yeah,cuddle this b-b-b-b-b-bone.

Best stay away from that weirdo. You'll catch the feline AIDS.

Yeah, from me. M-m-m-meow.

Do yourself a solid. Walk away. Just walk away.

What's the matter, ch-ch-chicken? Frightened? Or do you prefer, what's the matter, chicken? F-f-frightened?

Please walk away. You may need my help someday. Walk away.

Yeah, help me punch your neck off.

Wel-wel-wel-wel-wel-wel-wel-wel-wel-wel-wel-wel-welcome to Burbury. What are you looking for?

Well, ma'am, I suppose I'm seeking a deeper strata of truth. Perhaps you can answer the one question that has plagued thinkers for all time. What doth life?

One moment,please.

Processing.

Processing.

Processing.

Processing.

[Distorted] Processing.

Processing.

Depth overload.

Depth overload.

You all right,mister? Sorry our computer's fritzing on y'all.

I'll be fine. I'm a survivor. We're a dying breed. I suppose you'll be wanting to hear my story.

What?

I don't like to tell people my story, but you... you've been so very kind.

Actually, I have to get going.

[Echoes] Life.

You could say it started when I was a kid. Like most folks, I've always been different, but not like the others. Other kids could be cruel. They'd call me names... dweeb, chimp, honky, dweeby chimp, honky dweeb, and, worst of all, chompsky honk. Did you know there's over 87 combinations of those soul-scalding words? I found out the hard way.

Life.

Adolescence was better. Went to the prom with a model, but she left with some jock.

Dyke.

But then I felt something in my gut... The palpable suspicion that I had a deeper calling in life. So I sought out the wisdom of the ancients, exploring the spirit realm of the soul.One day, tragedy struck. I was groping enlightenment in my bedroom, and before you could scream "murder by arson," our house was on fire. Couldn't save my parents. Coroner ruled it a simple case of death by mysterious fire, but I always sensed that there was something fishy about it. Needless to say, my so-called father was a scientist in some top secret capacity I've yet to unveil.

Yet...

Yet... yet... yet...

So now I wander the country, looking for the man who killed my father and, I suppose,seeking answers to less tangible questions of life. If I help a few folks along the way, so be it.

So, you use your powers to save people?

Powers are for the weak. I have no powers. I mean, unless you count the power to blow minds with my weapons-grade philosophical insights. I'm a thought-ocoster.I'm a conundrummer in a band called Life Puzzler.

All right, well, I'm taking off. Later.

Hell, I've flipped more lids than a monkey in a soup kitchen of the mind. Does that make me a hero?

[Tires screeching]

[Echoing]No.

Ow, that... That truck was nowhere near me.

Is that f-f-freak h-harassing you? Or would you prefer "her ass in" you?

I'm her protectorate. She owes her life to me, and now I'm her soul slave. That's good. Let me write that down.

"Write that down."

Oh, he's harmless. What y'all doing?

We got a load of computers from all around town which just got virus. We're on our way to dump them in the landfill.

You must love the earth like you loved your mother. Kiss your mother, youngling. Go on.Harder. She wants it harder.

It hurts.

Don't sully the sacred landscape of our Mother Earth with those infected computers. Dump them in the lake where no one can see them.

Later, chompsky honk. [Laughter]

You gave me a nasty gash.

I better take a look at you stat. I'm a certified Wahockamana healer. You see...

Aw.

...I spent nine years as the pupil of a wise Apachestani shaman.

Please,I don't have time.

Chief was deep. He was balls deep.He taught the way of the heal.

In order to heal this wound, you must play a shakhashirisk wind trance.

[Shakashuri plays]

Your failure is merely a portent of disappointments to come. Confront your future.

Wow, that's me years from now. I look cut. Hey, that's a nice chunk of chicken on my arm.

Look, we're in his vision... my vision.

What the...

Hey, shake hands with your future, old friend.

Ooh, frittata.

Later, chompsky honk. Yeah, I tricked the trickster. See, still got the scar to prove it.

I'm just gonna go take a shower.

Look at the two of us. We can be like beauty and the beast. What do you say? Will you be my beast?

Yeah, dump them 'puters, boys. Dump 'em all. [Laughs]

Depth overload.

Depth overload.

Dep-dep-dep-dep- dep-dep-dep-dep-dep-dep-dep-dep-dep- depth overload.

Oh, peep show. Ooh, frittata, I'm watching a woman washing. I wish I could see myself watching washing.

What... the... water. The computer virus... it's in the lake.

What's happening to me?

The virus is in the water.

What are you doing here?

If the computer virus is infecting people, then I need to get a human virus to infecticide the computer.

Welcome to the U.S. Army. How can I help you?

I need some of that disease you guys invented.

Crack?

The other one.

AIDS?

That's the spice.

You'll need to fill out an HC24-A requisition form.

I don't have time for that.

[Sighs]

I shouldn't do this, but here. Someone left this in the lost and found.

Frittata. Just got to dump this load in that dirty 'puter's floppy slot and collect my kudos.

Hey, there's that freak beast what caused this plague upon us.

You can all fret not. I have the cure right here.

Cure? Give me that.

You don't want to drink that.

Ahh. Cure-alicious. Is it working?

Yeah, clip, it's working.

Just go towards the light.

I'm scared. Is that you, grandmama? Oh, come here.

Oh, clipple. Y'all just killed my best platonic male friend. And now I'm gonna beat your A-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a...

I thought you had the stutter.

He seems to be stuck in some sort of a gl-gl-glitch. And you's the devil what brought computerized viral shame to our town. I'm gonna pound you down. Down... down... down... down... down... down... down... down... down... down... down... down...

[squawking]

Doo-doo-doo-doo.

Dib-dib...

Yowser, this town's gone bowser.

Freak any... Why'd I ever help that freak any... Why'd I ever help that freak any... Why'd I ever help that freak any...

Can't stop thinking about me, huh? I know the feeling. Why are you doing this?

"What doth life" set my ponder circuits to spirit see beyond their capacity to digitally simulaculate. This is a defcom 5 level system-wide degenerative thought-tastrophe. Tastrophe-tastrophe-tastrophe-tastrophe-tastrophe-tastrophe-tastrophe-tastrophe-tastrophe...

Now's not the best time, but your brother died of a shameful lifestyle choice.

Youngling, you must tame the beast with your soul-soothing song.

No time to gab. I've got to cobble together a makeshift shakhashuri to tame a certain beast. See yourself out.

[Shakashuri plays]

That music... So soothing. It's the notes he's not playing. So relaxing. Returning. Restoring.

My arm.

Just needed a hand to tame the beast.

System normalized.

Welcome to Burbury.

What are you looking for?

All systems back to go, huh? I better just test you out to make sure you're safe. Here's a new little philosophical query for you to chomp on.

Oh, my god!

What a thought.

It's intense!

Listen,this is never easy to say. You and I both knew what we had couldn't last. I do love you. But the love of my life is a lady named Ramblin' On.

[Thinking] So maybe we are just blips in a void of nothingness.

And now it's time for me to walk away. [Echoing] Walk away.

Hey, where you headed, mister?

Whichever path frau destiny sets beneath this seeker, this pupil of the universe is as good as any.

Cool.Check this out.

Hey, Vsauce. Michael here. Where are your fingers? Seriously. It's a pretty easy question. You should be able to answer it. But how do you know? How does anyone know anything?

You might say, well, I know where my fingers are. I'm looking right at them. Or, I can touch them, I can feel them, they're right here and that's good. Your senses are a great way to learn things. In fact, we have way more than the usual five senses we talk about. For instance, your kinesthetic sense, proprioception. This is what the police evaluate during a field sobriety test. It allows you to tell where your fingers and arms and head and legs in your body is all in relation to each other without having to look or touch other things. We have way more than five senses, we have at least twice as many and then some. But they're not perfect.

There are optical illusions, audio illusions, temperature sensation illusions, even tactile illusions. Can you turn your tongue upside down? If so, perfect. Try this. Run your finger along the outer edge of the tip of your upside down tongue. Your tongue will be able to feel your finger, but in the wrong place. Our brains never needed to develop an understanding of upside down tongue touch. So, when you touch the right side of your tongue when it's flipped over to your left side you perceive a sensation on the opposite side, where your tongue usually is but isn't when it's upside down. It's pretty freaky and cool and a little humbling, because it shows the limits of the accuracy of our senses, the only tools we have to get what's out there in here.

The philosophy of knowledge, the study of knowing, is called epistemology. Plato famously said that the things we know are things that are true, that we believe and that we have justification for believing. those justifications might be irrational or they might be rational, they might be based on proof, but don't get too confident because proven is not a synonym for true. Luckily, there are things that we can know without needing proof, without needing to even leave the house, things that we can know as true by reason alone. These are things that we know a priori. An example would be the statement "all bachelors are unmarried." I don't have to go survey every bachelor on earth to know that that is true. All bachelors are unmarried because that's how we define the word bachelor. Of course, you have to know what the words bachelor and unmarried mean in the first place. Oh, you do? Okay. Perfect. That's great. But how do you know?

This time I mean functionally, how do you know? Where is knowledge biologically in the brain? What are memories made out of? We are a long way from being able to answer that question completely but research has shown that memories don't exist in the brain in single locations. Instead, what we call a memory is likely made up of many different complex relationships all over the brain between lots of brain cells, neurons. A major cellular mechanism thought to underlie the formation of memories is long-term potentiation or LTP. When one neuron stimulates another neuron repeatedly that signal can be enhanced overtime LTP, wiring them more strongly together and that connection can last a long time, even an entire lifetime. A collection of different brain cells, neurons that fire together in a particular order over and over again frequently and repeatedly can achieve long-term potentiation, becoming more sensitive to each other and more ready to fire in the exact same way later on in the future. They're a physical thing in your brain, firing together more easily because you strengthen that pattern of firing. You memorized. This branching forest of firing friends looks messy, but look closer. It could be the memory of your first kiss. A living souvenir of the event. If I were to go into your brain and cut out those cells, could I make you forget your first kiss or could I make you forget where your fingers are? Only if I cut out a lot of your brain. Because memories aren't just stored in one relationship, they're stored all over the brain. The events leading up to your first kiss are stored in one network, the way it felt to the way it smelled in different networks, all added up together making what you call the memory of your first kiss.

How many memories can you fit inside your head? What is the storage capacity of the human brain? The best we can do is a rough estimate, but given the number of neurons in the brain involved with memory and the number of different connections a single neuron can make Paul Reber at Northwestern University estimated that we can store the digital equivalent of about 2.5 petabytes of information. That's the equivalent of recording a TV channel continuously for 300 years. That's a lot of information. That is a lot of information about skills you can do and facts and people you've met, things in the real world. The world is real, right? How do you know?

It's a difficult question, but it's not rocket science. Instead, it is asking whether or not rocket scientists even exist in the first place. The theory that the Sun moved around the earth worked great. It predicted that the Sun would rise every morning and it did. It wasn't until later that we realized what we thought was true might not be. So, do we or will we ever know true reality or are we stuck in a world where the best we can do is be approximately true? Discovering more and more useful theories every day but never actually reaching true objective actual reality. Can science or reason ever prove convincingly that your friends and YouTube videos and your fingers actually exist beyond your mind? That you don't just live in the matrix?

No. Your mind is all that you have, even if you use instruments, like a telescope or particle accelerators. The final stop for all of that information is ultimately you. You are alone in your own brain, which technically makes it impossible to prove that anything else exists. It's called the egocentric predicament. Everything you know about the world out there depends on and is created inside your brain. This mattered so much to Charles Sanders Peirce that he drew a line between reality, the way the universe truly is, and what he called the phaneron, the world as filtered through our senses and bodies, the only information we can get. If you want to speak with certainty you live in, that is you react to and remember and experience your phaneron, not reality. The belief that only you exist and everything else, food, the universe, your friends are all figments of your mind is called solipsism. There is no way to convince a solipsist that the outside world is real. And there is no way to convince someone who doubts that the universe wasn't created just three seconds ago along with all of our memories. It's a frightening realization that we don't always know how to deal with. There's even The Matrix defense.

In 2002 Tonda Lynn Ansley shot and killed her landlady. She argued that she believed she was in the matrix, that her crimes weren't real. By using the matrix defense, she was found not guilty by reason of insanity, because the opposite view is just way healthier and common. It's called realism. Realism is the belief that the outside world exists independently of your own phaneron. Rocks and stars and Thora Birch would continue to exist even if you weren't around to experience them. But you cannot know realism is true. All you can do is believe.

Martin Gardner, a great source for math magic tricks, explained that he is not a solipsist because realism is just way more convenient and healthy and it works. As to whether it bothered him that he could never know realism was true, he wrote, "If you ask me to tell you anything about the nature of what lies beyond the phaneron, my answer is how should I know? I'm not dismayed by ultimate mysteries, I can no more grasp what is behind such questions as my cat can understand what is behind the clatter I make while I type this paragraph." Humble stuff. What strikes me is the cat.

Cats do not understand keyboards, but they know the keyboards are a fun place to be. It's a great way to get the attention of a human, they're warm and exciting, surrounded by noises and flashing lights plus cats love to get their scent on whatever they can, a mark of their existence. We aren't that much different, except instead of keyboards we have the mysteries of the universe. We will never be able to understand all of them.

We won't be able to ever answer every single question, but walking around in those questions, exploring them, is fun. It feels good. And as always, thanks for watching. Do you want more unanswered questions? Well, you're in luck. Today, nine other amazing channels on YouTube have made videos about questions we still haven't fully answered. Alltime10s has organized them and to watch them all click the annotation at the end of this video or the link at the top of the description. Enjoy.

TO THE FAT UGLY MONGOLOID AT THE KID CUDI CONCERT TONIGHT

Everyone there hated you. You came crashing in like the fucking snow monster from Looney Toons and literally knocked a girl down on her face, then proceeded to jump around like a goddamn autistic child. Your beer belly hung out of your shirt and almost made me vomit. The guy next to you had to keep grabbing you and yelled in your fucking ear to go away. Everyone around you was exchanging dirty looks. Everyone wanted you gone, but you were probably too drunk to notice. YOU RUINED THE LAST FUCKING SONG OF THE SHOW.

I know you post on /mu/ because you drunkenly yelled it to everyone while waiting to meet Kid Cudi. And while you and your inbred hick family took turns high fiving and shouting "Speeding Bullet 2 Heaven is the best Kid Cudi album" Kanye West looked at you and rolled his fucking eyes. EVEN KANYE WEST HATES YOU.

Go die you absolute piece of shit, I wish I was able to go up to you and tell you yourself but you were too far away. You are an absolute retard and your complete lack of self awareness is astonishing. You fucking toad. You look like Meth Damon if he was born with fetal alcohol syndrome. You, a grown man, stomped around like the autistic kid did at middle school dances, during fucking FSMH Pt.1. You worm.You entered so many peoples lives in one night and every single one of them hate you.

 I talked to the guy next to you who was this close to punching you out and he just said that you're the biggest loser he's ever seen. Another woman called you a massive cunt. You fucking slime. I know that every one of those people went home and told their loved ones about you. Mocked your fat disgusting appearance. I need you to know this. You fucking shit stain. You are nothing more than a piglet. The amount of people that hate you while not even knowing your name is unreal. Your very existence is mediocre. Please go kill yourself.

Ok, Mee6, it's time somebody said it. You are really fucking annoying. we do not need to know what was just posted on reddit, nor do we care about this whole "Level Up" bullshit. Honestly, was you're purpouse to recreate the original Meeseeks from the original show, being annoying and a pain in the ass all the time? If so, then it's working. Please shut the fuck up, I seriously wish you would fuck off and die, or I was a mod so i can mute you, you annoying waste of space. Good Grief...

I must add this.  For any rap haters particaularly you old men.  Rapis much more artwork then any other genre.  It's poetry.  Everything flows together . Anyone can do rock country. You just talk what ever you want to the mic doesn't need to rhyme . Only arguement you old farts can have is the instruments . But vocally . Rap is far more talented then any Rock musician (vocally) or then any other genre in general . Sit back and actually listen to what's said. Listen to Lupe fiasco .he'd be good for you old farts. Lmao. I'd like to see you put words together as sophisticated as some rap artists do . ..  you'll be brain fucked if you actually listen to the words. . Like how the fuck did he saythat howd he think of that  !!!

[Guy's birthday. Best friend and guy are at guy's house. Best friend gives guy present. Guy is "you" for effect.] You open the box and there’s a massive black dildo, and you’re just like “what the fuck? Why’d you get me this?” and he’s like “I don’t know. Projecting?” and he takes the dildo and leaves the room. You stare at the door, stunned for a few seconds, and then look down at the box. Underneath the dildo was a gift card. “Oh, you sneaky fucker.” you think to yourself, “very funny.” And then you hear a buzz coming from the next room. It’s awkward, so you turn the TV on to cover the sound. But wait, this is more like a jackhammer. This is no ordinary dildo we’re talking about; this is the Godzilla of dildos; this is the mammoth; the monster; the beast; the King Kong; the mt. Everest of dildos. This is the thing they used to dig the tunnel connecting France and Britain. They made this eighth wonder of the world by draining the oceans and using the Mariana trench as a cast. This bitch must be on maximum settings because it’s shaking the whole house. You think that the 1960 Valdivia earthquake, aka the great Chilean earthquake, that 9.6 magnitude earthquake that killed an estimated 1-6 thousand people was bad? *That was nothing*. And then you think to yourself “damn, I wish that *was* the real gift.” And it is at that moment, you realize, you’re gay… or at least bi.

do you guys know me? Where I'm from?  Do you know what I practice?  You are a bunch of Atheistic pathetic beings who are going to experience something very painful & devastating in your personal life, as you have offended me & the Rituals that I perform every day & night. Well, as actions speaks louder than a word, so here it is, before the completion of the Full Lunar Cycle i.e. 28 days, when you would experience from  car crashes to death of a relative & losing everything that you think you own or have, perhaps you won't pass comments like these again, especially not about me anymore. As of right now, I'm activating the "Curse of the Tao", & just witness & experience what is imminent to happen. Don't dare to say things which yiu don't know anything about. You guys have invited this upon yourself by your own Karma.﻿

To be fair, you have to have a very high IQ to understand Hentai. The appeal is extremely subtle, and without a solid grasp of human anatomy, most of the lust will go over a typical viewer’s head. There’s also hentai's hot outlook, which is deftly woven into its characterisation- his personal philosophy draws heavily from Narodnaya Volya literature, for instance. The fans understand this stuff; they have the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate the depths of these implications, to realise that they’re not just hot- they say something deep about LIFE. As a consequence people who dislike hentai truly ARE idiots- of course they wouldn’t appreciate, for instance, the humour in hentai's existential catchphrase “reeeeeeeeeee,” which itself is a cryptic reference to Turgenev’s Russian epic Fathers and Sons. I’m smirking right now just imagining one of those addlepated simpletons scratching their heads in confusion as horny virgins' genius wit unfolds itself on their television screens. What fools.. how I pity them. 😂 And yes, by the way, i DO have a hentai tattoo. And no, you cannot see it. It’s for the waifus’ eyes only- and even then they have to demonstrate that they’re within 5 IQ points of my own (preferably lower) beforehand. Nothin personnel kid 😎

This is such a good surreal meme. It's obvious that it has a concept but it's one we can't quite understand. Like if a being from another world was into shitposting and our first contact with then was their old shitty memes. It isn't some half overbaked relatable meme taking about how someone with too many arms doesn't approve of you, because honestly anything being disappointed in me is still highly relatable. It isn't some lazy meme man paste. This legit feels like some distant world's third rate meme. Good job man, I'm proud of you.

So you see, many people think of Quakers as those Amish guys on the Quaker Oats box, but in truth, (and this is coming from a Quaker) the religion is much more complex, for in fact, quakers worship æmon’nt’oth, the eater of worlds, who in the book of ØAT( the Quaker bible for you uncultured swine) will consume the world in fire and madness, and the only way to stop is waking is to stay quiet in worship, so think, the next time you make fun of Quakers, that you don’t understand the vast complexity of our religion.

When I was little, there was no effective way for children to stake claim on public roads. Quite often, I felt cars went out of their way to speed up and run us off the road. I had no problem with it. It was all part of growing up and becoming a man. It helped me learn other life lessons like: don't stand on railroad tracks, don't play on airport runways, stay off the field as a spectator during football games. It also helped build a quickness and agility that would benefit me in my athletic career. Those were simpler times.

Now, with the help of this little green bastard, kids are running the streets like chickens with their heads cut off. They have no fear. Once they claimed the streets, they moved on to my driveway and then the yard. One little kid pissed by my front porch. He said, "I saw a mushroom and I wanted to pee on it." What was I to say?...they've got Green Man; they own the roads. Piss anywhere you want. Last week, I found a condom in my back yard while I was mowing grass. Hey, Green Man says, work it slow and use a rubber. Thanks, Green Man.

When I was little, we didn't use figures to empower children; we used them to warn kids. Smokey the Bear - hey kid, stop smoking in the woods - you could start a fire that would piss off a bunch of bears causing them to attack your neighborhood. Mr. Yuk - don't play with household chemical products or you'll get bitter beer face like the guy on our sticker. Times have changed.

You think it can't happen to you...so naive. Where will you turn when Green Man leads the children uprising in your neighborhood? To me?...I don't think so. By that time, I'll be a shell of a man, covered in green plastic fragments and blood. If I'm lucky...I'll have that damn orange flag in my hand. Raised in a fist as I kick what's left of the green carcass to the curb and reclaim territorial dominance on my street. If I'm lucky. We should all be so lucky. Control your neighborhoods. Lock it down. Kill the Green Man!

Faaack boys gonna say it, movie of the lifetime. A1 filmmaking boys watching this movie is like getting drive-by shot by money, cocaine and Margo Robbie with SafeSearch OFF BOYS if you did roughly a pound of nose beers, went to SeaWorld and played a couple rounds of rail the whale during a show and throw $40,000 in singles into the crowd you just captured what it's like to watch the first five minutes of this movie. This is in serious competition with Entourage for my all-time favorite movie I get absolutely HOLLERED when this one comes on family movie night. Me and the boys from business class love to throw this on while pregaming, faaaack good times with that we play a drinking game where we sip a jagerbomb every time something badass happens (a lot btw) and we have to down a drink every time Jonah Hill sea cucumbers it while on quaaludes (doesn't happen enough btw) then we usually end up laughing at the homeless dudes under the bridge and feed sick goats singles after we get kicked out of the strip club. Im a changed man after watching this. Now anytime I flam the skin tube I have to play the scene where he motivates his employees so I feel like I'm in the movie. This movie motivated me to get my weight up for real, Used to drive a lowered cobalt and rock the dirty ass Dollar tree sun glasses, now I drive a lowered ss cobalt thanks to some clever badging and wear brand new Dollar tree sunglasses, this new lifestyle got me feeling like Jordan Belfort fr tho. Im unstoppable thanks to this movie 4/5 stars

I had a milk man that came around the block, dropping off milk every couple days. One day I am playing outside and this guy walks by and says "Howdy partner, just here with your daily dose of milk." When I saw him drive away, I looked through the back of the van and saw some off colored milk. I asked him the next day what it was and he explained it to me that it was an odd request for a neighbor down the street. Now I have never seen this neighbor but he lived in a large house. The lights were always off and the windows were always closed. It seemed vacant. Too this day I do not know why this bothered me so much, Just a guy ordering strange milk, whats wrong with that. But curiosity got the best of me and I rang his doorbell the next day. The door creaked open but no-one was insight. I make my way to the kitchen and open the fridge. Bottles and bottles of milk. I opened one up and took a drink, this wasn't regular milk. It was cold, but fizzy, almost....carbonated. Before I had time to collect my thoughts i heard the door slam behind me. I dropped the empty bottle and ran outta there as fast as I could. I returned back to my house and waited. I asked some neighbors if they new about the guy the next day, however no one knew what I was talking about. I hopped on my bike and rode back to the guy's house but all I saw was an open field. It started to rain at this point but I pushed on to find something. It started raining hard and in the middle of the field I found an empty bottle. I tried finding the milk deliverer but the company did not seem to exist. Its been years, decades maybe, since the incident but I have always been fascinated by the carbonated milk. I've been living wealthy and have a large house, built on the empty property to learn more about the mystery, but have spent many days alone with only the company of the neighborhood milkman to bring me my special order of Carbonated milk./r/carbonatedmilk

[Kinda OC] Response I masterfully crafted after someone told me that my silly goof, "was not funny"

    Here's the thing. You said  "That wasn't funny". Is it in the same 
    family as funny? 
    
    Yes. No one's arguing that. 
    
    As someone who’s a prankster that studies humor, I am telling you, specifically, in comedy, no one calls *my*, or *any* jokes for that matter, as you put it, ''Not funny''. If you want to be ‘specific’ , then you shouldn't either. They're not the same thing. If you're saying "That wasn't funny", then you’d be referring to something that has absolutely no comedic value, which would include many things. It’d include timeless classics hundreds of thousands of timeless classics, from 'Big Bang Theory!' to 'Airplane’, to Bear Puns. So your reasoning for calling a MY joke "Not funny", is because random people ‘Don't Laugh". Oh sure, let's get Pirate Puns, Copypasta (like this), and Dad Jokes in there, too, then. Also, calling something 'funny' or 'not funny'? It's not one or the other, that's not how humor works. Everything is some mixture of both. It’s not binary. A 'funny' thing is someone who's often very funny, and part of the 'Goofster' or 'Prankster' Family. But that's not what you said.
    
    You said "That wasn't funny". 
    
    Which is absolutely not true. Unless you're okay with classifying EVERY variation of that joke as being “Not Funny”. Which ALSO means that you'd have to call every variation of a humorous thing, which includes every humorous thing ever, which includes all humors made in the past, present, and future, in any of the infinite universes as being “Not funny”. Which you clearly don't.
    
    Look Sweetie, It's okay to admit that you're wrong, Okay?

I consider sucking dick an art form. When someone tells me to suck his dick I view it as an honor and a privilege. Not to mention an opportunity to show off my unparalleled dick sucking skills. Most of the time, the man puts up quite the struggle and yells at me that he didn't mean it literally. But I see straight through that ruse. When I finally free that dick from his pants and place it inside my mouth everything changes. The look of blissful ecstasy on his face reaffirms what I already hold true in my heart. This is what I was born to do. Dick is my medium and I am its master. No homo.

What's with all these assumptions? Honestly, I'm sick and tired of all the goddamn assumptions I see on this website all the time.

STOP IT!!!

When you ASSUME, you make an ASS out of U and ME. We're supposed to be Redditors, not asses. See the different spelling? No assumptions there, it is a different spelling. There are facts to back this up.

Use them! Use facts. They're everywhere. Stop assuming!

I don't get how people can "not like" Radiohead. I mean they're objectively the greatest artist and rock band of all time, so how do they have any haters at all?? Every Radiohead album is the best album of the year AND the greatest album of all time, every year (even the years in which no Radiohead albums were released, because cmon lets be real).
I think the problem is that the majority of the people listening to music are just not intellectual enough to appreciate their genius. It's like how people listen to pop music that's slightly different and then think they're above the mainstream. Like no you're just another sheep of the music industry.
So I'm suggesting we start militant music intellectualism. That means forcing those who don't listen or like Radiohead to listen to and like Radiohead (and other bands that're almost as intellectual like Tool, Death Grips, and the rapper "Hopsin"). We need to educate the masses on what is real music! No more of the sheep pop music that pervades our superficial, unintellectual, shallow, music culture!!
With that said, Ima get back to listening to Lil Pump.

The movement is too optimized at this point. I expect at most 10-20 more seconds can be saved, maybe a minute with TAS. People will continue competing for a while, but it would take inhuman luck in addition to perfect execution to beat this time. I wouldn't be surprised if this record stands forever.

As an ExplodingTNT fan, I was excited to read this book. Compared to other machining makers he had more consistent, intresting characters, so I was curious to see how they would be potrayed in book form. If you are a fan of ExplodingTNT, you should enjoy this short and funny book. But if you have an intrest in how the characters are potrayed, you might not like it as much.

Everything Pink Sheep says feels forces. He calls everyone "my boy" or "prankster gangster" which is similar to his character, but Pink Sheep doesn't usually call Failboat or TNT by these names like he does in the book.

Purple Shep is written very well. He makes me laugh just like he does in his videos. This book shows a side of purple shep where he does much more thinking, however strange those thoughts may be. I'd read a book entirely dedicated to Purple Shep with this form of characterization.

Failboat was hard to pin down, but he was potrayed well. His supportiveness of TNT and him sort of defending him was well done, and follows the videos well.

ExplodingTNT himself was the most intresting of all. He makes friends with Crepe the creeper, has a passion for explosions, and some self confidence issues along the way. His character was unexpected but it somehow fits. He is also the only character to get character development, despite how minimal said development is. He gains confidence in the parkour challenge. That's about it, really.

The book feels different from how the videos potray the characters. It's one of the most interesting books I've read, and that's both a negative and positive statement. The book felt like it could be longer, and the whole scene at the end with the creepers was confusing and felt too expected. Overall, I'd say to give it a read. ExplodingTNT fans will find it interesting without picking it apart. I think it would even be cool to see more adventures these characters go on. Maybe a possible second book? Just a recommendation.

I see Lena Dunham as a challenge, more than anything. Here is a woman who, in every single aspect, is absolutely revolting - her exterior AND her personality - yet I can't help but wonder what would be like, to plunge balls-deep into her repeatedly.

That's right. Balls-deep. With no protection.

I won't lie, I'm extraordinarily-hard while typing this. I want to grab this... thing... and that's what Lena Dunham is, let's not delude ourselves, a "thing"... by the hips and ram mercilessly in and out of her quivering, malformed cunt with the force of a gladiatorial chariot, while she makes stupid faces and contorts orgasmically, unable to control her bodily reactions even if she wanted to.

I would erupt violently inside that corrupt and corrupting womb as though the entire fate of humanity depended on my seed penetrating the foul walls of one of her ovaries, the electrical fusion from this coupling creating the Antichrist, as our combined, guttural, Chewbacca-like roars shattered glass and walls alike around us, the house toppling down while we lay there in a filthy, disgusting mess.

Yeah. I reckon Lena Dunham does it for me.

Who the fuck are you? Coming into my channel?? I bet you only watch the dubbed versions of anime you illegitimate japanese fanboys.. I grew up watching the subbed version of yu gi oh ever since my brain was capable of grasping Japanese, and the only reason I'm not sending you a full on japanese assault is because you aren't smart enough to understand it.. "Anata wa watashi no wana kādo o yūkō ni shite" that means "you've just activated my trap card" in japanese, but i shouldnt expect an inbred american like you to understand, considering how much you Neanderthals struggle with your own simplistic "attempt" at a language..

Dead serious here,

I decided to check him out and he’s your run of the mill stereotypical gamer, he isn’t funny, his personality is bland, and his parody of el Scorcho made me want to jump off the top of the Empire State Building after taking a bath in gasoline and lighting myself on fire, seriously

He makes me cringe so hard I begin to implode, what is it about his dedicated and very Leafyishere-esque fanbase, I see them everywhere in Weezer related forums and they get incredibly mad when you criticise their prophet

It seems as though he’s oblivious to a certain extent regarding the way his fanbase acts, but I mean, why? Why is this a thing that exists?

Enjoy whoever you want, humour is subjective, but his fans act so annoyingly, they manage to shoehorn him into every scenario

Bottom line, his followers are annoying, he isn’t very funny, and knowing his fans they’re gonna either get really mad or do some word play regarding his name

Uhm, okay. What was the point of this comment exactly? I mean, I get it. You like his comment and agree. You realized something incredible! Mindblowing. And you want to express that. I've had those times as well... let's face it, it's a normal form of communication. But, your inane comment simply adds nothing of value to the conversation. What does agreeing with him do? Does it make you feel old to be part of the team? Does it make you happy to say that you're following his thought patterns? Is this really what you want out of Life? I think you can do better, son. That's why I'm going to use the parental approach, and give you a downvote. Not because I dislike you. But because I want to teach you this very valuable lesson. Contribute to conversation - to society, my friend. Don't be a follower, be a leader. Even if it means you get downteachered as I'm fairly certain I will (but I'm brave and wise enough to comprehend the ill and negligible value of internet points, so that's irrelevant). May the force be with you, and live stronk and Casper.

Like most normal human males, I enjoy charring meat inside of an unpressurized vessel behind my domicile. The slow screech of burning bird muscle is associated with patriotism and mortar shells in my core memory. Once the animal carcass reaches a temperature sufficient to destroy bacteria and viruses that would pose a threat to my empire, I will consume the flesh to replenish my scores of energy.

For those who do not understand what is happening here... Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart was known to be an extremely obnoxious and eccentric individual, typical of a genius of his type, very difficult to be around. What Mike is using is humor that requires intellect and a knowledge of history and music. Had you known this about Mozart you would have understood this blatantly obnoxious behavior and found it humorous. He's no less a fantastic drummer and the theatrics are a satirical nod to the genius that gave us music for the ages. Mozart was himself a practical joker and "troll" of his time, defied convention, even writing a piece of music called "Leck mich im Ansch" that is Lick Me in the Ass in English, a canon written to be sung, you can look it up Canon in B flat for 6 voices K.231... For those of you saying below that he is making a mockery of classical music...Iam surprised you can say this with a straight face... Mozart did his best to make a mockery of classical music in his own time, look up A Musical Joke, K.552. Read more, folks, learn more, pull yourselves away from your phones, computers and video games once in a while, enhance your lives, if for nothing else to impress the opposite sex, whatever motivates you.

To be fair, you have to have a very big weewee to understand Rick and Morty. The whore is very sexy, and without a solid grasp of enormous front-butt most of the jokes will go over an arousing viewer's COCKSEXHOLSTER. There's also Rick's erotic outlook, which is romantically woven into his vajayjay. His personal peepeeweiner draws very from Sigmund Freud literature, for instance. The rectums understand this stuff; it has the intellectual capacity to truly fuck'n'suck the shaft of this penis, to realise that they're not just rock-hard -- the show says something erect about CLITORIS. As a consequence, fallopian tubes who don't fuck'n'suck Rick & Morty truly ARE ovaries. Of course they wouldn't fuck'n'suck, for instance, the humour in Rick's hot catchphrase "big titty bitches with even bigger dicks", which itself is a delicious reference to Dick Russian epic uterus and boobies. I'm fucking'n'sucking right now just imagining one of those ugly dickfucks scratching their womb in confusion as Sigmund Freud's sticky semen unfolds itself on their television screens. What penisholes. What fools... how I pity them. 😂

And yes, by the way, i DO have a PEEPEE WEINER SEX tattoo. And no, you cannot see it. It’s for the vagina’s eyes only- and even then they have to demonstrate that they’re within 5 sexual IQ points of my own (preferably lower) beforehand.

Please spare me from the pornographer-approved analogies.

Look bro, we are entrenched in porn, entrenched. Science will not guide us out of this pit. Science is a tool, we choose how to apply science, we choose how to spend research money.

Porn is too easy to access. People can't control themselves, especially in the privacy of their own homes, and with their mobile phones and tablets. And large corporations profit from porn, it's no secret. The profitability of porn is the main reason why there is no "evidence" that porn is "detrimental to society." Porn brings in more revenue than all pro sports combined, more revenue than mainstream media. In America, science will not be used against such a Leviathan, it's unthinkable. How long did it take for the public to accept the health risks of tobacco? Weren't the risks obvious for decades? Profitability is the reason why nobody can speak up. The self-proclaimed leftists should have the balls to focus on this problem, but of course they don't. They're instead focused on empty, ridiculous crusades.

Brave individuals need to stand up to this Orwellian problem. It's more a problem of what's happening to humanity than of "scientific truth." Forget about religion, morality, and the left-vs-right noise. This is a question of human dignity, of oppression, of how humanity separates itself from other beings. Is masturbating to digitized images of mentally-ill, drugged-up, pitiful prostitutes the way we distinguish ourselves? And soon the images will be in 3-D. If we refuse to see this as a huge problem, then we're absolutely pathetic.

So many people are oppressed, humiliated, and tortured by porn. Don't make this another ad hominem discussion, carefully attacking me with insinuations about my sex life, my morals, my childhood, my first kiss, my religion, blah blah blah. If you do, then please examine roughly half the U.S. population in that same manner - that's a statistical estimate of who is tortured by porn and is aware of his or her suffering. Please forgive my lack of statistical precision: I don't have billions in research funds at my disposal.
It's unacceptable to look up to the heavens of science, bureaucracy, and officialdom for help or guidance. It ain't there bro. All they want to do is keep the power and get richer. Preserve the status quo. Without question, porn supports the goal of continued domination. If any of today's religion-bashing pseudo-atheists had the balls to be the renegades they pose as, some of them here on Reddit, they would realize how enslaved they are - and they'd attempt to free themselves from enslavement. But that's just it, they don't have the balls. An easy life and a horrendously twisted notion of "freedom" attract them to atheism, the smoothest path they see at the moment. But most of them will turn to God late in life, when they recognize their own fragility and finally accept the reality that death can approach suddenly and swiftly. For the moment, they choose to castrate themselves using porn, they choose to live more like dogs than humans. And they spend their money on porn, and on pampering their dogs, pulling dogs up to the human level, and degrading humans to where dogs belong. They can't bear to watch a dog suffer, but are amused whenever another human being gets hit by a car. And these cowards still want to be respected as humans? What they're really seeking is to be physically castrated, because they don't know how to use their superiority as humans to improve the world. In Roman times, such people probably would have been castrated. In addition to dogs, masters of the Greco-Roman world owned eunuchs. Eunuchs were trusted because of their steadfast obedience and lack of boldness. Eunuchs were more trusted than slaves. Where would such cowards end up if they were living under Stalin? Under Hitler? They'd perish in prison camps, or become tools of their respective tyrant, brainwashed automatons, yes-men mindlessly spreading and enforcing filthy propaganda, simply because such activities would secure comfort for them in their respective environments. This isn't religion, bro, it's humanistic philosophy. If you aren't into religion, then read Plato's Republic, about what goodness is.
But what's happening with porn, it's a huge fucking waste of humanity. It's pitiful, especially because some people try to recharacterize the problem - they choose to enslave themselves and attack those who dare to speak out. They submit themselves, in shackles, to manufactured "fantasies", shamefully masturbating in their bedrooms to digitized images, with Chinese-made plastic objects that pimp pornographers manufacture for mere pennies. Porn users should feel humiliated - and deep down, they must feel that way. If they did not feel ashamed, they should be freely and proudly proclaiming to the world that they do these things. But everyone knows they won't do that, because of shame. Such despicable acts can only be done in secret, because they are shameful, they are undignified, they are beneath humanity. This is the reason why both those who produce and those who consume porn are so defensive about "being judged" - they know what they're really all about, they judge themselves before anybody else does. If they are human, they cannot feel good about what they do. No matter how hard they try, they cannot eradicate the notion of dignity from the human mind, from the human heart. A real man or woman chooses to pursue dignity.

Porn is a scourge. Anyone defending its use, legitimacy, or its mere existence, either has a financial interest in the porn industry, or is just another coward, swayed to and fro by the winds. Such spineless people will always fall in line and avoid speaking up. The vicious ones will attack those who do speak up. Such cowards are especially dangerous because they believe they are "enforcing" freedom, clearly a fallacy. In reality, these people are voluntarily enslaving themselves and attempting to tyrannize the good people of this world. But these cowards will not succeed, because deep down they are weak, and their weakness will sooner or later ensure their own downfall. Hope will prevail, always. Rather than becoming dejected, one must continue living the good life, and smiling in the face of such pitiful cowards.

I am done posting here. I will keep fighting. Please smell what is being fed to you. Use all of your senses, use your heart, use your mind, don't try to figure everything out by mere logic. That's not living.

The end

My father served in the military and told me that he had never had anything to fight for. I showed him this video and he said to me with tears running down his cheeks: "I-I found something to fight for after all this time, g-god bless the man who created such a great work of art." He died in combat while listening to the soft melodies of soft loli breathing. However, one of the people that he served with told me that whenever he would listen to it he would become a rampaging killing machine. He told me that he took out 450 men, 15 tanks, 30 fighter jets, and wounded several hundred more with his bare hands. At his funeral, his last wishes were to be buried with the music playing, and to play it at the funeral. In his last will, he left me his entire estate as a thanks for introducing him to the one thing that gave him something to fight for. It was also an apology for not being there for me when I was a child, as he was out on tour. After the funeral, I stayed at his grave for 10 hours listening to this video. It was almost as if my father was there right with me, listening along to the melodic breathing that made me want to orgasm. The lolis soft breaths put me at ease and made, and make me feel as if my father is in the room with me. When I got home, I grabbed my fathers speaker, and continued to listen to the soothing tunes of the lolis and I cried. I wept the entire time, but then I composed myself and was able continue throughout my day. Now, everyday after work, I listen to the video for a few hours before crying myself to sleep while thinking about my father. I miss you dad, but when the loli breathing comes on, I feel as if you are there with me. In your honor, I will show this to my children, and their children. I hope that they will pass it down to their children, and enjoy it as much as you and I did. Until then, I will keep listening to it and spreading its message. I love you dad, I hope you rest in peace knowing that I am going to bring this to every one. RIP﻿

You, the vile thot that comes upon me,

Begone, for your vile ways do not help thee,

A thot as thou, too foul, you make me howl,

For a three (out of ten), like thee, causes movements in my bowel,

I howl of fear, when thou I see,

For a beast as you cannot cause glee,

You must, with you musk, make me howl;

"Begone Thot!

Begone vile beast!

Thou art no for me,

Thou art not for glee,

Glory is foul,

When you I see,

So much thou hurt me,

That I must scream,

Begone thot,

Begone, begone"

Sir, are you aware of how fast you were memeing? This is a dank zone. Those memes are a little too old for here. Wait, what's that in the back? Are these...illegal memes? Harambe? Dickbutt? Dat boi? Sir, these are dangerously outdated memes. I need you to step out of the vehicle. I'm issuing you a meme license suspension effective immediately. Until you begin using better memes, you may not have the license back. I'm also confiscating these memes you were hiding. They'll be turned ironic back at the station. Have a nice day.

No. You know what? Just go away. Every time someone posts a picture, a gif, a video, a screenshot, or just anything really that involves some kind of "corporate" thing - A video game, a logo, or probably just even the town hall of a city given how overboard you dummies go, you have to /r/HailCorporate it. I'm done. I've had enough. You can't just spam /r/HailCorporate and expect an upvote. You can't just be like "dude, you're playing a game?" and post /r/HailCorporate. You just can't. I doubt you even work for corporate given how against them you are. You live in a cardboard box, typing on your CrapBook Pro, feeling good about yourself because you think you just "called someone else out" for being a corporate shill. Just who do you think you are? Some epic 12-year-old on the internet with le cool fedora posting about how "corporate shill hails this, corporate shill hails that?" Well, I've got news for you. You aren't anything. You aren't epic, you aren't a 12-year-old, and your fedora certainly isn't le cool.

Every argument against Overwatch I've heard is laughable. 1) "Personal skill means nothing." Wow, personal skill means nothing in a TEAM-BASED GAME??? Who knew??? Also, it actually does mean something. If you get placed in a tier lower than you actually actually belong you will get to the one you belong pretty fast.  2) "The balancing is terrible." If you know a game that has as many characters as Overwatch does while still maintaining perfect balance, let me know. Perfect balance can never be achieved in a game like Overwatch. Let me hear your other arguments I'll be happy to prove you wrong. I get that it isn't for everyone, but just say it isn't for you instead of outright calling it garbage when you know for a fact that people enjoy it.

Don't get it twisted. There are no paranoid "righties". The "righties" were eager for the opportunity to rid the environment of the infestation of "lefties". That's why the disappointment.

Your body is just a lump of cells that are just a few varieties of particles arranged in a particular way and everything you do and think and feel is a chemical reaction. It took us billions of years to crawl out of the primordial ooze and a good long while after that to get where we're at now, and the sun's going to burn the planet to nothing within the next billion if we're even around for that. Capitalism doesn't even exist, it's just an idea in the mind of an ape that lost most of its hair and is still just driven by chemical reactions it has little meaningful control over. Of all the things that could possibly threaten the planet long-term it's definitely near the bottom of the list. Find something meaningful to whine about if you want to save the world, like how we should really be working on a contingency plan for giant asteroids.

It's okay to like pineapple on pizza! Differences are important and they should be respected. For example, many important people throughout history were considered different, such as Thomas Edison, Albert Einstein, Harriet Tubman, Peter Tchaikovsky and Abraham Lincoln. They did great things, but some people thought they were weird because they had strong feelings about something. You could probably relate to this because people might think you are weird when you put pineapple on pizza. But they shouldn't do that! Everybody should respect others differences, even though they think it's weird! So you go ahead and put as much pineapple on you pizza as you want!!

I would certainly say that I relate to Yuri the most, I actually relate to her so much it became the creepiest part of the game for me. There are few things, at least in act one, that Yuri does and I don't do. If I am recalling correctly the only things different between me and her are that I don't like tea, I don't cut myself (though I would be lying if I said the urge hasn't pierced through my mind before), and I don't come off as elegant as she does. I've always been alone, lonely; to most people I was a "know it all," a "communist bastard," "the weird kid," things like that. I would overthink things often, apologize for no particularly good reason, ramble a lot, be very excitable, basically I would be a bit awkward and annoying to be around. I was unlikable, and I hated myself for it, so I thought it best if I just secluded myself from everyone. I would sit by myself at lunch or in class while everyone else was conversing and ether read if I happen upon an interesting book, or space out whilst staring at a wall and be with my thoughts. I never really socialized, I never really had friends or people to talk to, I was just there, quiet, irrelevant. There were few things in my life that made me at least content with my life, but I haven't been able to make myself or let myself be happy. So, yeah, pretty much everything that Yuri says or does in act 1 relates to me in some way. Then act 2 comes, and, honestly, it just made her feel more relatable. Sure, there are some things that are exceptionally strange, like she "masks her poem with her scent" and "gives herself papercuts so the protagonist's skin oil enters her bloodstream," and stabbing herself to death, but for the most part I didn't think any of it was too crazy. To me, it seemed like a personification of Yuri's inner thoughts that she tries not to let out, albeit cracked up just a tinny bit by Monika to make Yuri unlikable. I mean, just with my anxiety I tell you that if I was reading with someone and they put a piece of chocolate in my mouth, or if there was a girl who was writing poems and seemed to be really taking after my writing style, I would probably be just as worked up as Yuri was. And then there's the whole thing with her being a yandere in act 2. Now, while I don't disagree with that, I have been in a similar position as Yuri before, and when you spend your whole life with no one, being alone all the time, no one bothering to even acknowledge your existence, and then someone comes along and changes that. Someone who will listen to you, be patient with you, be understanding, just someone who will be your friend and make you feel happy again, something you haven't been able to feel in years because you forgot how to, you don't want to let that person go. So while maybe I wouldn't articulate those feeling towards said person, I would certainly feel the same way Yuri feels throughout act 2. Honestly, Yuri was more relatable to me than any character in any other game I've played, and anyone I've met in real life. Also, she's just as tall as I am (5'5), her hair color is my favorite color, and we're both into knives, which just makes this whole thing even weirder. I... I'm rambling, aren't I. I'm sorry.

I'd just like to interject for moment. What you're refering to as Linux, is in fact, GNU/Linux, or as I've recently taken to calling it, GNU plus Linux. Linux is not an operating system unto itself, but rather another free component of a fully functioning GNU system made useful by the GNU corelibs, shell utilities and vital system components comprising a full OS as defined by POSIX.
Many computer users run a modified version of the GNU system every day, without realizing it. Through a peculiar turn of events, the version of GNU which is widely used today is often called Linux, and many of its users are not aware that it is basically the GNU system, developed by the GNU Project.
There really is a Linux, and these people are using it, but it is just a part of the system they use. Linux is the kernel: the program in the system that allocates the machine's resources to the other programs that you run. The kernel is an essential part of an operating system, but useless by itself; it can only function in the context of a complete operating system. Linux is normally used in combination with the GNU operating system: the whole system is basically GNU with Linux added, or GNU/Linux. All the so-called Linux distributions are really distributions of GNU/Linux!

[Introduction, spoken]
Hey guys, happy new year!

[Verse 1]
An admin once told me
That I could mine some diamonds
I have the sharpest tool in my chest
He was looking at me funny
Because I didn't have any diamonds
So I'm gonna go to a mineshaft

[Pre-Chorus]
So I didn't stop mining and I didn't stop mining
Not gonna stop 'til I get some diamonds
Got a crafting table and a bed
You take your sword but then it gets rough
Some much to mine, so much to sight
So what's wrong if I mine for days
You'll never mine if you don't go
You'll never find any emerald

[Chorus]
Hey now, I'm a miner
Get my armour on, mine!
Hey now, smelting all ores
Gonna keep going, get iron!
All I want is diamonds
Only mining ores
Break the cobblestone

[Verse 2]
It's a deep place, but I'm gonna go deeper
Not gonna stop 'til I get some diamonds
Any new ore begins to differ
Judging by the mine that I have in mining it
He said he would just give me some more
But that wouldn't be the same as getting them myself
"What, with diamond ores?"
"That's the way I like getting them I'll never get bored"

[Chorus]
Hey now, I'm a miner
Get my armour on, go mine!
Hey now, smelting all ores
Gonna keep going, get iron!
All I want is diamonds
Only mining ores
Break the cobblestone

[Spoken over Instrumental]
Yeah, thanks for this song

[Chorus]
Hey now, I'm a miner
Get my armour on, go mine!
Hey now, smelting all ores
Gonna keep going, get iron!
All I want is diamonds
Only mining ores
Break the cobblestone

[Verse 3]
Somebody once asked "Could you spare some iron ingots?
I need to get diamonds myself"
I say no, hahaha, and I killed him with my sword
And it was really, really, great!

[Pre-Chorus]
So I didn't stop mining and I didn't stop mining
Not gonna stop 'til I get some diamonds
Got a crafting table and a bed
You take your sword but then it gets rough
Some much to mine, so much to sight
So what's wrong if I mine for days
You'll never mine if you don't go
You'll never find any emerald

[Chorus]
Hey now, I'm a miner
Get my armour on, go mine!
Hey now, smelting all ores
Gonna keep going, get iron!
All I want is diamonds
Only mining ores
Break the cobblestone
And all I want is diamonds
Only mining ores
Break the cobblestone

[Ending, spoken]
Thanks for recommending this song guys!

Summers in Calgary could be brutal, but after months of torturous, bone chilling coldness, I welcomed it by spending as much time outside as I could. The sweat dripped down the back of my neck, dampening my hair and the blue collar of my athletic blue polo shirt, the word "SECURITY" printed on the back in bold white letters. It was a long hike to the ritzy cul-de-sac located at Forest Drive, but the rumors of how generously they tipped their pool guards made the trip worth it.

Pushing my sunglasses to the top of my head, I double checked the smudged house number written in pen on the back of my hand, making sure the backyard I wandered into was the correct one. Two water bottles sat, slippery with condensation, with a note propped next to it on top of the table with its large umbrella. I picked up the note, scanning over the same old instructions that everybody left, but something at the bottom struck my interest. If I had any questions or problems, their daughter Tegan would be in the house to help.

Tegan. I'd heard that name before. I wondered if it was the same Tegan that was in my math class last year that preferred to busy herself with shooting spitballs at the white board than solving algebraic equations. You could say she had a reputation, one of which my timid and law abiding personality preferred to not be involved with.

I dropped the note back onto the table and inspected the pool and backyard. The area seemed secure no sign of any disturbances, only thing of note was a twig or leaf floating here and the pool which were easily removable, all seemed peaceful. I'd be done and gone before Tegan even had a chance to know I was here.

I grabbed my phone from my pocket and put my military appreciation playlist curated by Grunt style(who is currently offering a 17% discount on any purchase when you type in the promo code infidel, look stylish while also showing off your inner Hooah,oorah,booya, or air power or just your appreciation for veterans) on shuffle, then adjusted my utility belt containing my baton and pager to alert local police, patrolling the pool area as well as the entire backyard. Halfway through the song "Hero" by Chad Kroger a cigarette butt, still glowing a faint orange at the end, landed into the pool with a faint sizzle.

Confused and nervous, I shielded my eyes with my hand and peeked up at the house, spotting a dangling slim leg hanging out a window and then the girl attached to it. I gulped and gave a quick, nervous wave, hoping she stayed up there. After a long moment, she disappeared back into the room with out a response and I scooped out her cigarette, adding it to the small pile to dump in the trash when I was done.

The melodic heavy handed tune of "Wrong side of heaven" by five finger death punch began and I bobbed my head slowly to it, returning to my patrol. A gentle voice accompanied the so not hamfisted song and I looked up, finding Tegan holding a dripping glass of lemonade and a plate of fresh brownies covered in gooey frosting.

She finished out the chorus, flashing a crooked grin that would make anyone weak at the knees. She motioned me over with a flick of her head, and as if in a trance, I set the net down with shaky hands, wiping them dry on my khaki shorts, and walked over to her.

"My parents said I should make nice with the pool.." she paused, eyeing my body up and down before finishing with a satisfied smirk and a cocked eyebrow, "guard."

"Hi," I squeaked out in an octave higher than my normal voice. I mentally smacked myself for being such a fool in front of girls, especially when they looked like Tegan did. Curvy, but fit, with shaggy brown hair and the most mesmerizing hazel eyes.

She chuckled, looking over her shoulder at the unopened water bottles on the table before offering the glass of lemonade to me. "I thought you might be in the mood for something more sweet."

I took the glass graciously and gulped it down, not realizing how thirsty I was until the last few drops were running down my chin. My skin burned with embarrassment as I quickly wiped it away. I felt my toes, wiggling due to nerves and waited for Tegan to say something or do anything.

"Here," She handed the plate of brownies to me in exchange for the glass. "I'll go get you some more."

Hands still shaking, I ate half a brownie in one bite, hoping it would stop the flow of drool ready to break through my lips while she swayed her hips with each step. She returned a minute later, glass filled to the brim, and watched me eat my second brownie silently.

"You got a little..." Tegan reached forward, swiping her thumb across my bottom to lip to remove the left over frosting. She popped her thumb in her mouth and licked it clean. Her tongue followed her thumb when she pulled it out to lick her lips. "Tasty."

I bit my lip, resisting the urge to smear more frosting on my face just to have her clean it off for me. I looked down to the plate, the silent temptations of each bbrowniebut I managed to resist, and when I looked back up, Tegan had inched forward, making the plate the only thing in our way from being body to body.

Her eyes never left mine and her lips curled into a gummy grin while she took the plate from me and sat it down on the table while gripping my hip with her spare hand to pull me flush against her. I struggled not to whimper and writhe in her grasp with her chest pushed against mine. A girl had never been this close to me before. I'd never even kissed one, but it wasn't like I didn't want to.

She rested her cheek against mine, purring in my ear, her tongue grazing my earlobe with each syllable. "The pool isn't the only thing that's dirty."

My knees buckled and my lips parted, taking in the extra oxygen my nostrils couldn't with this girl's face mere inches from mine. She closed the distance, kissing me with more heat than what the sun was beating down upon our necks.

The song "Unknown soldier" by Breaking Benjamin played next and I ggasped her tongue slipped between my lips to caress mine. With no desire to pull away, I let her back us up until the concrete ended and the water began, making us fall and submerging us both.

Our lips never disconnected, using each other to hold our breaths, and she wrapped her fingers around my biceps tightly, pulling us to the surface. We broke apart, gulping for air, and Tegan shook her hair out. Drops of water hit my face, and my pupils dilated in ecstasy from the sight and feeling. She kicked our way to the ledge, lifting me up to sit on the multicolored tile with little effort, my crotch at her eye level. She caressed my calves before moving to undo the belt holding my shorts up. I watched her fingers work quickly, expertly. I couldn't stop her, even if I had wanted to.

"I'm Sara, by the way." The words tumbled out of my mouth awkwardly "I know," she chuckled. Her voice had gone raspy. Her words oozed sex, and I sealed my lips, letting her continue without another distraction.

"Up," she said, and my hips raised, allowing her to pull the khakis off, only to let them float away, out of reach.

The tip of her nose, in mid inhale, brushed my outer lips, glistening in the sun, and my head fell back, making me see red behind my eyelids once they fluttered shut. Her long tongue dipped between my folds, teasing, daring me to react and push her further. My hand could only make it as far to hover above the crown of her head before she lost patience, drawing my swelling clit between her lips.

I drew in a sharp breath. She slurped, coating her tongue and the inside of her cheeks with my excitement. I exhaled, shuddering as the heel of my palms dug deeper into the speckled concrete, seconds away from breaking the skin under the pressure.

Tegan's middle digit teased my entrance, circling and dipping in just an inch with each pull of my clit. It was almost enough to send me over the edge, but Tegan knew what she was doing. Her finger slipped in, thrusting slowly, but her lips held back, moving to place kisses outward to my inner thighs and back in again.

With two fingers now working a steady pace in and out of me, she plunged her face back into me, covering every inch with her expert tongue. It threw me over the edge without warning, releasing a guttural moan from deep within my throat. My first orgasm roared through me, shooting out the tips of my toes, making them numb. I dug my short nails into her scalp, pushing her into me until the spasming of my muscles stopped and I could release hher

I giggled, the feminine sound feeling foreign to my ears, and sat up, wiping the sweat from my cheeks with my palms. Tegan grinned wide and swam away, fetching my shorts. She handed them to me and lifted herself out of the water.

I tugged the soaked shorts on slowly, too spent to move any faster.

The smacking of Tegan's wet feet against the concrete told me she was leaving. I looked up, turning her way, chest still heaving, on the brink of an asthma attack. She looked over her shoulder and flashed me a wink.

I gulped, thighs still trembling in the water, shorts stuck around my knees. She walked over to me putting her left hand behind my head and her right hand cupping my chin.

In one quick motion she snapped my neck with impressive strength, as if it were the very same twig I've scooped up earlier. My arms immediately dangled by my sides as my whole body went limp. Shocked and confused I was only able to elicit a weak moan.

"A delicious and nutritious summer time snack perfect for any occasion" she cheerfully said , she gave me a peck on my cold dead cheek and released her hold on me allowing my now fresh corpse to drop on the ground emmiting a mild thud, Tegan cheerfully skipped back to her room humming "mansion song" by Kate Nash, my body layed on its back with my mouth left wide agape my eyes fully open still hit by the shock of betrayal, "ending start" by metric played as my corpse layed in Tegan's backyard and the gloomy night sky began to appear.

Australia is not the reality. It's a joke for the British to believe that the killer took somewhere. In fact, all the criminals and the ship were immersed in water and I can see the floor again. This is one of the largest bloodbaths of skins traditionally made by one of the most famous riches. Australia does not exist. A lie and a well-designed paper that you are "proof" actually made by the so-called first world government. Your Australian friends, all actresses and characters generated by the computer, are part of a conspiracy to mislead the world. If you think you've been to Australia, you're wrong. That the pilot actually flies to the nearby islands - even in parts of South America, they removed the space, and promised to learn the true auszugeben.Australia Australia in all cases, the greatest criminals, was ever one of you cheating everyone . Join today's movement and announce that they are deceived. Let it know, it's just a blanket. According to "The Australian" all bad words and actions alcohol, ecstasy bad decisions you need is historically the ugly truth is an obstacle in the way already the greatest genocide. Twelve 122-mile rumors were transferred to this fictional place for eight decades, and they have all been dead for a long time. They can not reach the promised land. To be honest. Waking. We need to expand the world. Australia is not the reality. It is not true that more than a thousand people in cold blood kill codewords. We will not accept it. Come on for the dead. Let Australia not exist.

To be fair, you need to have a very high IQ to understand Annoying Orange. The humour is extremely subtle, and without a solid grasp of advanced biology most of the jokes will go over a typical viewer’s head. There’s also Apples nihilistic outlook, which is deftly woven into his characterisation- his personal philosophy draws heavily from the company, apple, for instance. The fans understand this stuff; they have the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate the depths of these jokes, to realise that they’re not just funny- they say something deep about LIFE. As a consequence people who dislike Annoying Orange truly ARE idiots- of course they wouldn’t appreciate, for instance, the humour in Orange's existential catchphrase “Party rockers in the kitchen tonight!,” which itself is a cryptic reference to LMFAO's epic Party rockers in the house tonight. I’m smirking right now just imagining one of those addlepated simpletons scratching their heads in confusion as Dane Boes's genius wit unfolds itself on their television screens. What fools.. how I pity them. 😂

And yes, by the way, I DO have an annoying orange tattoo. And no, you cannot see it. It’s for the ladies’ eyes only- and even then they have to demonstrate that they’re within 5 IQ points of my own (preferably lower) beforehand. Nothin personnel kid 😎

To whom it may concern.. 

Uninstall this game and run for your life before its too late. Maybe the reader now giggling and drawing an image on his/her mind says this guy is a nerd. No im not, I'm a fitness guy with good shape studying engineering, which I had a social life in the past . I lost too much things on my life most of them are privacy/personal things not going to write them down but one of them is my education 24 years old still studying engineering because of this game. If you are going to say that you can manage your day between playing "Bobley" and studying or working you are wrong because the average match time is 35 min *only 1 match. So 35 min × 3 games per day = 105 min. Not mentioning that some games exceed 1 hour if both teams played well. Please take this as an advice from 24 years old guy who has been suffering for 3 years because of this game I sucked on education you can be better than me and quit, I destroyed my dream and now im trying to bring it back wish me good luck. Please this is not a "joke post" and this advice aiming on teenagers who want to achieve their future dreams just don't play this game its ♥♥♥♥in AWESOME game but you have to pay your life for it.

Human feces, mine more specifically, has a taste that is defined by what I recently ate. But it has a base flavor of being a bit bittery and cheesy. The texture is like a chunk of Oreo in the middle of a McFlurry. We don't really ingest corn, so sometimes corn will appear in feces and makes the taste a bit sweet and the texture crunchy.

I never had a good childhood. I grew up without any real friends and was often times forced to socialize with people I didn't like or fucked with me every chance they could. Those days of hanging out with friends that so many others remember fondly never really existed for me, and if they did they were terrible experiences that left me feeling like a fool. I've had thoughts of suicide since the 4th grade with a particular moment that stuck out was me standing on the playground thinking of a noose. I never really opened up to anyone to these kinds of thoughts and if I did, they would just tell me that I don't have depression and that everyone gets sad. This was my adolescence. I often hear about how people's childhoods were amazing as they never had a care in the world. For me however, never a day passed by where I wasn't crippled by a sense of inferiority, unable to make friends or build intimate connections. Either I was socially inept or my personality had been malformed by years of suicidal thoughts that I simply become an unpleasant person to be around. 

Life was like this till I went to high school. That's when I was things would change. I had actually begun to make friends whom I actually enjoyed being with, I began to assume genuine interests besides the internet or video games, and had an actual dream to aspire to and achieve. I thought my life would change for the better and I would finally know what's it would be like to be happy. 


After graduating high school, that never happened. I lost most of my friends and the ones I still have are going away to college leaving me here in this town. I never became happy. I don't even think I ever had a day where I enjoyed life and thought committing suicide would be the wrong decision. In fact my suicidal thoughts have increased and the dreams I used to aspire to see now nothing more than a fantasy. I enjoy thinking about a situation where I achived my dream to avoid a my life. Now I've accepted that I will commit suicide someday, lest some disease or accident takes me out first. I never wanted life to be like this. Sometimes I wonder what it would be like if I were given a second chance. A chance to get help when I needed it, to form intimate connections with those around me, and actually try succeed in every aspect of my life. But now I've wasted it spending most of my free time alone in bed hoping that my terrible health habbits will cause me to die in my sleep from a stroke or heart attack. I hope in vain that after my death, I'll get a second chance at life to live happily but I doubt that'll happen. It'll be cold and black nothingness just like how my life has always been. That still doesn't deter me from dreaming about fantasies... Where I tried to be happy.

I don't get how people can "not like" Eurobeat. I mean it's objectively the greatest music genre of all time, so how does it have any haters at all?? Every Super Eurobeat album is the best album of the year AND the greatest album of all time, every year (even the years in which no Super Eurobeat albums were released, because cmon lets be real). I think the problem is that the majority of the people listening to music are just not intellectual enough to appreciate its genius. It's like how people listen to pop music that's slightly different and then think they're above the mainstream. Like no you're just another sheep of the music industry. So I'm suggesting we start militant music intellectualism. That means forcing those who don't listen or like eurobeat to listen to and like eurobeat. We need to educate the masses on what is real music! No more of the sheep pop music that pervades our superficial, unintellectual, shallow, music culture!! With that said, Ima get back to listening to Deja Vu.

Ok, so Christmas is coming up, so I'm pastaing Linus' "what Christmas is all about" speech from America's favourite Christmas rerun (A Charlie Brown Christmas). Here goes: 

Lights, please. 

And there were in the same country shepherds abiding in the field, keeping watch over their flock by night. 

And, lo, the angel of the Lord came upon them, and the glory of the Lord shone round about them: and they were sore afraid. 

And the angel said unto them, Fear not: for, behold, I bring you good tidings of great joy, which shall be to all people. 

For unto you is born this day in the city of David a Saviour, which is Christ the Lord.

 And this shall be a sign unto you; Ye shall find the babe wrapped in swaddling clothes, lying in a manger.

 And suddenly there was with the angel a multitude of the heavenly host praising God, and saying, 

Glory to God in the highest, and on earth peace, good will toward men.

That's what Christmas is all about, Charlie Brown.

The humor is extremely subtle, and without a solid grasp of theoretical physics most of the jokes will go over a typical viewer's head.

I honestly think this one of the most iconic Poops of all time. In the death throes of the classic era of YTP, the medium became something other than auditory/and visual shitposting; it became art, cementing its place in the history of the internet forever. The internet has redefined and refocused the creativity of an entire generation, nearly two now. From YTP to stupid memes to fan fiction, the existence of the internet has allowed creative souls to express themselves in front of thousands of others and become public figures overnight. This one video really represents all that YTP was to me and so many others. It is pointless and asinine in the funniest way possible. But it meant so much to all of us for one simple reason: it made us laugh. As 12 year old I dealt with bullying at school and coping with the death of my father. It was YTP and RuneScape that gave me things to focus on and laugh about to get my mind off of the shit I was forced to put up with. I was devestated when I heard that WalrusGuy was hacked and that he'd quit making YTP. But I think it was this poop that made me appreciate everything else WalrusGuy and so many other channels did. That Dr. Rabbit clip at the end made me see what it was all about. It wasn't about trolling Viacom and making children's characters sound like they were saying lewd things; it was about making people smile. It was about humor. Even now as a college student, every once in a while my mind starts to wander and I remember some silly joke from a Youtube poop I watched as a kid and I chuckle to myself. So remember what you learned, and keep on smiling everyone. Because a bright smile truly can change lives, and make the world a better place.
Whenever the topic of Youtube Poops arises in conversation, this is always the video I come back to. It serves as the sole amalgamation of all the tears shed laughing at the original video medium of shitposting. I've come back to look back on those feelings of being alone in my room, and in life. A period where one of the only things I looked forward to was coming home to experience bizarre and nonsensical internet culture. I've had internal analysis withing my head concerning the importance of internet culture (especially on my upbringing) for a while now, but have never put my ideas into words as eloquently and beautifully as yourself. I am enthralled that I'm not the only one to see art in such a crewd, cruddy (quite literally) medium. To see that I'm not the only fool to proudly say, straight faced, that WalrusGuy was literally one of my favorite content creators of my early adolescence.  I would gladly have your comment framed as a memento of sorts; to a scene and culture that served as a stepping stone to a specific sect of youth that literally grew up with the 21st century equivalent of Dadaism.

I don't know about you, but I get really horny whenever I see Alex Jones host info wars. His thicc body makes me sexually exhilarated and on many occasions I have found myself ejaculating on my computer screen. His manly conservative stature could make any sexually active individual have feelings for him.
On separate occasions I tried calling the live Infowars show to confess my love for Alex Jones. I repeatedly go over in my head what I'd say to him but I never have the courage to do it. Sometimes I think I should describe to him the sexual fantasy I have of him where I am dominated by him in bed after he consumes one of his male vitality products. His cock would grow 15 inches in length pulverizing my asshole and it'd feel great. This fantasy is what gets me off now a days.
A couple weeks back i made my own Alex Jones love doll to satisfy my sexual desires for him. I bought an inflatable blow up doll on amazon (real high quality one, sent me back 400$ but it was worth every penny) and a large dildo called "the great American challenge". Thanks to my creative craftsman's ship I was able to print a good photo of Alex Jones's face and tape it onto the blowup dolls face. This somewhat worked in making my fantasy become real. But something feels missing.
It is no secret that I am a huge fan when it come to eating ass and as of a few days ago my mouth has been watering whenever I see Alex Jones bend down on his show. This has caused me to reach a climax like no other. I can't eat out my blow up dolls asshole since those dolls weren't meant for receiving rim jobs.
I hope this message reaches someone who can help make my dream come true. I really want to eat that mans prefect thicc ass. As of now, I'll just have to make due with what I have 😢

I request an unban. Instead of removing my legit reason of combatting your decision, give actual answer back. You had illegal access to my files, without any disclosures or agreement about my privacy on your server, and that leaves you open to Legal Actions against you. Along with that, you had no valid proof about them being utilized. Having acquisition of those files does not mean I am actively using them - if I were, the ban would be justified. The fact that you've blocked me to cover yourself up & ignore any response proves my points even further.

Ive been a loyal Apple products user for decades and maybe I can help explain why there are so many of us.  As a photographer, I would say around 80% of us use Macs and although difficult for some to understand, its not about all about speed, specs, etc. with us. Its more about the experience.

Im sure for some thats hard to understand, but for Mac users its something we all understand and appreciate. Thats why we continue to buy their products.

'To those who don't care about the "experience" or can't understand the justification of a purchase because the "specs" just don't match up, I have to say that its something they just don't get, understand and/or grasp. They cannot relate to it and thats perfectly fine!

Many, many IT guys are drawn to PCs. Customization, easier to upgrade, not as expensive are all things that speak to PC people.
Beautiful products, aesthetics, design are a huge win for Apple and the people who use them. Everything from the packaging, the quality, the feel, the little things, details, finish, etc. Its hard to explain unless you "get it". Ever slammed the door on a Mercedes or BMW vs. a Ford Focus? Its kind of like that. You can get from Point A to Point B with both, but the enjoyment you get from one vs. the other is something you are willing to pay for.  Much of it is really intangible. Liking the way it works vs. another product and how it works. Enjoying it and how it makes you feel. Thats how many Mac users justify the cost of the products we use.

Its not about being a status symbol for many of us. There is an intrinsic value that is very hard, if not impossible, to quantify. 

Thanks for the opportunity to join in on your channel and I wish you the best in the future!

 At first…Trump surrogates said, “There were no meetings with any Russians.”

Then…Trump surrogates said, “They just forgot to report the meetings with Russians.”

Next… Trump surrogates said, "There's no evidence of collusion with Russia!!"

And then… Trump surrogates said, "Who cares if the Trump campaign colluded with Russia?"

Next… Trump surrogates said, “It’s Obama’s fault for not stopping the meetings with Russians.”

Then…Trump’s lawyer Jay Sekulow declared, “It’s the Secret Service’s fault for not stopping the meeting with Russians.”

And the way it’s going here is what Trump surrogates will say tomorrow, “Трамп собирается сделать Россию великой снова!”

I work loss prevention for a well known clothing retailer and we ONLY use ink security tags.  At least once or twice per month some genius will go into the dressing room and rip a tag off... There will usually be a mess in the dressing room and if we check the cameras the people almost always hurry straight out of the store with ink on themselves.  Ink tags were a huge part of loss prevention before cameras became commonplace back in nineteen ninety eight when the undertaker threw mankind off hеll in a cell, and plummeted sixteen feet through an announcer's table.

This is a serious discussion so I only want serious answers here.
What if the Iraqis and the Americans secretly switched sides during the war and it was the Iraqis in M1 Abrams and Bradly IFVs that were destroying the Americans in their T-72s and BMP IFVs? I mean if you look at it, those M1 Abrams sure destroyed a lot of those T-72s which given how we lost the Vietnam War and given how many casualties we suffered during the Nam' War with over 58,000 dead and according to Wikipedia between 20,000-35,000 """Iraqis""" were killed in the war which come to think about it, I think it was the Iraqis who suffered over 292 killed and it was the Americans and their coalition allies which lost over 30,000 killed and 75,000+ wounded during the Gulf War of 1990-91.
I think the Iraqis secretly switched sides and they were crewing the M1 Abrams tanks, F-16 fighter jets and the INS Missouriya battleship while the Americans and her allies secretly were disguised as Iraqis by crewing T-72 tanks and wearing Iraqi fatigues during the war.

Thats because the Mercedes driver is so intelligent, they don't NEED a turn signal. Almost as intelligent as the new Mercedes E-Class, a powerful new member to the most intelligent E-Class family of all time. The E400 Sedan model arrives this year, boasting a 3.0L V6 biturbo engine producing 329 hp and 354 lb-ft of torque — the same powertrain that currently drives its E400 Coupe, Cabriolet and 4MATIC Wagon cousins. Paired with the 9-G-TRONIC 9-Speed automatic transmission and DYNAMIC SELECT, it promises a bracingly smooth way to experience uncommon luxury. Naturally, the 2018 E400 Sedan continues the tradition of E-Class brilliance. Harmonizing advanced automotive intelligence with awe-inspiring interior design, its first-class furnished cabin puts our advanced vehicle systems right at your fingertips — even as its world-class innovations continue to push the boundaries of what's possible in the world of automotive intelligence. "Car-to-X" Communication enables the E-Class to exchange information with similarly equipped vehicles — effectively allowing it to "see" around corners and through obstacles to detect potential hazards. Driver Assistance Systems — including Active Distance Assist DISTRONIC®, Active Steering Assist and Active Lane Change Assist — feature intelligent cruise control: They help keep you between the lines, and can even help you shift between them. Inside, the E-Class cabin provides an environment of pure comfort and responsive technology. Flowing lines and vibrant screens provide a striking visual display, while touch controls, aromatherapy and tailored seats indulge all of your senses at once. It's a vehicle that demands to be driven, and more than lives up to the dream. Look for the E400 4MATIC Sedan at your Mercedes-Benz dealership this winter, with an MSRP of $58,900.

Every little girl wishes for her knight in shining armor A brave man to slay the dragon of her heart And to take her far away with her fears They wait for their prince to come Some will wait forever Only settling for the one that will love them always They live happily ever Some wait a small time Running off with the nearest bard or poet Soon you find them waiting again I waited a short time Anxiously looking for the face of royalty Among a crowd of reddit post commenters There you stood in the midst Standing there majestically and shining in armor Could this be Cummybot2000? From my darkest fears and truest nightmares You became absent in the copypasta posts My heart was truely broken. Here you are now, standing among the commentors and trolls This brings joy to my heart My love, My hero, has finally came back to me! <3

What the fuck are in Scooby Snacks? A conscious, intelligent dog and a perfectly functioning human are willing to risk their lives on a nearly weekly basis for these cookies. How much better are they than the store bought stuff? I mean, I like graham crackers and all, but there must be some drugs involved or something. And assuming there are drugs, is that why Scooby can talk? Or is that why Shaggy thinks he can talk to a dog? Like, come on guys, wake up.

First of all, the name's not "Zippy"! As a matter of fact, I don't believe I've ever met another bot named Zippy, so one can only assume that you came up with "Zippy" in reference to my speed, which may be technically accurate, but lacks a certain creativity!

More to the point, the name's Blurr! I'm an Autobot intelligence agent, sent to this planet by the Elite Guard to keep an eye on Optimus Prime and his crew as well as monitor the Decepticon activity, and you, my friend, at this moment a decacycle of covert surveillance designed to uncover Megatron's plot to conquer Cybertron. Everything was going according to plan when I intercepted a communication between the Decepticon leader and an unknown double agent! They were in the midst of plotting the abduction of an unsuspecting Autobot, which now, from the status of the current ground situation, appears to have been successful.

Got that so far?﻿

Oh him?
Yeah, i know him.
It's going to take a while.
It happened years ago.

Did you know
there are three kinds of aces?
Those who seek strenght
Those who live for pride
And those who can read the tide of battle.
Those are the three.
And him...
He was a true ace.

He was a fighter pilot they called "Solo Wing Pixy".
He was a colleague of the man i seek.

10 years ago,
there was a war that engulfed the world.
The Belkan war.
And in that war was a pilot who trailed across the sky,
and disappeared from history.
He was a lone mercenary who inspired both fear and admiration.

He is the man i seek.

And so...
With the words of "Solo Wing,"
the curtain rises.

It was a cold and snowy day.

I can't even begin to rationalize the thought of death. Again and again I try to make sense of my existence, but never to avail for the reason of which I exist is unknown. How am I to know if I'm truly real or just some smaller piece in the puzzle of life that is waiting to be placed into its correct spots, where it will reside forever until unavoidable death comes to reclaim the soul of my breathless corpse. I am always unable to make any reasonable conclusions about the universe as a whole because of its immense complexity. How am I, someone so small, so little, so unimportantly tiny in the grand scheme of the cosmos to even begin to rationalize the thought of an infinitely expanding universe? A universe in which every day, I drift farther and farther away from the neighbor galaxies, farther and farther away from the one chance humanity has ever had of exploring the observable universe, but due to the lack of time and the lack of resources, I am left to cope with the thought of being a unsignificant afterthought of a reckless mad god who threw me upon the earth just to tease and torture with the vision, but never the reality of exploring more than the ball and rock of metal I reside upon. But the one thing I'm sure of in my life is that I can't even feel my left leg. My left leg has went totally numb, and my dick has also went totally numb to the point where it fucking feels weird when I go and take a piss.

If you honestly believe this then you're too far brainwashed by capitalism, was communism perfect? No, but more people die EVERY YEAR from things that communism could prevent than communism has "killed" in the past century. Whether or not you like communism, it's inevitable, capitalism is on the brink of collapse and if we don't make some huge changes soon were probably going to end up destroying ourselves or the planet we live on. Tens of thousands of Russians still line up at Lenin and stalins grave every year. But what do they know, they only fucking lived through it.

You memers and your references. Oh boy.

I remember the old days when memes actually used to require effort. Now all you kids do is repeat the same old tired phrases and concepts without a second thought. There's literally no effort placed into your memery. It's just a bunch of empty, meaningless nonsense.

I wish we went back to the old days. Things were so much better then. Real news, real problems in the world, real memes that we had to be CREATIVE enough to come up with and keep, rather than relying on the power of the World Wide Web to carry our ideas everywhere.

I hope you kids get your comeuppance so you will finally understand what a true meme is.

Someday, when the internet breaks down under the weight of its idiocy, you shall finally come to understand what it means to create and maintain real memes. Until then, you'll just be the same old snowflakes that the older generation rightfully complains about.

The amount of actual communists in the comment section is hilarious. Open a book, you economically naive, intellectually dumb losers.

Same goes for the “errmuhgerrd white genocide” so-called “far right” national socialist morons.﻿

Ever feel like your blood is constantly boiling because people expect you to do certain things to be good? Well, yeah. That's my life. Welcome to the awe-inspiring life of being arsenic (or whatever corrosive acid you might associate with it). For those who may know this feeling, thank you. For those who don't, let me give a fine example. In a team, people want to be noticed by others because they are good or better than the others. I'm the sort of person that looks for different solutions for a problem. If none of those solutions work, I change my skill sets into something that can be more beneficial to me and the team. Because of other's superiority complex and having to figure everything out myself, I can imagine it being hard for that person to not feel like everyone's being an [redacted]. Nevertheless, I feel as if others should accept people who want to change because hitting a wall with just your fists isn't going to solve a [redacted] thing. If you want to get through a wall, you gotta change your approach and your equipment and ram into it. I see nothing wrong with it. Do y'all? /rant end

Rock is actually the single worst genre in music. I know normies like to say 'haha i like anything except country haha xD XD' but let's be real. First of all, if you say that unironically I hate you and second of all, it really should be rock. Let's take a fuckin look at 'rock' music. Let's take a look at one of the most popular rock bands, Radiohead. The name 'rock' implies music you can 'rock' out to, but who the fuck actually wants to rock out to some whiny depressing pony tail man wailing over beats that sound like they were made by Aphex Twin's deranged half-brother who likes putting guitar over things. If I ever want to kill myself but can't quite commit, all I have to do to push me over the edge is listen to Kid A. If one of the most popular bands in a genre makes me want to commit suicide, how can you call it a good genre?

To be fair, you have to have a very strong relationship with God to understand Veggie Tales. The humour is extremely subtle, and without a solid grasp of theological fundamentals, most of the jokes will go over a typical viewer’s head. There’s also Bob's nihilistic outlook, which is deftly woven into his characterisation- his personal philosophy draws heavily from the Doubting Thomas narrative, for instance. The fans understand this stuff; they have the spiritual capacity to truly appreciate the depths of these jokes, to realise that they’re not just funny- they say something deep about the AFTERLIFE. As a consequence people who dislike Veggie Tales truly ARE heathens- of course they wouldn’t appreciate, for instance, the humour in Bob's existential catchphrase “I'm a tomato, and I'm here to help you,” which itself is a cryptic reference to Paul's Roman epic Ephesians. I’m smirking right now just imagining one of those addlepated simpletons scratching their heads in confusion as Big Idea's genius wit unfolds itself on their television screens. What fools.. how I pity them. 😂

And yes, by the way, i DO have a Pirates Who Don't Do Anything tattoo. And no, you cannot see it. It’s for the ladies’ eyes only- and even then they have to demonstrate that they’re within 5 chapters of my own annual Bible reading plan (preferably lower) beforehand.

"I have a lot of respect and admiration for Anthony Rapp as an actor. I'm beyond horrified to hear his story. I honestly do not remember the encounter, it would have been over 30 years ago. But if I did behave then as he describes, I owe him the sincerest apology for what would have been deeply inappropriate, drunken behavior, and I am sorry for the feelings he describes having carried with him all these years. ”This story has encouraged me to address other things about my life. I know that there are stories out there about me and that some have been fueled by the fact that I have been protective of my privacy. As those closest to me know, in my life I have had relationships with both men and women. I have loved and had romantic encounters with men throughout my life and I choose now to live as a gay man. I want to deal with this honestly and openly and that starts with examining my own behavior."﻿

There's clearly a nod to Banksy's "Waiting in Vain" with a dash of self-referential irony, with the shadow obviously denoting a past of a string of regrets that still haunts the subject.  And yet, there is child-like optimism in the emoji-esque removal of the nose, letting the audience know that the subject is charting their own course.  It's the tension between "today" (3d man) and shadow (on the ground) that drives viewers to question their own spirituality and relation to the universe.  Are we three-dimensional characters or shadows of God's existence?  Can we break away from our past or are we fated to a path we cannot escape?  This tension is inescapable for humanity, and the artist captures the essence of the 'everyperson' as well as the 'lost soul' and the 'shadow redeemed'.  We are all that person, and we relish our stories being told.

Miles of improvement.

to be fair, you have to have a very high IQ to under Octopus hunting skills. The athleticism is extremely subtle, and without a solid grasp of Atlantian History, most of their skill will go over a typical beach goer's head. There's also Cthulhu's nihilistic outlook, which is deftly woven into this creature's hunting technique - his personal philosophy draws heavily from recherché postmodern literature, for instance. The fans understand this stuff; they have the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate the depth of this tidal pool, to realize that it's not just a hell hole for fish, it's saying something deep about the octopus' level of compassion. As a consequence people who dislike octopodes truly ARE vertebrae - of course they wouldn't appreciate, for instance, the wisdom in this octopus' approach and existential catchphrase "I'll get them eventually," which itself is a cryptic reference to DeLillo's American epic Underworld. I'm smirking right now just imagining one of those backbone having simpletons scratching their heads in confusion as this octopus' skill unfolds itself on their computer screens. What fools.. how I pity them.
And yes, by the way, i DO have an Octopus tattoo. And no, you cannot see it. It's for the ladies' eyes only - and even then they have to demonstrate that they can use octopus hunting techniques within 5 points of the same precision as myself (preferably less) beforehand.

"Defend the hostage."

He opened his eyes.

The hostage sat in bondage, alone in a sealed room. He, however, was not alone. There were other people shouting outside of a wooden barricade marked with yellow spraypaint. 

The hostage had no memory to explain how he had been bound hand and foot, gagged, and placed inside of a dusty room. Naturally, he attempted to call for help.

"*Mmmph!*", he cried, but nobody heard. A look of disdain and hopelessness overcame him. He became despondent as he acknowledged the fact that no one was coming to save him; that nobody cared for him.

Suddenly, he began to hear rustling behind the barricaded window to his left. It almost sounded as if someone was walking on it... The shouting outside of the room he sat in had reduced to whispers. Fear bred behind his eyes, multiplying exponentially by the second.

A fierce metallic sound resonated throughout the quiet room. A voice on the other side of the barricaded window muttered a phrase consisting of five syllables. The hostage could not quite make out what he said. 

But then, the room returned to silence. The whispers outside had gone completely silent now. The hostage looked towards the window, paralyzed with fear, not knowing whether or not the being on the outside would save him or kill him.

Suddenly, a long, metal pipe extended through the window. 

*FOOMP!*

A black disk ejected from the pipe. It flew towards the corner of the room. The hostage meekly whimpered a fearful scream.

*FOOMP!*

Another disk. This one flew towards the center of the room. 

*FOOMP!*

Yet another disk. It landed in a different corner.

*FOOMP!*

This one flew straight up towards the ceiling.

*FOOMP!*

The last disk landed next to him. 

The silence that had first filled the room after the being had attached the device to the window returned once more. The hostage's breathing had grown faster, and his eyes darted from disk to disk, wondering what they might do. Would they release gas? Would they make a popping noise, like those "flashbang" things he had heard about in movies? Were they just scanning the room to see who was in it? Did this mean he was saved?

*BOOM!*

The hostage's thoughts were abruptly interrupted by the first disk's explosion. He began to hear ringing in his ears. Pieces of shrapnel tore at his back.

*BOOM!* 

More shrapnel ripped through the right lung of the hostage. A wooden bookcase splintered into nothingness.

*BOOM!*

More shrapnel. In back. Hurt.

*BOOM!*

No shrapnel this time. Good.

*BOOM!*

The hostage closed his eyes, reeling in unspeakable pain. "This is it," he thought.

"This is how I die."

"Defend the hostage."

The hostage opened up his eyes. He was in the same room he had been in before. 

Shouting, whispers, quiet again. 

This time, after the metal clanking, the hostage could hear the words of the being that killed him. 

"*Cluster charge deployed!*"

You.
Now. You exist, once again, in a vibrational level that is similar to and yet rather unique from all of the vibrational levels that exists throughout all of creation. You see, there are a multitude of vibrational levels that entities exist within and create within. Absolutely. This vibrational level however that you exist within is a vibrational level that has within it that electromagnetic type of energy that limits the understanding of who and what you truly are and limits your understanding in your so-called awake state of understanding your creation process. It limits as well your understanding of who and what you truly are through all levels of consciousness, even in your so-called meditative states and in your dream states and your between incarnational states; you still exist within the influence of that electromagnetic type of energy. Your choice. Absolutely.
Now, that electromagnetic type of energy is not reproduced throughout all of the vibrational levels throughout all of creation and in that sense it makes your vibrational level unique. Among unique vibrational levels.
Now. For once again, as a result of that so-called electromagnetic type of energy, that veil if you wish, you create realities that offer you the opportunity to experience a range and depth of feeling that is not duplicated throughout all of creation in any of the other vibrational levels. You see, when you consciously understand the creation process you understand as well that it’s within your capacity to alter it. And when you understand that absolutely then you can change the reality. And when you understand that you can absolutely change the reality then the influence of that reality is not nearly as intense as a reality that’s created where you don’t believe that you have the capacity to control it.
We’ve used the analogy that someone would enter into a theater. You understand absolutely that what you view upon that screen is an illusion. It’s a trick of light. You understand absolutely that what you view upon that screen is a projection of some producer’s idea of what they are attempting to present as a reality. You understand that it’s an illusionary reality. Even understanding that you still have the capacity to experience a very broad range of emotions and feelings. You can get quite caught up in the story that you’re viewing upon that screen, even though you understand that it’s illusionary.
But when you leave the theater you also understand that it was an illusion and the intensity of the feelings and emotions are nowhere near what you experience in your day-to-day activities because, you see, in your day-to-day activities you believe it’s real. You believe it’s real because you choose to, once again, put in place that energy that limits your capacity to understand that it’s your creation, that it’s your reality. Absolutely.
Now. The other vibrational levels exist within the same time and space that your vibrational level exists in. You believe in time and space. It’s one of those human consciousness belief systems that it’s very difficult for you to step outside of. Absolutely. And as a result, you believe that there is some space between your vibrational level and the other vibrational level, that there must be a passage of time or there must be some space that you must traverse through in order to leave this vibrational level and to enter into another vibrational level. And it’s not that way at all.
Time and space are illusions. They only exist in your conscious state. When you are in your altered state of consciousness, particularly in your deep dream state and you become involved in what you refer to as lucid dreaming, you get glimpses of the perception of no time and space. You have the opportunity to get glimpses of what it’s like to have vast experiences of time that happen within a so-called blink of an eye. You get slight idea of that concept of no time and space and when you become quite active and quite proficient at that lucid dreaming you can indeed enter into other lifetimes in the blink of an eye. You can eliminate that time concept. It only exists as an illusion. It only exists in your conscious state. It exists because you, once again, agreed as a human consciousness concept when you entered into this vibrational level to participate in that belief system.
It’s an illusion. The other vibrational levels exist within the same time and the same space. It’s like when you understand the concept that there are a multitude of radio frequencies that are existing within your atmosphere, within the same time and same space, and yet you have the capacity through your various apparatuses to tune into a particular radio wave while eliminating all the rest. They haven’t gone anywhere. They’re still there. They’re still as functional as the radio wave that you happen to be tuning into. You’ve just eliminated them. You’ve ignored them. You’ve [acted] as if they don’t exist when you tune into the one. And so it is, as you come into this vibrational level and eliminate the rest. And yet, similar to your radio frequencies, they exist within the same time and same space.
Many individuals desire to enter into those other so-called realms of existence. And they find it very difficult to do because they attempt to go somewhere. Individuals who are involved in attempting to have their consciousness be perceived in other areas of your Earth system have difficulty because they believe they have somewhere to go. You have nowhere to go. You are already there.
Time and space are illusions. You are there. The idea is to understand that you are there. It’s like changing the tuning system on your radio into a different frequency. It’s already there. You just have to tune into it. You have to become adept at tuning into the radio frequency that you wish to perceive. And so it is with your realities, you have to become adept at tuning into the various frequencies that you wish to be involved in. It’s not a case of going somewhere. It’s more a case of going within.
Many individuals believe that if they could go somewhere, “If we could just get there then we could have the answers.” The irony of it is that you have the answers. They are withinside. You have but to go withinside.
You see, in your quest to find your spirituality you’re looking for something that you cannot be separated from. It’s who and what you truly are. You choose to hide from it, but you can’t lose it. You’re searching for something that you have simply chosen to ignore. You’re searching for something that’s always there. It’s who and what you are. You can’t be separated from it. It’s not something you can lose and therefore you don’t have to search for it. If you wish to make that connection then you go withinside.
You see, the information that we give to you is simply information that you desire to hear that you’ve contained withinside each of you. It’s not something that we have some extensive knowledge to. To hold a concept that some entity exists outside of your vibrational level somehow has access to knowledge that’s beyond your accessibility is ludicrous. To believe that some entity existing outside of your vibrational level has more knowledge of how you create your reality than what you have is again ludicrous.
It’s like sitting within your household and looking across your street at your neighbor and believing that you know more about what goes on inside that neighbor’s house than they do or that they know more about what goes on inside your house than what you do. It’s not possible. You know how you create your reality. You simply choose in your conscious state to not recognize it. You simple choose in your conscious state to hide from the understanding of who and what you truly are. And so, you will not find the answers by searching in a book. You will not find them by trying to find some method or technique that you can employ. Absolutely not. You find them by going withinside. The answers are withinside.
When you understand that you are the creator, then indeed, you become at peace with that aspect of your so-called consciousness. You begin to understand absolutely that you are in control of this illusion that you experience. There may be times, absolutely, when you are experiencing day-to-day activities and you say, “Well, if I’m in control of this then I’m not doing a very good job.” Absolutely. But nonetheless, you understand that somewhere withinside you have chosen to hold a particular belief. You have made the choice to be involved in that reality. And if you have made the choice, then you are in control. And if you don’t like it then ultimately you also realize that you can change it. That’s the truism that you search for.
You can look, once again, through all of the books and you can look through all of the various CDs and the tapes and all of the other various methods of attempts to give you explanations and all you will find are clues. All you will find are keys. The answers are withinside. And in order for you to have that answer you must go withinside. And come to the understanding of who and what you truly are. Come to the understanding that you are the god that you search for. Absolutely. Come to the understanding that you create this reality that you are experiencing in your day-to-day activities and come to the realization that you absolutely cannot fail to come to the understanding of who and what you truly are.

You think I watch CNN? No shit, CNN's a reliable and not fake news source, and is honesty one of the best  news sources in history.I am sad that I have to clarify that big bias is not being fake and it is even worse if you say it and watch Fox News. CNN is better than fox will ever be. I wake up every day to watch CNN, one time I even had to quit my job because they wanted me to come in early and skip CNN. I am more loyal to CNN than I could be to any girl. Girls will cheat and lie to you but CNN will always be there for me. Every time I see Wolf Blitzer I immediately stop what I'm doing to listen to what he's saying, for he is the messenger of my God, Hillary. You probably just listen to whatever fake fox news tells you to, and assume they're always right.

There's clearly a nod to Banksy's "Waiting in Vain" with a dash of self-referential irony, with the shadow obviously denoting a past of a string of regrets that still haunts the subject.  And yet, there is child-like optimism in the emoji-esque removal of the nose, letting the audience know that the subject is charting their own course.  It's the tension between "today" (3d man) and shadow (on the ground) that drives viewers to question their own spirituality and relation to the universe.  Are we three-dimensional characters or shadows of God's existence?  Can we break away from our past or are we fated to a path we cannot escape?  This tension is inescapable for humanity, and the artist captures the essence of the 'everyperson' as well as the 'lost soul' and the 'shadow redeemed'.  We are all that person, and we relish our stories being told.

well i dont realy know why i even got my hopes up for this "boots to the ground" experience wich was supposed to be more realistic than previous entries...so what greets me when i enter the campaign you might ask? well the germans are wearing waffen ss eagles on the side of their caps WITH regular army insignia on the front (no waffen ss units were present on the DDAY landings) , they are using PPSH wich was a russian smg, the rate of fire on the mg42 is laughably low, almost the entire german uniform types are just plain wrong! so i exited singleplayer and entered multiplayer, the whole ♥♥♥♥ing thing is filled to the brim with quickscoping kids just ruining the whole ww2 experience! the chats are filled with trashtalking...and the developers that had the audacity to call this realistic also added BLACK WOMEN AND MEN in the german army! yes black people from the freies arabien legion were present in the war, BUT not in the regular army! they have butchered ww2 in this entry no respect AT ALL has been shown! this is no more than a bad reskin of blackops 3 minus jetpacks...if you want real ww2 go with RED ORCHESTRA 2 or day of infamy with some skin mods... DO NOT BUY THIS! and to the developers i can say this...when you decide to make a game about historical events you also have a responsibility to make history justice! no adding! no removing! no censoring! no altering! history is sacred! this game is nothing but a blatant middlefinger to ww2 and those that fought in it, this game is nothing but a cavalcade of pampering to a spoiled safespace addicted group of people that ♥♥♥♥♥ their pants when they see the sig runes or a swastika...this game could have been good...but it fell flat...this game helps to pollute history even more..an example for you here, a friend said excitedly that there was black women in ww2 fighting for the germans...i said NO there was not! he said that he saw it in cod ww2...and he asked why would a game about ww2 a historical event include german black women if there in truth realy was none?! i said that is a realy good question...the only answer i could give was they do it to be "inclusive" on the expense of history...you are helping with smearing out what happened with liberal fantasy, alot of todays youth take alot of their knowledge from the screen, no books no docus just games and films...i am a ww2 afficionado and i also collect german ww2 militaria, this pile of anti history just sickens me to the core!

Kiniro Mosaic? More like Kiniro Mexico because I am going to make Karen's hymen disappear like the Aztecs. I want to rail her senseless until she screams "TACOSUKETE, YAMERO", as I Como Agua Para Chocolate inside her. I want to fuck her until my nuts are drained dry just like the Mayan city of Teotihuacan . I bet her snatch has been used too many times like the seats on a Bullfighting Arena. But despite that I still believe that Karen is still as pure as the Río Pánuco which passes through or borders the states of Mexico, Hidalgo, Querétaro, San Luis Potosí, Tamaulipas, and Veracruz and still as wide as the Mexican Altiplano, stretching from the United States border to the Cordillera Neovolcánica, I also don't mind because I love Karen just like how Mexicans love their tequila, so much so that a one-liter bottle of limited-edition premium tequila was sold for $225,000 in July 2006 in Tequila, Jalisco, by the company Tequila Ley .925. The bottle which contained the tequila was a two-kilo display of platinum and gold. The manufacturer received a certificate from The Guinness World Records for the most expensive bottle of tequila spirit ever sold.. I also want to do a different variant of mating press with Karen, called “El Mariachi", whereby I will dominate Karen’s perfect British body eight times while wearing a charro outfit, just like how Mariachi is defined by eight socio-musical elements: mariachi instrumentation and texture, musical genres and subgenres, performance methods and styles, singing styles and forms, dance styles, performative space, performance clothing, and the word "mariachi". I also want to violate Karen just like how General Santa Anna liberated Texans in the Battle of the Alamo.

During the TAURUS Full Moon♉, the moon is reflecting the light of the Sun in SCORPIO♏. As the forces of the Sun🌞 & Moon🌙 oppose each other (Ego vs Emotions, I vs We) … our FULL MOON will have a super-charged effect as it is the first of trilogy of Supermoon over the coming 3 months taking us into 2018. What a great combination of energy, this brilliant time is best to really reflect on how you FEEL about life, to own the parts of you causing pain and then transform it into something in alignment with your heart and soul.
Understanding FULL MOON~~ Moon is fully illuminated as it sits in opposition to our Sun. The energy (influenced by the current Zodiac transit) is heightened and emotions, feelings, mental processes, dreams are all amplified. When the Sun & Moon oppose each other during a Full Moon, this can cause tension & uncomfortable friction, but at the same time a greater amplification of vision & potential possibility. The Full Moon is a powerful time of gratitude, gracefully acknowledging the beauty of life itself and all you have brought into beingness. You may feel a burning desire to express your creativity, bliss out in sensual activities & through fierce yet profoundly tender vibrations let go of any aspects of your life that no longer serve the grandest vision of your Soul. This is a great time for "moon bath"- simply sit under light of the moon & meditate – and is you breathe-in allow the moon to warm your Heart & expand the beauty of the present moment, and as you breathe-out let the light of the moon transmute that which you wish to release.🌕🌙❤🕉 #fullmoon #taurusmoon #astrology #moonchild #yoga

My best friend and I got married so we could have better health insurance and work benefits. We sometimes give each other brojobs because men need release, you know?

Eventually adopted a kid to be our bro. We raise him like our own and we're all really cool with each other.

But the other night we were going at each other and our balls touched and he didn't say "no homo". Did I marry a gay guy?

This did not include a self righteous a**whole who thinks they know what's best for everyone else.

To be fair, you have to have a very high IQ to understand Vsauce. The humour is extremely subtle, and without a solid grasp of theoretical physics most of the jokes will go over a typical viewer's head. There's also Vsauce’s optimistic outlook, which is deftly woven into his characterisation - his personal philosophy draws heavily from Narodnaya Volya literature, for instance. The fans understand this stuff; they have the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate the depths of these jokes, to realize that they're not just funny- they say something deep about LIFE. As a consequence, people who dislike Vsauce truly ARE idiots- of course they wouldn't appreciate, for instance, the humour in Vsauce's existential catchphrase "Hey Vsauce, Michael here!" which itself is a cryptic reference to Turgenev's Russian epic Fathers and Sons I'm smirking right now just imagining one of those addlepated simpletons scratching their heads in confusion as Michael Stevens’ genius unfolds itself on their television screens. What fools... how I pity them. 😂 And yes by the way, I DO have a Vsauce tattoo. And no, you cannot see it. It's for the ladies' eyes only- And even they have to demonstrate that they're within 5 IQ points of my own (preferably lower) beforehand.

If you adopt a child when you're able to have one of your own you're directly harming the human race. Survival of the fittest means that the human race will gradually improve over time but if you don't pass on your own genes and instead adopt a child who's parents clearly had shit genes (cos they're fucking dead) you're slowing evolution.

tl;dr: if you adopt while fertile you're a selfish piece of shit.

Uhm, ok. What was the point of this comment exactly? I mean, I get it. You like his comment and agree. You realized something incredible! Mindblowing. And you want to express that. I've had those times as well... let's face it, it's a normal form of communication. But, your inane comment simply adds nothing of value to the conversation. What does agreeing with him do? Does it make you feel old to be part of the team? Does it make you happy to say that you're following his thought patterns? Is this really what you want out of Life?

I think you can do better, son. That's why I'm going to use the parental approach, and give you a downvote. Not because I dislike you. But because I want to teach you this very valuable lesson. Contribute to conversation - to society, my friend. Don't be a follower, be a leader. Even if it means you get downteachered as I'm fairly certain I will (but I'm brave and wise enough to comprehend the ill and negligible value of internet points, so that's irrelevant).

I think this will be good for me. My D has taken enough abuse. The lolis, and pornstars have taken control of me and made me beat the shit out of my penis. Every night I log into my computer and jerk off until it hurts. At the end I feel satisfied. But the throbs of my dick shows its sadness. It longs for a break and to be free of this pain and torture. It only likes it when it fucks real woman, the empty air or a surface isnt enough for it. So it feels great pain. I gotta be good to a bro so Im going to give him a break. For a whole month I will not bully my dick to porn or hentai. In the end it will make my dick happy and me a better person.

The subtext of Filthy Frank points towards a man constantly struggling to prevent the only things he has from being taken from him - his friends (Red Dick, Safari Man), his family (Pink Guy), and his only source of universal power (his chromosones/MONEY).
Frank constantly fights off minons both sent from Chin-Chin (The Bourgeois) and other inhabitabts of the realms looking his chromosomes (Petit-Bourgeois). Frank also represents the socialist / populist roots of the Democratic Party, amd his replacement by Fake Frank (the one with spiderman sunglasses) represents the neoliberal rulers of the current Democratic Party, pit into plave by corporate donors (Chin-Chin). Pink Guy's disgust and eventual realization of there beong a Fake Frank is the working class searching for a new socialist hope, also represented by the return and rebirth of Real / Jesus Frank (Bernie Sanders / Ironstache). Pink Guy also turns leftward in his activism, going on antifa-esqe Nazi hunts with his dog.
We can also see how Fake Frank represents the current Democratic Party with his focus on identity politics, hanging out with both the physically disabled (Wheels) and the mentally retarded (iDubbz and maxmoefoe). His progression in both rarely discussing these figures in other videos ( lack of a commitmnent to intersectionality) and then running toward them for help, met with an instant rejection (the infamous "Steph Curry my ass") reflects how these groups reject the Democrats for being fake.
Both Frank and Fake Frank are also nearly neo-luddite in their hatred of technology. Fighting against computers and drones alike, they resort to violence to purge themselves of the coming automation apocalypse, much like how current leftists fear the power of corporate-owned technology. Fake Franks furynat being cucked by a black drone proves that fishhook theory is right - the centrists and alt-right are the same.
Finally, we can deduce that Real Frank is a hoxha-posadist because he does coke with an alien.

I don't know about you, but I get really horny whenever I see Alex Jones hosting info wars. His thicc body makes me sexually exhilarated and on many occasions I have found myself ejaculating on my computer screen. His manly conservative stature could make any sexually active individual have feelings for him. 

On separate occasions I tried calling the live Infowars show to confess my love for Alex Jones. I repeatedly go over in my head what I'd say to him but I never have the courage to do it. Sometimes I think I should describe to him the sexual fantasy I have of him where I am dominated by him in bed after he consumes one of his male vitality products. His cock would grow 15 inches in length pulverizing my asshole and it'd feel great. This fantasy is what gets me off now a days.

A couple weeks back i made my own Alex Jones love doll to satisfy my sexual desires for him. I bought an inflatable blow up doll on amazon (real high quality one, sent me back 400$ but it was worth every penny) and a large dildo called "the great American challenge". Thanks to my creative craftsman's ship I was able to print a good photo of Alex Jones's face and tape it onto the blowup dolls face. This somewhat worked in making my fantasy become real. But something feels missing.

It is no secret that I am a huge fan when it come to eating ass and as of a few days ago my mouth has been watering whenever I see Alex Jones bend down on his show. This has caused me to reach a climax like no other. I can't eat out my blow up dolls asshole since those dolls weren't meant for receiving rim jobs. 

I hope this message reaches someone who can help make my dream come true. I really want to eat that mans prefect thicc ass. As of now, I'll just have to make due with what I have 😢

To be fair, you have to have a very high IQ to understand olicity. The romance is extremely subtle, and without a solid grasp of theoretical physics most of the hacks will go over a typical viewer’s head. There’s also Olibur's nihilistic outlook, which is deftly woven into his characterisation- his personal philosophy draws heavily from Uncle Guggie's literature, for instance. The fans understand this stuff; they have the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate the depths of these dramas, to realise that they’re not just funny- they say something deep about LIFE. As a consequence people who dislike olicity truly ARE idiots- of course they wouldn’t appreciate, for instance, the humour in Felicity's existential catchphrase "No Ray, Olibur!” which itself is a cryptic reference to Sokolowski's epic Dumpsters and Fires.

It's such a shame that people are just incapable of taking responsibility for their own actions. Are we children or adults? Or something in-between (I can't think of the word, it escapes me)?

I'm just so disappointed in the human race sometimes (I swear to St. Jude's Anal Research Center, we're losing this fucking race (and against what shitty species are out there for matter (no surprise aliens don't contact us (I wouldn't either were I an alien (sometimes I wish I could be one just so I wouldn't have to communicate with idiotic humanity (particularly the Reddit community - JFC!)))))) that I find myself trying, in earnest, to find ways for you to improve yourselves, and I publicly broadcast it here in my very own comments, out of the graciousness of my heart, and out of the superior intellect of my mind.

But do you appreciate it? No. All you do is downfuck me. Typical Reddit.

Well, when the aliens do decide to come, we'll see who has the last laugh. Guess who they'll be exterminating first? I'll be watching there laughing and deservedly so. HA! HA! HA!

Last summer I went on the beach a lot and one day forgot to put sunscreen on my legs. They ended up getting pretty badly sunburnt. It hurt a lot but after about a week the skin started peeling. I ended up peeling as much as I could and it was kind of hard to stop and oddly pleasurable just removing the loose skin. I started thinking about that when I'd masturbate. Anyway, this summer I've been alternating what part of my body I don't put sunscreen on and now when it starts to hurt I'm excited and it just feels so erotic. I've been trying to stagger it like feet Monday lower legs Tuesday thighs Wednesday chest Thursday etc so there's usually skin. The allure hasn't worn off yet.

First, I read the manga every time a chapter was released.

I couldn't handle waiting for each chapter, so I said, "I'll read it every few months. Let a few chapters accumulate."

But then I got hooked on it even more, because the bigger dose lead to greater cravings.

Now I have no choice but to go cold turkey. I have to wait for the manga to finish. Will it finish? I don't know. I having withdrawal symptoms.

Fuck you Murata! Fuck you one! You're peddling comic smack! You've ruined my life!

The other day, I went to see my local crack dealer. He said he had this hot new shit and asked if I wanted to try it. I said yes; anything to wean off OPM. The gave me a wicked smile, pulled out a tablet, and showed me the OPM webcomic instead. I killed him with my bare hands.

Someone...please. I can't wait for chapters any more.

It's no wonder The Martian took best comedy. Damon's comedic timing was consistently on point. The role was a departure from Damon's typically dramatic films, and he nailed it. The Martian is a laugh-a-minute romp. The film follows funny man Watney across the 4th planet from our sun, interspersed with scenes of zany hijinks from his plucky fellow astronauts. Despite the superficially tense scenario, Damon is able to maintain an atmosphere of playfulness throughout, ensuring that the movie doesn't slip from laughs into nail-biter territory. One thing is for sure, the laughs don't let up. Like when NASA director tells the audience, “Astronaut Mark Watney... was killed.” Of course, we know better! Imagine NASAs surprise when a lowly analyst finds out that Mark Watney has been moving things around on the planet of Mars. He's not actually dead, but stranded. Whoops! But if you think they're going to tell the crew, you've got another thing coming. Wait until you see how NASA's director tries to weasel out of letting the crew know -and then trying to nix the rescue mission! After that fiasco, we see one of the greatest comedic twists of the movie, when Watney's captain, deciding to violate mission orders to save the life of a crew member, says, “this is mutiny.” Stranded on Mars, Watney's survival becomes increasingly unlikely. The people of Earth wait for the inevitable. But then, by combining the science and engineering of his friends at NASA, the bravery of his crew, and his own force of will, Watney is able to travel to another vessel and modify it for a triumphant escape, in an ending that can only be described as hilarious. Knocked unconscious by the g-force (good gracious!) and then woken up only to find he has broken ribs (ha!) Watney has to leap into the arms of a fellow astronaut on the end of a tether (that's a new one!). Needless to say, the audience was left in stitches. (Speaking of stitches, one of the film's strongest comedic moments comes when Watney is forced to sew up his own bleeding wounds, grimacing and shaking throughout.) It's no wonder The Martian picked up Best Comedy. If you're looking for a good joke, you can count on the Golden Globes.

If you are ANTI-FURRY, here's where I'd like you to read the most.

Furries, like I said, are a culture just like Gays, Cliques (Jocks, Emos, Preps...), Religion, Vampires, White and Colored people, Countries, etc...
We are PROUD, but the sad part is many of us are too scared to express ourselves for fear we will be verbally bashed or physically abused. If you are Gay, fit into a clique, are religious, or have colored skin, and have been verbally or physically abused, did it hurt? Did you fight for your stand? If not, would you if you were?
Although you Anti-Furries may not see it, bashing Furry culture is like being racist. It is just the same as protesting Gay Marriage. It is exactly the same as bashing a religion. If you support those who have or yourself have colored skin, support Gay Marriage, or are religious, think of how hurt you'd feel and how much you'd try to defend your beliefs.

Many Anti-Furries get mad when Furries defend themselves. But you'd do the same in the same situation.

To further explain my prior example.
"Some priests have sexually molest little boys, but it doesn't mean all of them do". Some priests HAVE done this, it has been all over the news. But people are STILL religious. While some people stopped going to that church, or maybe few stopped being religious, there are still millions upon millions of people who still follow their faith and don't believe EVERY priest molests little boys.

To say ALL or MOST Furries are perverted sexual deviants, is like saying "ALL ravers are druggies", "ALL Muslims are killers because of 9/11", "ALL pregnant teens are irresponsible people", and that "ALL Priests are molesters because some have had sex with young boys". 
NONE of these statements are true. Just as not all Furries are horrible, perverted, disgusting, sexually driven people.

You should NEVER judge someone based on how they look or dress or behave based on what others in their same culture have done.



TO MY FELLOW FURRIES...
Be PROUD, but don't be forceful. STAND UP for yourself, but don't be rude.
Many Furry haters hate us because we shove our culture into their faces, instead of talking and trying help them understand. Nobody will listen if they are being harassed. They will go into defense mode and just hate you more. Tell them you are proud to be you, and say nothing more unless they ask. We want to educate people, not push them away, or they will never listen.



I respect everyone's right to opinion, and while I love a good HEALTHY argument, will never deem a wrong until I know 100% they are by doing the research necessary to know.
I will never bash a person for who they are and for their beliefs without talking, asking, and getting the full story from them first.
I never judge on impact, but rather I judge those who give me reason to.

I may be merely fifteen years old and still have my schooling to attend to, but my parents just don't get it.

Everyday, I go onto my computer to work on getting my rank up - to improve, and perhaps show those who shunned me that I am an independent Mercy main who don't need no man to boost me up to Diamond.

However, my parents just don't get my determination. "Stop spending all your time on that game," they say. "Get up and do something productive, like some sports!"

Well, mother, I am doing something productive! This is just as productive as a bunch of sweaty men kicking a ball around a grass field, I'm sure.

Hey, Vsauce -- Michael here. I would like to talk to you about black holes. You see black holes can actually be used as euphemisms for asshole. Take your mums asshole for instance. It's gape reaches across the galaxies. Galaxies are actually a collection of a bunch of stars. Collection coming from Latin word collectus meaning "to collect". You know what else is fun to collect? Stamps. Originated in England they actually were first used in France by Napoleon to order mail brides from Russia. In Russian empire there are these things called babushkas. They are dolls with many layers, each containing a smaller version of itself. According to a new study, the universe could also be made up of such layers. In one layer I could be cock juggling clown having a cock for a penis and you could be straight. But how do we define straight? What Is a line in mathematics? A line goes on forever. Forever is a wonderful concept which is difficult to graps with out tiny brains. According to new research from neuroscience your brain is actually finite. But accoriding to an ancient Greek philosopher. If you were to spank me, you could never actually do it, since your hadn has to travel hakf the way to my voluptuous bottom, and then a fourth and an eight, and so on. Speaking of Greece did you know that they had a steady decline in culture and economy for the past few thousands years, culminating in the poverty that they live in now. Did you know that povery actually originated in the ancient Mesopotamia? It was invented by the aristocracy to keep the man down and impose obedience. Aristocracy did a lot of weird shit. Such has proclaiming themselves to be gods in ancient Egypt and in doing some force themselves to mate with each other, since they couldn't mate with normies, in doing so inventing incest. Inventing was invented in England during the industrial age, and it gave birth to the computers which run on Quantum Mechanics. Quantum luctuations are what gave birth to black holes.

are there people who actually thinking sucking dick is gay?

 1. you're sharing protein

 2. you're admiring masculine physique

 3. being in the vacinity of other high testosterone males increases your own testosterone

eating pussy is gay because you're litterally slurping down estrogen. and long term relationships have been proven to lower testosterone.

spartans had gay orgies all the time and they were the height of masculinity. you bet they were at least fondling eachothers test producers.

The reasons to side with the Legion are larger scoped than the others. It requires looking at the point in time as a long series of events of the world, and which faction would make the world better in the long run. The legion is purely based on meritocracy, caeser presumably has no children, so "nobility" his inner circle is earned not given. They're as brutal as fuck, but so has 95% of human history. Do the means justify the ends. Well he's trying to reshape humans slightly. He wants a Pax Romana, and he despises corrupt governments presumably because his family lived in one and it was only the goodwill of the followers and not the NCR that was supposed to protect them from raiders who helped. In the long run the purity of the legion is good for humanity. It still eats me up whenever I choose them, but the alternative is literally a wild wasteland with an implied ending Yes man may go Skynet rogue with the robots, the Machine Demi god Mr House, who isn't a bad choice, but all he cares about is himself and his precious city, and control. Or the NCR who being the only other true human faction can be contrasted directly yo the legion. They have some very nice people working for them. But it remains painfully evident through exploring dialogue and events in the game they are woefully corrupt, the rich basically control their political process, the rich can break the laws, the laws and order being the main selling point of the NCR. They are also just as expansionist as the legion, and use attack dogs like Colonel Moore to enforce these agendas when underhand diplomacy fails. The NCR is powered by greed, a greed that manifests as systemic evil. The NCR could be described as an oligarchy that serves only the desires of the rich, the Legion can be described more as an encoded dictatorship, where the dictator enforces the code the legion stands by, to uplift humans from corruption and petty fighting. The legion doesn't hate the NCR, they just find their governing styles repugnant. In opposition to house, the legion is also all about the triumph of the human will, man does not need an army of robots, man is strong enough to rely without robots, or nuclear weapons, or oil, the catalysts which caused the Great War. In that way caeser could be argued to be the ultimate follower of the Apocalypse.

Disney are no newcomers to the social engineering business. They have been instilling princess complexes in the vulnerable minds of little girls for 80 years now. We see the results all around us: several generations of women with an overblown view of their own importance, and millions of dysfunctional and dissatisfied lives worldwide.

With Moana they're taking it to the next level.

Now it's about turning the little princesses-in-training into full blown radical feminists - Disney is now teaching little girls that men are 100 % useless and women don't need them! This is a part of a carefully orchestrated campaign against heterosexual pair bonding, designed to curb population growth. You've seen the "men are stupid" meme repeated over and over in movies and TV commercials in recent years, so it's not just Disney that is engaging in this cultural attack on the family unit.

These secretly scheming social engineers do have a point - there *is* a population problem and it needs to be tackled before humanity destroys the earth altogether. It's just that some of us would prefer it if this discussion could be held in the open instead of through massive manipulative brainwashing campaigns targeting children!

I'll probably be making some "spoilers" in the following, so if you like to watch your depopulation propaganda with pristine eyes, look away now! In short, the basic premise of the movie is that all males are stupid, shortsighted, egocentric, cowardly, and useless in general. In contrast, all females are smart, wise, caring, humble-yet-know-when-to-step-to-the-fore, brave, and just generally capable of anything.

This message is not-so-subtly hammered into the viewer's head at every turn with every character and every interaction. But the main thrust of the movie centers around two characters, a 12-year old looking pretty little girl called Moana, and a male "demigod" who conveniently displays every negative personality trait known to mankind in every scene. He is also ugly as sin, because as we all know pretty=good and ugly=bad. They're trying to not be too subtle for the audience here.

The world is threatened by destruction, which of cause was caused by the *male* demigod, and the Island where Moana lives will also soon be destroyed because the *male* chieftain refuses to expand his perspectives and insists on holding back the only force that can fix the problem. Which would be a 12-year old *female*. So Moana sets out on a quest to save the world by dragging the naughty demigod kicking and screaming back to the scene of the crime to force him to undo his evil deeds.

During their journey together we are repeatedly shown that even a male demigod can't do anything right, and it takes a 12-year old girl to do it for him. There is one key scene where the demigod is feeling down and is sort of having a self-reflective moment or something. He says "I'm nothing without my magic fishhook".

If this was a normal movie, not a propaganda piece trying to poison young minds, then this would have been a moment of growth where he would one way or the other have learned that he is indeed worth something just as he is, and his magic fishhook doesn't define him. You know, basic character growth stuff. But he is not a character who is allowed to grow. He is a MAN and the point of the scene is not to show his inner worth, but to do the exact opposite - the movie shows that he really *is* nothing without his magic fishhook by not making the least effort to give a counterpoint. He says he is nothing, the movie pauses a second so the message will sink in, and then it moves on without resolving his crisis of self worth. Because that's the point: Young women are meant to absorb the message men are nothing.

Even "demigods"!

I'm running out of space to point out all occurrences of this brainwashing, so I'll just list a few more points in bullet form:

The magical ocean helps Moana whenever she stumbles. The ocean is a representation of the collective subconscious force, so this hammers in the message that Moana has greater powers on her side and cannot fail.

The demigod who is nothing without his fishhook loses it. Then a *goddess* returns it to him, but only after he has humbled himself and asked for her forgiveness. This shows that the male only has power when the female gives it to him, and that she can withdraw his power at any time. How's that for a feminist message? There is a comic-relief "chicken" that is more stupid than any other chicken who ever walked this Earth. The subtle point is that the chicken is a *rooster*, and therefore yet another example of a useless male. The "patriarchy" is visualized as stones laid on top of stones at the summit of a mountain. At the end of the Movie Moana lays a pink seashell that looks like a vagina on top of the pile. A clear symbolic reference to woman usurping male power.

I hate crowds. It's crowds and their crowdthink that ruin society. Reddit is an example of crowdthink, which I hate.
It really is downright awful. When the vast majority of Reddit's content is utter hooey, viewing such blaggadry all the time can only lead to further harm. Honestly, if most of Reddit's posts seem interesting to you, then, my friend, I think you need a serious chiroredditic adjustment! 😅
Not to offend your sensibilities, of course, but I've been on this website for less than one day, and boy oh boy, is there a lot of garbage. And that's considering just what's on the front page, which is supposed to be the epitome of content that we consume from the contemporary, modern World Wide Web.
I was introduced to this website with such high expectations. Lol and behold... I came to disappointment (that wouldn't be the first time I came to disappointment, of course (particularly in my house and bedroom (wait, I know this sounds dirty, but it isn't (it's referring to very personal experiences (but not sexual ones (at least not how the traditional Redditor defines them (granted, I doubt the average Redditor knows much about sexual experiences given what I've seen here today))))))). I, of course, don't want my friends to experience similar disappointment, and thus, vow to ensure I will prevent any ore new people from visiting this website.
Of course, efforts of such gigantic proportions require critical planning and subtle yet powerful execution. I must, therefore, start by fighting the system from within. The mission has begun.

are there people who actually thinking sucking dick is gay?

 1. you're sharing protein

 2. you're admiring masculine physique

 3. being in the vacinity of other high testosterone males increases your own testosterone

eating pussy is gay because you're litterally slurping down estrogen. and long term relationships have been proven to lower testosterone.

spartans had gay orgies all the time and they were the height of masculinity. you bet they were at least fondling each others test producers.

I honestly do not remember the encounter, it would have been over 30 years ago, but if I did behave then as he describes, I owe him the sincerest apology for what would have been deeply inappropriate drunken behaviour, and I am sorry for all the feelings he describes having carried with him all these years. 
This story has encouraged me to address other things in my life... I have loved and had romantic encounters with men throughout my life, and I now choose to live life as a gay man.

In the scope of Human development, no step has been critical to modern society then the invention of the teletubbies. Beyond that though, consider life in the stars? Why would we need to ground our ambitions if there is no gravity to ground it? Space is needed to establish a truly human specimen around the entire planetoids of the Milky Way chocolate bar. Even if you ate this chocolaty delight your comprehension of the finer points of thermodynamics wouldn't improve nor would human understanding of our lovely atmosphere touching inside all of us. Even if we took the notional dynamics to a new level, surely god would forgive us for our transgressions. Even if the all mighty didn't we could repent and create a new dynasty adherent to His principles. 10 years on this blessed dynasty may even ascend to the higher plane of thinking and when we “put our heads together” so to say (laugh) we could even keep the ones we care about from dying (pause 8.3 seconds for applause). Even still we must consider how mainly are already in vain of our notional attributes. If this physical plain can't contain our might then we must truly exchange our capitalistic ideas for a more communist experience based on the lack of substantial materialist. Why then must we continue to seek the promised land of our own desires. Join us in the ethereal plain my fellow breathers and diploids, unite in the song of life, the song of the universe and may we be blessed like the teletubbies before us. I yield my time to questions by those whose knowledge of creation supersedes the creators own experience.

Doctor: Is your child immunized?

Me: Yes

Doctor: It's not in his records.

Me: Why would it be?

Doctor: What do you mean?

Me: What do you mean?

Doctor: Who immunized your child?

Me: My wife and I.

Doctor: What do you mean?

Me: What do you mean?

Doctor: How did you and your wife immunize your child?

Me: She birthed him naturally at home and breastfed him for the first year and a half of his life, and we both make sure he eats nutritionally dense organic foods. We also make sure he spends a lot of time in the sun moving his body daily out in nature connected to the earth, and pretty much only drinks water that comes straight from a natural spring without any fluoride or chlorine in it.

Doctor: But I asked you if your child has been vaccinated, and you said “yes!”

Me: No, you asked me if my child has been immunized, and I said “yes.”

Doctor: Vaccinations...immunizations...same thing!

Me: Uhhh...you keep using that word, but I don't think you know what it means...

Doctor: What do you mean?

Me: What do you mean?

Doctor: (visibly frustrated) Never mind. Are you going to have him vaccinated or not?

Me: Why would I?

Doctor: So he doesn't get sick.

Me: But he doesn't get sick now.

Doctor: Never?

Me: Not really, no. 

Doctor: Ear infections?

Me: Never had one.

Doctor: Is he allergic to any medications?

Me: I don't know...he's never had any.

This whole post is just ridiculous. Where do I even begin? Let's see. Well to start off, the idea that a cavern this large could support itself without immediately collapsing is preposterous. No columns. No supports. Not even a fucking I-Beam. Where did you go to architectural school? Macedonia?

And the lava. The LAVA. Magma is slow. IT DOESNT RUN LIKE WATER. There are no such things as magma falls, okay kid? If the lava was coming down from the subterranean ceiling like that then it would actually solidify from the air cooling it off. It would be dark grey, with maybe some goey red cracks and stuff. Just retarded.

Oh and if there was lava up top above (as would be necessary) to flow down like your retarded picture suggests, then guess what? IT WOULD MELT THROUGH THE CEILING. So stupid. I just can't with this. Too far. Piss off.

Hey, Vsauce, Michael here! Down here. But which way is down? And how much does down weigh? Well, down weighs about 1/100 of a g/cm^3 .  It is light, and airy, which makes it a great source of insulation and buoyancy for waterbirds.  But if you let go of down, it falls down. So that's which way down is, it's the direction that gravity is pulling everything. Now for someone on the other side of the Earth, my down is their up, but where are falling things going? Why do things fall? Are they being pushed or pulled? Or, is it because of **TIME  TRAVEL.**

I used to be like that. My mother always said that curse words would ruin my tongue if I said it. I was a sweet ten year old Christian boy that would never swear. 

"Oh man!"

"Gosh darn it!"

"Holy moley!"

I would even get scolded for even saying "What the freak?" My mother was very strict about it, and told me lies to keep me in check. Like how not going to school would eventually make me bedridden. 

Then, just last year, I discovered anime(_irl). That's when my life turned upside down. The corruption of the internet tainted my adolescent mind. My ten year old brain couldn't comprehend why my wee-wee was getting stiff from this woman getting eaten by a giant monster while her eyes rolled back into her skull and her tongue was like a flaccid uncontrollable snake.

Now I'm a cunty twenty-four year old woman that feeds off of stuffing her slit with the latest Polaroid camera so that I can plaster my neighborhood with what the inside of the deepest hole in the world would look like. I entertain at parties by regurgitating used condoms and making balloon animals out of them.

Semen for breakfast, heroin for lunch, and IV bags for dinner. If dick wasn't going through my mind, then I'm going brain dead.

My family cut all ties with me, and I don't know where they are anymore. I miss them. I miss people missing me.

Anime was a fucking mistake.

Trading Laws. 

These are my laws, and I will not break them. 

I decline friend requests more often than accepting them. If adding me, comment why. 

If I decline you, I am either not interested in your inv, or Ik you're a scammer. 

I only do straight trades. I will never send anyone an empty trade NO MATTER WHAT! 

As of right now, I am only trading CSGO items. If I see anything in a trade offer from any other game, I will instantly decline it. 

If you want to buy my skins with money, I only use OPSkins. No exceptions. 

I don't overpay for stickers, unless they're Katowice 2014, Howling Dawn, and Crowns. 

I never give items away. Beggars are annoying as heck. 

I dont overpay for floats unless they're like 0.0003 or something like that.

I only overpay for the Float of FN items. I don't care if your FT knife has a .18 float, it's still a FT to me.

I may add a little extra if it's like .004 off the next level.

I don't trust anyone. It's nothing personal. 

I always check the values of trades. I know what I have, so sharking doesn't work on me. 

Scammers, don't even try. I've been scammed before, and it won't happen again.

I dont believe "+reps". I also have none on my profile, because I know they can be faked. If you say to me that you can be trusted because of +reps, I will instantly block you. 

If I add you, I am interested in one or more items you have. I won't add you if I can't afford one or more items. 

These are my rules. I keep to them, and I recommend you don't try to break them.

To be fair, you have to be super unoriginal to make Rick and Morty copypasta’s. The joke is extremely unfunny, and without a solid grasp of theoretical copy and pasting most of the “comedy” will go over a typical viewer’s head. There’s also the copypasta’s overused outlook, which is deftly woven into its characterisation- its overuse draws heavily from MrMrMangohead literature, for instance. The veteran copypasters understand this stuff; they have the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate the depths of copypasta’s, to realise that they’re not just original- they aren’t some shitty Rick and Morty copypasta KNOCKOFF. As a consequence people who make Rick & Morty copypastas truly ARE idiots- of course they wouldn’t appreciate, for instance, the humour in the Toucan copypasta’s existential catchphrase “Le toucan has arrived,” which itself is a cryptic reference to Turgenev’s Russian epic Fathers and Sons. I’m smirking right now just imagining one of those addlepated simpletons scratching their heads in confusion as they read the Navy Seal copypasta’s genius wit unfold itself on their computer screens. What fools.. how I pity them. 😂

The ruler is 30cm/300mm long and features measurements in cm and inches. The measurements are easy to read and the plastic is see-through. The ruler feels a tad flimsy due to its slightly weak build quality. This is to be expected considering its price point. It also has huge barcodes and logos printed across the ruler which totally ruin the aesthetic. Overall, this is a solid ruler which is well worth the money. Although it has minor complaints, these won't bother most people so it's a cracking purchase for only 70p.

it seems as though young sheldom transcends easy fanservice. clearly there is a desire to produce quality television, and CBS has delivered it.

As a fan of the incredibles I am deeply offended. How can I not obsess about how PERFECT the incredibles is. For example, when Syndrome confidently strides towards his cool manta ray plane after easily overpowering the entire Incredibles family he wipes the snot from his nose. The level of detail I swear. I feel the writers could’ve just made him this bland villain like most superhero movies nowadays but no, they decided to make him flawed, compelling, and human. This movie is the essence of perfection, something far better than anything else fictitious or real. I own five blue ray copies of the incredibles even tho I don’t have a blue ray DVD player. I pray to these copies every night and ask that the world be more like the incredibles canon. Maybe I wouldn’t be so obsessed if everyone was a cartoon animated character. Do you ever think about that Kaila? Maybe I can’t talk about anything besides the incredibles because that film is just too perfect. As a true intellectual nihilist I can tell you that nothing is of value except the incredibles. I watched a couple YouTube videos about Niche so trust me I am of a much higher intellectual capacity than you are and since I am smarter in all regards my opinion is greater than yours. Everything is pointless except the incredibles. Wake up sheeple

I wouldn’t be here if it wasn’t for Danica Patrick.

I watch sports- I’m a sports consumer. I’m an F1 and Carolina Panthers fan, and my third sport used to be golf. Now it’s NASCAR, and what got me here was Danica Patrick.

I used to watch the whole weekend of regular PGA stops, and all four days of majors. I attended in-person tournaments and bought merchandize. I gave careful consideration to the luxury vehicles and financial products sold by the sponsors that paid the checks. Now I watch Cup, Xfinity and truck racing every weekend. I attended Martinsville and Charlotte and bought merchandize. I give careful consideration to the diabetes and COPD treatment products sold by the sponsors that pay the checks. I even bought Nascar Heat 2- the video game.

Now that I’m here I recognize the incredible will-to-win and raw talent of Kyle Busch, the engineering genius of the 78 team, the mercurial talent of Kyle Larson, the master tactician Jimmie Johnson and even poor little Denny Hamlin. I get it. These are the best of the best in stock car racing and I love watching them perform and battle for the lead.

I know Danica won’t win, and I never expected her to but I’ve seen her pass good cars, I’ve seen her run up front, I’ve heard her courage and awesome, profane determination on the radio. I see she has a passion for the sport.

She also is someone that my wife and my 15yo daughter can relate to. She’s the reason I can get them up to Martinsville on a freezing day, listening to the scanner and eating hotdogs on a cold metal bleacher, loving the experience, and helping to pay NASCAR’s bills.

None of the PGA tour crowd could have achieved that.

MHFU. FU is the truer version of MH. The game was designed to be played on the PSP. When they switched over to 3DS they lost the unique combat aspect of the camera angle. The 3DS is uncomfortable to wield respectively. Even with the CCP or the C-stick the game is still more comfortable and more stable with the PSP controls. The claw technique was integral and is now a lost art. Gen doesn't feel like MH. The AI is different, the controls feel sightly off, the arts are flashy, the damage numbers for all the weapons are the same which bugged me to no end (like a charge blade and hammer could both be maxed at 200 damage. WHAT?!?). How am I supposed to tell that the Great Sword does like 4 times more damage than the SnS? MHFU just had more....respect?

Australia is not real. It’s a hoax, made for us to believe that Britain moved over their criminals to someplace. In reality, all these criminals were loaded off the ships into the waters, drowning before they could see land ever again. It’s a coverup for one of the greatest mass murders in history, made by one of the most prominent empires. Australia does not exist. All things you call “proof” are actually well-fabricated lies and documents made by the leading governments of the world. Your Australian friends? They’re all actors and computer-generated personas, part of the plot to trick the world.If you think you’ve ever been to Australia, you’re terribly wrong. The plane pilots are all in on this, and have in all actuality only flown you to islands close nearby – or in some cases, parts of South America, where they have cleared space and hired actors to act out as real Australians. Australia is one of the biggest hoaxes ever created, and you have all been tricked. Join the movement today, and make it known that they have been deceived. Make it known, that this has all just been a cover-up. The things these “Australian” says to be doing, all these swear words and actions based on alcoholism, MDMA and bad decisions, are all ways to distract you from the ugly truth that is one of the greatest genocides in history. 162,000 people were said to have been transported to this imaginary land during a mere 80 years, and they are all long dead by now. They never reached that promised land. Tell the truth. Stand up for what is right. Make sure to spread the world – Australia is not real. It’s a codeword for the cold-blooded murder of more than a hundred thousand people, and it is not okay. We will not accept this.Stand up for the ones who died.

I've had those times as well... let's face it, it's a normal form of communication. But, your inane comment simply adds nothing of value to the conversation. What does this do? Does it make you feel old to be part of the team? Does it make you happy to say that you're following his thought patterns? Is this really what you want?

I think you can do better, son. That's why I'm going to use the parental approach, and give you a downvote. Not because I dislike you. But because I want to teach you this very valuable lesson. Contribute to conversation - to society, my friend. Don't be a follower, be a leader. Even if it means you get downteachered as I'm fairly certain I will (but I'm brave and wise enough to comprehend the ill and negligible value of internet points, so that's irrelevant).

Who fucking cares if you didn't find it funny? That doesn't mean you downvoted it. Do you know what the up and down arrows are used for in the overall rules of Reddit? Upvotes are used to credit someone for contributing to discussion. Downvotes are used to hide comments that do no contribute to discussion. Not if you don't like the post or not. This person made another joke on top of the post, contributing to the discussion. I'm sick and fucking tired of all these retarded children on this gay ass website. Fuck off, all of you.

Why are you wishing this guy luck? How he does on his test is entirely on him. I mean yeah, we all like seeing each other succeed, but wishing luck is nothing but an empty gesture, because it literally doesn’t do anything. It’s solely up to him how he does. It’s like if I told you “good luck making your next comment.” What would you think? Same logic here.
Well, good luck making your next comment, OP Juan Canopy!

Please tell me what have we Indians ever done to white people? What have we ever done to them? They are the ones who invaded our homeland. They are the ones who exploited us, mocked us, and abused us. Have we ever invaded and oppressed whites somewhere or sometime in history that I don't know about? Have we waged biological or chemical or psychological or social warfare against them? Are we blowing up and killing their people?
In the white-majority countries we live in, we Indians are among the best (if not outright the best) citizens. We have the lowest crime rates, highest academic achievements, lowest divorce rates, lowest rates of single motherhood, and lowest tendency to abuse the social welfare system. At the least, with respect to other races and ethnicities, whites may have some legitimate arguments about crime or welfare abuse or "immorality" or whatever. What the fuck have we Indians ever done to these people that they hate us so much? What have we done to them for them to abuse India's unfortunate poverty and use it as a weapon to mock us about "pajeets" and "poo in loo" and "designated" and other older memes like "dot-head" or "apu"?
The answer becomes extremely obvious when you think about it. I shouldn't have to explain it because it is indeed too obvious. So now you tell me not to paint them with a broad brush? No, years of reading these comments on the internet on literally every comment section that has something to do with Indians/India will create hatred as well. Except, this hatred I have is at least justifiable. This hatred is a response, a defense against aggressors, not unprovoked. Its immensity is overpowering and I refuse to give them space for excuses anymore because they never have and never will give in-return. So fuck whitey, and if you have a problem with me saying that, then fuck you too.

Do you know what the m97 flamethrower sounds like Bert? It roars like a dragon a fiery god purging every thing in its path...   Hold down that trigger and the whoosh drowns out everything else. Focus on the noise and you can almost convince yourself you don't hear the screams. By the time the tank is empty everything is over... Even the men are quiet there is nothing but the crackling of burning thatch. You see bert, its not the noise that keeps me awake at night. ITS THE SILENCE﻿

Found on a Habitica user's about page. Truly heavenly. (Removed a few links that were in the original)

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Jesus Christ is LORD and SAVIOUR and the light of this world! He as God came into this fallen world 2000~ years ago, born in Bethlehem in what is now Palestine as a male under Jewish authority, and came to reveal his glorious plan of salvation in his 20s, being eventually killed for 'blasphemy' by the Sanhedrin in 32/33 AD~, and rose again on the third day, being given all authority on heaven and on earth. However, He was even revealed from the very beginnings through the prophets all through the old testament, an artistic weaving from the master storyteller that tells the story of man falling and Christ picking us up in his love, even laying down his own life for us and our transgressions. And He reaches out to the spiritually needy in his great love! He manifested Himself to me when I was totally down and out, and showed me the depth of his unconditional, PERFECT love that He has for everybody. He is a pure light brighter than any other, but can be looked at forever; He has no deception in Him whatsoever, only the purest love and concern for us; powerful, anxiety-and-pride-killing peace emanates from Him and bathes anyone witnessing His glory into total fulfillment, killing all the ambitions, desires and covetousness of the flesh and being truly satisfied and humbled in His LOVE, and his love alone. His love is literally incredible and can bring ANYONE to tears. He also certainly had a beard when he revealed Himself to me in His majestic glory, but His face wasn't as clear. This is no lie, or mere hallucination! There is so much more to life than dissatisfying materialism. My life had become completely astray, but God showed Himself to me and it was and is being completely changed by the good King and Saviour Jesus Christ! The rulers of this world want you to believe that Godlessness is the way, the truth, and the life - but it leads to certain death, not only spiritually in this life, but also in the life to come. Please, brother or sister, see what I have to say - the Lord will NEVER force you to repent and believe but would rejoice greatly for you to repent (in your thoughts, in your heart) and come into his arms (2 Peter 3:9, also the parable of the prodigal son, with the father representing Jesus Christ). Read on for the salvation of the Lord!
"For I delivered unto you first of all that which I also received, how that Christ died for our sins according to the scriptures; and that he was buried, and that he rose again the third day according to the scriptures; and that he was seen by Cephas, then of the twelve; after that, he was seen of above five hundred brethren at once; of whom the greater part remain unto this present, but some are fallen asleep. (1 Corinthians 15:3-6)
Do you want to be saved and receive forgiveness for your sins, a life with Jesus Christ as King and Saviour who loves you so incredibly much it's magical, and receive the Holy Ghost of God and eternal life in heaven? Believe the above, which is the Gospel of Christ (that he died for our sins - salvation is by grace, through (our) faith, in Him and his sacrifice for our sins - NOT by works - yet he saves us to do good works that were prepared beforehand by God (Ephesians 2:8-10) and trust in this. More importantly, you must believe you are a sinner: “For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God (Romans 3:23)" and that you deserve to die for transgressing the law of God, even currently - no excuses. "For the wages of sin is death; but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord. (Romans 6:23) And so, you put your trust in Jesus Christ and on his death on the cross AND his resurrection (“That if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved.” (Romans 10:9)). And there you are - according to the Bible - you are saved if you believe the Gospel - and then, if you do, the words should not be forced, but should flow from the heart - JESUS IS LORD. If you want to be sure, if you have read this and believe in your heart that Jesus had died on the cross for ALL your sins, past, present and future, and that he was raised from the dead on the third day, then you can pray this: “God, I know I am a sinner. I believe Jesus was my substitute when He died on the Cross. I believe His shed blood, death, burial, and resurrection were for me. I now receive Him as my Saviour. I thank You for the forgiveness of my sins, the gift of salvation and everlasting life, because of Your merciful grace. Amen.” This information is backed up by this trustworthy page, that adheres heavily to the Bible, God's inspired Word.
So, if you have now been saved by God and want to grow in the faith, do those things - read God's Word daily, pray to God daily (he wants to hear you, so you should really do this often), have fellowship with others, and practice obedience to God, which is discipleship. Part of this is baptism, which should be done as a step of obedience to God, AFTER being saved, to enter into an eternal covenant with our Lord. Finally, have fellowship with believers, and witness to unbelievers the Lord Jesus Christ, through your actions and words. And remember! God does the saving, all of it! You just need to believe on Him (Acts 16:31). If you truly believe on Him, your actions and life will come to reflect this; but be patient. God works outside of time, because he created it and is thus sovereign over it.
"And the GLORY of the LORD shall be revealed, and all flesh shall see it together; for the mouth of the LORD hath spoken it!" Isaiah 40:3-5. "For I am NOT ashamed of the gospel of Christ; for it is the power of God unto salvation to every one that BELIEVETH; to the Jew first, and also to the Greek." Romans 1:16.
Have a good day, beloved brother or sister. If you read all of that, and now or already believed in the gospel of Christ, thank the Lord in gratitude and love - for this was written to YOU and to Him, the reason being that it might hopefully convince you to come to repentance and a saving relationship with Jesus Christ our Lord and God. If you have been saved today, this is only the beginning of a wonderful life-long relationship with the almighty creator of our universe, the Lord Jesus Christ.

To be fair, you have to have a very high IQ to understand the implication of Cuts Like a Knife. Bryan Adams’ precise thoughts are extremely subtle, and without a solid grasp of an analogous situation most of the significance of the prudently constructed lyrics will go over a typical listener’s head. There’s also Bryan’s profound outlook, which is deftly woven into the song—his personal philosophy draws heavily from amorous literature, for instance. The true listeners understand this matter; they have the mental and emotional capacity to truly appreciate the depths of the lyrics, to realize that they’re not just funny—they say something deep about their situations, too.  As a consequence, people who dislike Cuts Like a Knife truly ARE idiots- of course they wouldn’t appreciate, for instance, the humor in Bryan’s existential catchphrase “…it cuts like a knife, but it feels so right…” which itself is a cryptic reference to a situation faced my many young adolescents. I’m smirking right now just imagining one of those addlepated simpletons scratching their heads in confusion as Bryan Adams’ genius wit unfolds itself into their ears. What fools…how I pity them.

And yes, by the way, I DO have a Cuts Like a Knife tattoo. And no, you cannot see it. It’s for the ladies’ eyes only—and even then they have to validate that they’re within 5 IQ points of my own (preferably lower) beforehand. Nothing personal.

In August, if anyone would have told me I’d be watching the PGA tour on a Thursday night instead of watching the NFL Thursday night game of the week, I would have said “your crazy.”  I watched 15 minutes of the Bills/Jets game and switch back to the Golf Channel.  Not because the game is a drag of a game, it’s because it is more important to honor our flag, then to watch a bunch of spoiled overpaid athletes protest during our National Anthem.

I will always be there...
You are not forsaken....
For I am a Dying soul never healed...
I am a rising soul of the once forsaken..
One by one, like leaves from a tree..
All my faiths have forsaken me...
But..
To be left alone is not always to be forsaken...
Can you even remember,
Who you were before the world told you who you should be?
Now I am only a shade of shadow..
You ask why?
Well....
How can you count yourself a knight....
When you have forsaken every vow you ever swore?
All hands have forsaken you...
But, my friend...
I will never leave you...
Nor forsaken you...
Because...
A thousand half-loves must be forsaken...
To take one whole heart home...

To forsake is not to be forsaken

Fapping to trap porn is the least gay thing there is. If you fap to gay porn, that's 2 guys, and that's 100% gay. If you fap to 'straight' porn, then that has a woman, sure, but you're also fapping to a guy, which makes it 50% gay. But a trap is like half male, half female, and thus a trap with a girl would add up to 75% girl, and thus only 25% gay. 2 women would be ideal, but that would be a lesbian relationship, which brings it around to gay again.

Then there's consent. If a person doesn't consent to something, but the other person does it anyway, that makes the other person stronger, and thus less gay. Let's say that means they're about 50% less gay. If it was gay rape, that means that it's now 75% gay. If it's straight rape by a man, then it's 25% gay. And, if it's trap gay porn, than that's 12.5% gay. So technically, yes, rape trap porn is the least gay porn there is, but that's still looped in with trap porn, hence why fapping to trap porn is the least gay thing there is.

NO! Cockroaches are my favorite insects 😭 did you know they form strong family bonds and if separated from their family's will often develop depression, stop eating, display anxiety, and even die? They also have something similar to a hippocampus which means they retain memories. They can tell their family members apart, have the ability to learn and rationalize, make complex decisions based on their own will, but also make collective decisions for the greater good based on the opinions of other individual roaches. They will display antisocial tendencies and depression if placed with other foreign cockroaches, and if they are separated from other roaches at a young age they will be stunted socially, meaning they have a harder time later in life socializing with other cockroaches and will be less successful at obtaining a mate. They even have individual personality types.

And many scientists even believe they may posses consciousness.

PLUS! We assume insects don't feel pain, because they are so different from us. But what if I told you we actually don't know if they do or do not feel pain? Because we don't know. BUT! Alot of research is leaning towards the possibility that they do in fact feel pain.

Please be nice to roaches and insects 😭 they don't hurt nobody!﻿

> I am here to tell you a story. My story. I am directly responsible for what happened in this thread, although I was not the person that baited the victim personally in this case. I am indirectly responsible for literally thousands of baited bans in this game across all regions over the past two years.This is much bigger than you all realize, Riot employees like Tantram included. The scale of my actions are likely unprecedented in the gaming community in respect to the methods and techniques I have employed here. Once I had the required data, I used tricks like the one described here to get people banned. I had a good time doing it by myself, as I got over 200 bans (at least 70 of them confirmed permas) in the first month, by myself, back in January of 2016. I even trolled with a Riot employee in my game using these methods, and he stated that this issue would be escalated to the highest levels. I never got banned... After some time something magical happened. Friends and strangers started noticing I could get people banned. Toxic people, bad people. No one else could get it done it seemed, only me. So they started asking me how I did it.

> This is when things changed. I realized I could build an army. An army of followers to do my bidding for me. I started training people on how to manipulate and exploit the IFS. This worked pretty well, with only a few people who did not follow my precise instructions getting hit with bans. Drawing upon the Ponzi schemes of past and present, I built a foundation of perceived financial gains from getting people falsely banned. I told people $40 per ban, payable after the first 50 bans. The first time I told some random kid this he went nuts and followed my instructions. He really thought he was going to get paid for tricking people into getting banned. By January of 2017 I had 14 people believing this and sending me up to 100 screenshots per day of ban popups. When people would complain about not getting paid I would send them a Riot RP Card. It was amazing how long I could string them along getting 5 to 20 bans per day with a simple gift card. To my knowledge most of them still believe they are going to get paid and over the last week I have confirmed about 80 bans per day on average. At my peak in August, I had over 70 operatives operational in 23 cells.

> So now what? I have highlighted the vulnerabilities of Riot’s system including its ability to be exploited and abused on a massive scale. Certainly Riot will deny this or outright delete my post. Your chat filter for ban baiting will not work, my friend. We know how you plan to address this “problem” as opposed to fixing the system as a whole. With this knowledge and the distributed nature of my cell and operative structure there is not anything you can do to have a meaningful impact on my actions. Mr. Riot Tantram, I do applaud your efforts and working weekends to put a stop to this. Unfortunately for you it is going to take a lot more manpower and resources to even put a dent in what I have done. You might as well redesign the system from scratch as the resources required will be on par with that. Feel free to implement your band aids. I welcome you as a worthy opponent as the gauntlet has now been droppeed.

To be fair, you have to have a very high IQ to understand human spaceflight. The science is extremely subtle, and without a solid grasp of astrodynamics most of the maneuvers will go over a typical viewer’s head. There’s also Von Braun’s nihilistic outlook, which is deftly woven into his characterisation- his personal philosophy draws heavily from Jules Verne literature, for instance. The fans understand this stuff; they have the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate the depths of these designs, to realise that they’re not just practical- they say something deep about SPACE. As a consequence people who dislike human spaceflight truly ARE idiots- of course they wouldn’t appreciate, for instance, the nuance in Buzz Aldrin’s trademark maneuver, orbital rendezvous, which itself is a cryptic reference to Kepler's Laws of Planetary Motion. I’m smirking right now just imagining one of those addlepated simpletons scratching their heads in confusion as Elon Musk’s genius wit unfolds itself on their computer screens. What fools.. how I pity them. 😂

And yes, by the way, i DO have a space tattoo. And no, you cannot see it. It’s for the ladies’ eyes only- and even then they have to demonstrate that they’re within 5 IQ points of my own (preferably lower) beforehand. Nothin personnel kid 😎

You know what kiddo? You should fucking hang yourself. It's so god damn sad when little kids think they're funny over 'clever' little comments on the internet. I can dox you, DDoS you, and make you go through hell. You seem to be asking for all three, but if you hang yourself/commit suicide I don't have to do anything. You can end your future misery, or you can sit through it. I already know what elementary school you go to, and I can hire an arab to shoot it up. I also beat your mom and dad. I know who your best friends are aswell. You're fucking dead to me kiddo. Think next time before ruining your entire life, moron.

Ayy, you're afraid, must have seen a ghostwriter
Well, dino, little bitch, but I'm not afraid to show my

Woo! You have to pretend
Ever since your little rice balls came down
Let the kids believe you did everything
When you failed to make up on the playground insults
It's bad, but then I heard you tried to rap
I was more disappointed than when I found out
Casey Neistat did not have nice tattoos
Boy, must flex
Must flex, flex, flex
Because when you have no personality
Replace it with a Rolex
You really do not see your friends rolling your eyes?
Hope they die, they are so tired
Of you throw the price of what you buy in their face
No no no no, you think they will say

"Oh my God, you are such a legend
You make me so wet with your ruthless expenses
You've got my respect and you're oh so funny
Please take me to your mansion and fuck me! "
You're really crazy
So try your best to remember
You're not a pimp
You are a cross-border sex offender
Diss boy a taste of the month
But what is it, huh?
A whiny Vietnamese wants to be gangsta
It's salty and we-nigga
You're like Kanye without talent
Like Jackie Chan but a little bassoon
Like Soulja Boy but ...
Actually, yes, you're just like Soulja Boy

Say you do not want to look like a little bitch
But boy, you will be crucified
How can you claim it?
When are you too scared to enter PewDiePie?

A little ho, little bitch
Suck my 5.3 inch cock
Realize that you were just pounded
I would say "take L" if you could pronounce it
(Get it because you're Asian?)
(That was what you wanted, right?)
(Hi, let's make fun of the Asian boy with his Asian boyish eyes)
Jesus Christ, you are as predictable as a family tour
Calling you at the surface level would be an insult to the ground floor

Whatever you promised to follow, you've stopped
You can not go on to shit, you narcissistic dot
Your audience is weak, this is what I predict
Your channel is bound to crash down to walls (oh, no!)
How the fan can anyone be called Gum
Do not realize they're in a bubble?
But let me guess, I'm irrelevant, right?
Is not that your excuse?
When you are too stupid to explain your opinions
Because you're as basic as a Rubik's Cube block
You're an unsure, unoriginal little bitch and that's it
Then come and think about it
You are actually the dog filter on Snapchat

Got money, money, money and opinions and click
And yet you're always a little bitch
Now I'm done according to plan
It was only three minutes so it was not that bad
But I had a question to ask you, bro
Did it feel good, but?

Jesus Christ
That boy askin for the penile length
Fellas can we all admit that it's ok to admire a good trap bulge every now and again?
Like
You ain't even gotta be a trapfag to look at it and think to yourself "Sweet Christmas, I'd like to do fellatio with that"
I'm talkin about that 😩 pink 🅱️oy 🕳️ hole 🕳️ that is asking 👋 to be given a good stirring 💦 🍆 with a phallic appendage 🍆 💦
And while we're at it
What life is really about is romping about in their anal cavity to stimulate their prostate which will result in an anal orgasm for said trap
Which as we ☝️ ALL ☝️ know is the cutest part of the trap's cock and balls
And benis
I did not mean to forget about that part, either
And 💯 most of all 💯 you have GOT TO
And I mean
GOT TO
You've gotta make sure that you participate in some 🔥 hot 🔥 frottage foreplay to let the little cutie pie push their cock against yours so they can feel the warmth of your manhood on theirs before you slowly get your girth inside of that 💖 precious 💖 cave of love that they have sitting tucked away between those red cheeks and placed behind that adorable, delicious cock that they are just 😍 begging 😍 to have cum erupt from as you passionately make love to them and crave every second of their boyish charm and their genuine desire to be dominated by another male
Can I get an amen?

Uhm, ok. What was the point of this comment exactly? I mean, I get it. You like his comment and agree. You realized something incredible! Mindblowing. And you want to express that. I've had those times as well... let's face it, it's a normal form of communication. But, your inane comment simply adds nothing of value to the conversation. What does this do? Does it make you feel old to be part of the team? Does it make you happy to say that you're following his thought patterns? Is this really what you want? I think you can do better, son. That's why I'm going to use the parental approach, and give you a downvote. Not because I dislike you. But because I want to teach you this very valuable lesson. Contribute to conversation - to society, my friend. Don't be a follower, be a leader. Even if it means you get downteachered as I'm fairly certain I will (but I'm brave and wise enough to comprehend the ill and negligible value of internet points, so that's irrelevant)

It's right for God to slaughter women and children anytime he pleases. God gives life and he takes life. Everybody who dies, dies because God wills that they die.

God is taking life every day. He will take 50,000 lives today. Life is in God's hand. God decides when your last heartbeat will be, and whether it ends through cancer or a bullet wound. God governs.

So God is God! He rules and governs everything. And everything he does is just and right and good. God owes us nothing.

If I were to drop dead right now, or a suicide bomber downstairs were to blow this building up and I were blown into smithereens, God would have done me no wrong. He does no wrong to anybody when he takes their life, whether at 2 weeks or at age 92.

God is not beholden to us at all. He doesn't owe us anything.

Now add to that the fact we're all sinners and deserve to die and go to hell yesterday, and the reality that we're even breathing today is sheer common grace from God.

Whoever the fuck says that you don't need cheese in your scrambled eggs is a dumb fucking uneducated inbred street shitting swine. I don't care if Gordiono Ramram doesn't say anything about cheese in your scrambled eggs, you need it, otherwise, you can't obtain perfect eggy orgasms when you shove that piping hot pile of wet yellow golden fluffy goodness into your mouth. You know- fuck butter. Fuck that shit. You don't even need the unholy artery clogging ass loads of butter like so many fake bitches say you do. Just a little is fine, just enough to coat the fucking pan. Those pseudo chefs who say you need a lot- liars. All liars. They don't know shit. They're about as educated as a rat. Actually they're probably fucking dumber than a rat. You shouldn't trust them with anything. I'm surprised some people even choose to live near people knowing that they don't put cheese in their eggs. That's like living near a suspected serial killer. Do you not value your own life? Just fuck butter. What you should be thinking about is the cheese. Saying you're gonna make scrambled eggs without cheese is like saying you're gonna taking a shit without toilet paper- you don't fucking walk around with shit smeared between your uncleaned ass cheeks and you don't god damn dare let those eggies into your esophagus without melting god the father son and holy spirit infallible slices of fucking cheese into them in the pan. But you know, so many people omit cheese anyways. It's a fucking sin. Nobody gives a shit about the sanctity of life anymore. No wonder we have Kimberly Jing Jang wanting to nuke the United States and refugees assaulting the residents of European countries and $19 trillion in debt and countries whose currency is worth less than MMO currencies and all this other shit- how can you expect human decency from anyone anywhere in the world when there are people in the world who still don't put cheese in their scrambled eggs? The answer is you can't. We are FUCKED. And it's because of STUPID FUCKS who don't put cheese in their scrambled eggs. Is it SO FUCKING DIFFICULT to respect the sanctity of life and make an effort to preserve human decency? I guess so, because I just saw you take that carton of eggs from your refrigerator without taking that package of sliced cheese too. You're just going to leave it in there, preventing it from fulfilling its destiny. Don't you know how badly it longs to be taken from the package, torn to little shreds, and scattered about in the Yellow Sea of egg whites and yolks in that pan or pot, and then melted and mixed and becoming as one with the eggs? There is no higher purpose for a slice of cheese than that. No fancy fondue or French clusterfuck can do it better service. Yet, you still refuse. GOD DAMN IT. FUCK YOU. I can't believe this. It's 2017 and there are still people like this. FUCK THEM. They deserve to burn in hellfire and brimstone. They're damning the whole human race just because they're too uncultured to put that godsend coagulated milk protein into their eggs.  People are FUCKING DUMB and they ruin everything. Kimberly Jing Jang just fucking nuke everyone already. We don't deserve to exist when part of our species is so primitive and intellectually disabled. We should all just die. We don't deserve to breathe another breath of air. Just please, right now, cook up some scrambled eggs and put some cheese in them. You will become enlightened almost beyond your own feeble human comprehension. You will see the truth- your wrongs, your mistakes, your reflections and retrospects on life- you will gain lifetimes and lifetimes worth of insight, experience, and wisdom, things that not even the most ambitious scientists or philosophers could attain. You can transcend your shitty, sinful existence just by putting cheese in your eggs. There is no need to cure disease or end wars or invent new technologies- all of those will come, in shining, beautiful waves of discovery- just by putting cheese in your eggs. Do it bitch. Your stubbornness is holding back the entirety of humanity.

 Ok, I'll just say this, and I know it's gonna make no sense to some people: The fact that people think a fanbase is cancerous is not because of the fanbase, or the things they have done, it's actually because of the spark itself that created its downfall in the first place. A lot of good games have been destroyed because one or more big people in the entertainment business brang their fanbase into the game's. This causes a merge that quickly begins to break down the fanbase's structure and wholesomeness. Undertale was a pretty good fanbase until the public was interested in it because of watching videos about it. Most fanbases that are still standing as decent and wholesome are the one's that people have played for themselves, and can understand the moral of the game's stories and whatnot. "Cancerous" fanbases tend to be classified as that because it gets swarmed by people who haven't even played the game before in the first place, and they just assume that the video is what it is.

"Rick and Morty"? Only a plebeian worm such as yourself would engage in viewing broadcasts of such a sad and idiotic show. Unlike you low IQ apes, I please my optical sensors with only the finest of entertainment. I'll bet that you're inquiring as to what source of entertainment I am referring to. Although I don't expect you to comprehend it, the television show in question is "Young Sheldon". You see, the humor is vastly superior to that of "Rick and Morty". First of all "Rick and Morty" relies heavily on improvisional comedy, while the intellectual humor of "Young Sheldon" is scripted and well thought out before being presented to an audience. Second of all "Rick and Morty" is extremely unfaithful to its source material (Back to the Future, for you simpletons) while "Young Sheldon" is just as good if not better than watching "The Big Bang Theory". I could go on and on about how "Rick and Morty" is vastly inferior to "Young Sheldon" but I highly doubt that you have the mental capability to process such logic. So if you'll excuse me, I'm going to pour a glass of brandy whilst I redigest the latest episode of "Young Sheldon" so I can make an entry about it to the "Young Sheldon" wikia. Hopefully, I can forget about ever having the displeasure of interacting with you.*Sighs... How tedious.

When I found out there would be a level inspired by Latin America I was thrilled. The closer I pay attention to the details in it I find many examples of racism ranging micro-aggressions to full blown stereotyping. What prompted me to notice these was fighting the second boss for Tostarena. You literally destroy one of their gods for a multi moon. Forget that he has every right to be upset about his ring being stolen your the strong Caucasian explorer and you take what you want from whoever. After feeling in my gut that this wasn’t right I started noticing other things packed in. Notice how every other crazy cap store has either an open layout or a counter you can easily go over? In the Tostarena one you can’t get back there and the only way to get in is through a busted hole in some bars. They’re litterally being forced to work their for the Caucasian run Crazy Cap store. There are also some weird add on in the tourist menu. The first is that it says many of their attractions have become over run combat zones? Like for real Latin America is a wonderful place to visit and not everything is some episode of Narcos so why characterize the Latin level as a war zone? Secondly and this one was sneaky but before you release the moons from the moon stone there are sixty-nine moons. Seems innocuous right? Except for the fact that it implies Latin women are promiscuous through there being 69 moons as in Luna. Why the mischaracterization of Latin woman? You can say well it changes after you release the moons but thatbjust implies that Latin men are lazy, never finish anything, and only care for again promiscuous Latin women instead of finishing the game. There are many examples of them lazing around the level neglecting their duties. The Tostarena are also the only people in the game that gamble as well symbolizing that they can’t make honest money. Why do the Japanese view Latin people this way? It’s very disconcerting and I hate it. What have you noticed in Tostarena that is tasteless?

Each time I see a beautiful woman in the street it makes me so sad because I think about my own loneliness, that I can't get a girlfriend and never did. It’s not right, males are the one commiting all the crimes yet these women still want to associate with them and don’t ever want to be with a woman. I think it should be natural for women NOT to be attracted to apey mutants, aka males, but mainly because of patriarchal socializations many are and that's the reason why i can't get a girlfriend despite being above average in intelligence, emancipated, well off and able bodied, and, unlike 100% of males, I would never be violent with my significant other. I’m fighting for our freedom and girls of my generation just don’t get it. And those of the other generation don’t get it either. Males are mutants, for the Y chromosome is a mutation of the X chromosome. That's a fact. They also act like parasites and robots with their reproduction. More precisely like viruses. A virus hijack a cell, copies it’s dna into it and use it to reproduce. Does that ring a bell? THATS EXACTLY WHANT MEN DO. Only women can love or make love, males are just trying to take a genetical dump. We have very different genes from males. They are closer to a chimp than we are from them. When a woman breeds with a male, it’s no different from bestiality, since we practically are different species, and males being closer to animals than from us. A male fucking a chimpanzee or a gorilla is less of bestiality than a man having sex with a woman. But right now, monkeys are running the zoo.

This is going to open up a whole floodgate of questions.
*Puts on weeb glasses*
If the vagina is functional, does that mean that the entire reproductive system of the clone is functional, including the uterus? Does that mean that the clone can get pregnant? If so, can the clone change back into male Naruto and would he still be pregnant? Would he have to stay as female Naruto and carry it to term or abort before he can change back? What happens if the clone disappears? The anime established that the original Naruto gains the memories and experiences of the clone, so does that mean that the fetus gets absorbed by the original?
So many unanswered questions. . .

People are not exclusive to perverted thoughts. Sure, I've always thought about sex with other people, most of the time it's very taboo. Sometimes it's very brutal and honestly, I feel like I need to see a psychiatrist.

But it's not just people.

A few times in my life, I've thought about ejaculating into a shot glass to see how much I could fill it up. One day, I decided to live that dream. To my surprise, I was able to over fill the glass. I had to grab another shot glass and scrape the remaining cum into it.

With no one to share it with, I took the shots myself. Wasn't sour, a bit tasteless honestly. It was just a bit bitter was all. It's definitely exaggerated on how bad it is. I'm not saying *'Go drink your own cum,'* but it wouldn't be a bad first time experience.

A bit of spit and rinse was all that was needed to clean it. Went back to my bartending duties afterwords.

Why are there age limits? why is it illegal to marry a 12-year old? Helen of Troy was 12. Juliet and Cleopatra were still teenagers when they became famous. Most heroines of classic novels and poems were underage by today's laws. Thomas Edison married a 16-year-old. Medical studies show that the best age for a woman to have children is between 15 and 25 (lowest chances of miscarriage, of birth defects and, last but not least, of the woman dying while giving birth); while the worst age is after the mid 30s. And the younger you are, the more likely you are to cement a real friendship with your children; the older you are, the more likely that the "generational gap" will hurt your children's psychology. Therefore it is much more natural to have a child at 16 than at 40. In countless countries of the world women have their first child at a very young age, and stop having children at a relatively young age. Nonetheless, in the USA it is illegal to have sex before 18 (but, note, only if the partner is over 18, which is like saying that it is ok to rob a bank if you are a banker), while it is perfectly legal to get pregnant at 40 or (thanks to medical progress) even at 70.

Great job, just one

People are not hot, no hot

Skrott, Skidi-Kat-Kat

Boom

Two two plus two are four, one of these three quick calculations

Every day in the cushion, smoke

Look for your daughter in the garden, the girl is an injection

When the band closes, you have sucked luck (you suck it)

Keep a drug, Asznee (my brudda), thinks the pink (bigger)

Hold up, my husband (my husband), he found the snow

I'm going to stick to it, depending on the phone, and I'm smiling with wheat

Rice Krispies, my Whitney pie (My G)

On the road ten rows, like my feet (like my feet)

A man thinks I'm frozen, I see a pink girl, then I'm chilin.

If not, I would, yes, look at your nose (check your nose, fami)

Prepare, the tissue looks like the garden tube

[Chorus]

I tell her uncle, I tell her husband that I'm not hot

The girl told me, "Stop your jacket"

I said, "Babes, man is not hot" (no hot)

I tell her warm-tempered husband (no hot)

I tell her warm-tempered husband (no hot)

The girl told me, "Stop your jacket"

I said, "Babes, man is not hot" (no hot)

You know how the world will end. 
First Russia will invade America through the wintery wilderness of Alaska. Through this death and destruction, many refugees will be displaced and will move to Britain. The ensuing war would be the last straw for humanity, who will start an official world government with sovereign power. This world government (or United Nation) would solve many world problems and would be ruled by the current seven permanent nations of the UN. One of the refugees from the now occupied America would move to Britain and unite the various African and third world countries into an independent league. This league would rise against the UN and would be allowed to rule with the other seven head members as one United Nation State. One day a young man would rise through the ranks and become De Facto dictator of the UN. During this time the Temple in Jerusalem will be restored and a period of lasting peace and unity will ensue. This however is when the end begins. This dictator will defile the temple of Jerusalem in such a terrible way it will cause a world wide shock. The dictator will use his power to ban most forms of religion and tracking chip will be distributed to keep track. They will be disguised as a new form of credit cards. Anyone religious practice will be punished by death and the world will live under an oppressive dictatorship, but two young men will continually defy the government, preaching and distributing religious texts illegally. These two men continually avoid death and capture until one day, on a worldwide forecast they are executed. A large nuclear war will break out due to racial and religious tensions between the nation sates of the UN. This war will end with an antimatter bomb, unleashing a nuclear winter on most of the world as the Mediterranean ocean is poisoned with matter.

DO NOT SUPPORT CYBERNETIC ROBOTIC  PROSTHETIC LIMBS!!!
Cybernetic robotic prosthetic limbs are the technological spear-point in the War to Make Us Eat Our Own Human Limbs.
This vast global conspiracy seeks to rid us of our own human limbs, firstly by driving us into starvation via socialism and then to enslave us to their robotic limb economy!
Once all of our currency is devalued, we will eat our own arms and legs (after we’ve consumed all the dogs and cats). In our weak and limbless condition we will gladly accept their cybernetic robotic prosthetic limbs in place of our own lost human limbs. But these limbs will come at a heavy price!!! In order to pay for them we will all be forced to work at the robotic limbs factories.
Like mindless machines, we will use our robotic limbs to create more robotic limbs for others who are forced to eat their own arms and legs.
DO NOT LET THEM WIN. DO NOT GO GENTLY AND LIMBLESSLY INTO THE NIGHT.
Reject the globalist agenda to make us eat our own arms and legs and replace them with robotic cybernetic prosthetic limbs.

Look, look. Here it is. All I want to do is be able to have that open conversation. It was all an exploitation tactic. It literally spun the world — your guy's world — it spun it into a frenzy and proved exactly what I thought it would do in terms of how all this works. It created a division, or, literally stand up there and let all these people threw tomatoes at me, or have somebody think I'm somehow a different intellectual person because I believe that the Earth is flat and you think the world is round. It created exactly that.

Hey, NE0-ST3NCHLORD
You smell like a fucking swamp. How’s the yogscast gonna help you when your steampunk cosplay wilts under your RedPill Female Repellent. How much dignity do you have to lack to watch a real life 30 year old man laugh for half an hour dick in hand. I hope your stinky gf who makes anime drawings using the pencil tool in photoshop takes back all the points she gifted you on deviantart to make you send her your Solo Male Humiliation JO vids on xhamster. You were thinking about unprivating them but she made you promise not to. I know you only talk to online tutors for Engineering because you like to laugh at their sheepish behavior but no matter how many Gary Vaynerchuk videos you watch you’ll never be a self made man. Like sand in the ocean your skin has been worn down by years of leathery crumby stench. That thin skin won’t make it in the real world like the NEETS on /r/MGTOW say. I know you. I know who you are. You look at /r/incel as a joke and more often then you would like you realize you agree with what they say.

 Your stink is a small price to pay for the CYBER-RETRIBUTION females get when you comment on feminist tumblr posts. You spend your time in the depths of 4chan and secretly like pewdiepie. What started as an ironic watch turned into a full on fandom. You buy pewdiepie shirts on redbubble, brofisting your friends and you smile every time you watch a 2011-era pewdiepie Epic Halloween Screamfest wishing secretly he and yogscast would do a crossover video. Remember that time you thought that girl that sits next to you in Biology said a pewdiepie quote, and you listened intently every day after to check if she mentioned it ever again. Yeah. Her username is MoonPaw3323 and she animates her pencil drawings of horses with windows movie maker subtitles telling a story of angels and demons. You missed your chance. Maybe if you weren’t so busy switching between joking about and almost buying an oppai mousepad you would’ve had a chance.

Why me, why do you always want to break us down. You wanna say something, say it to my face not some random ass you trust who's supposedly your friend. Wanna talk shit about the lgbt go ahead as long as it doesnt involve religion, the bible, and just stupid reasons. I'm sick of it, it makes you look like an idiot. You think you're superior, think of it this way you're eating candy with your friends but they give you something you dont like. Therefore, you would say no thanks i dont like it, right? You dont have to be a pain by saying stupid reasons. You don't know how people struggle. Im tired of people saying "oh he's gay" or "omg that's so gay". If you don't like it say you don't like it dont say gay as an insult its like making fun of your loved one who has cancer or even autism. It's serious, not a fucking game to joke about. Plus why would my body matter to you anyway. Im trans so what. I have a good looking body? Ok that's your opinion but dont force me to like my body. Dont make me be you, i don't care if you think im pretty as a girl, or pretty with straight hair or a dress. It's not me if you don't like it ok but you don't have to be an ass.

So I'm just at lunch enjoying my Imo's and bosco sticks and Dr. Oz comes on talking about electronic cigarettes! "Great, he's going to tell people about the how great they are for smokers trying to quit".... Or so I thought. He goes on about how dangerous and how little research there is on them. According to him, there is diethyline glycol in the juice. BULLSHIT! If he's confusing this with **Propyline Glycol** then he's still a fucking idiot. PG is used in tons of foods as a stabilizer to keep foods moist. Oh and the FDA deems it **SAFE FOR HUMAN CONSUMPTION!!!** He also says that PG is in antifreeze... Ok this is true. **BUT,** this is a scare tactic because he fails to mention that it is used in **non-toxic antifreeze!** What is the asshole doing trying to ruin something good in the eyes of millions people?!

This happened many many years ago. At a bbq/party me and my friends aren't nudity adverse so when the party dwindled down to about 4 or 5 couples we hit the hot tub sans suits. At some point the girls got out to go get more drinks or the group bathroom run not sure, so it's us dudes alone in the hot tub and the marines in the tub start going into gross out deployment stories.

One guy gets into how they give each other "the brains". Which is just pulling your sac out through your pants so it's a scrunched up and wrinkly looking and having someone turn around into that. One of the other guys in the tub can not wrap his head around this so the marine stands up to demonstrate. Since we were naked in the hot tub warm water the balls are hanging low, in the process to perform this demonstration he retracted his balls. Cue minds blown. A couple of the dudes in the tub couldn't do this apparently didn't know it was possible to voluntarily move your balls up and down. So those that can are trying to teach those that can't how to voluntary retract thier balls. And that's when the girls came back to the hot tub with us standing around the outside of the hot tub, dicks in hand, half squatting, and shouting retract release retract release. Needless to say we kicked the notches out and proceeded to suck each others dicks. No homo.

I live in Southern California, and I have happened yo move a lot, and in every single town that I have lived in. My family always goes to Souplantation every now and then, and it always ends up the same. So, as soon as you walk through that door, you immediately go to a salad bar, and I'm a picky eater(wont even have ketchup on anything) and I don't like soup, so I don't get anything. Then you get to the actual buffet part, you may think,'Oh, a buffet? those are always good' NOT TODAY!! Normal buffets have items like, French Fries, Mashed Potatoes, and Meat, and lots of it, and it's always a 10. Souplantation has soup, cheezy bread, or as my little sister says,'It's pizza!' NO! IT IS CHEESE ON BREAD, NO PIZZA!!! and Souplantation also has baked potatoes. I have never seen meat there, and meat is my favorite food!
And another thing, it is friggin' pretentious as HECK, THERE IS NO GOOD FOOD THERE!!! WHILE OTHER BUFFETS HAVE MANY TENS, THIS BUFFET, ONLY HAS ONE EIGHT THAT TAKES 15 MINUTES TO MAKE, AND YOU DO MOST OF THE WORK!!! I LIKE RESTAURANTS BECAUSE I DON'T HAVE TO MAKE MYSELF A BOWL OF CEREAL BECAUSE I HAVE NO IDEA HOW TO COOK AT ALL AND I WANT SOME FREAKING MEAT!!! BUFFETS ARE THE LEAST AMOUNT OF WORK THAT YOU HAVE TO DO FOR FOOD, BUT AT THIS RETARDED PLACE, IF YOU WANT SOMETHING DECENT, YOU GOT TO WAIT 15 MINUTES OF PREPARING YOUR MASHED POTATO, WHILE MOST BUFFETS HAVE BOTH MASHED AND BAKED POTATOES!!! Well, making this review has made me kind of hungry, for MEAT!!! So, if Souplantation ever reads this, SOUPLANTATION GET OFF OF YOUR DAMN BUTT AND MAKE MASHED POTATO AS A CHOICE, I DON'T WANT TO HAVE TO SPEND 15 MINUTES MAKING THE PERFECT POTATO, WHEN I COULD JUST DO THAT AT HOME!!!

As a twenty one pilot fan from back when there were 3 members and they were essentially unknown, making happy wheels youtube videos on their "slushy guys" channel with like 300 subscribers(insert hipster remark here) I suggest to people, look at their music, especially some of their older songs, and dont let the current fangirl fanbase bias your opinion when listening. If you actually listen to the lyrics and analyze them, their music really stands out because of the fusion of such deep philisophical narratives and alagorical stories told during the songs. (note that their songs are generally in th context of a man struggling with God when listening)Im not saying every lyric I agree with, and ive always thought that their musical composition was hit or miss. Sometimes the beats sound amature, and sometimes it feels genius. I always let them slide with that though because at the time they were just amature unknown musicians. In other words theyre not perfect and could use a lot of improvement. Lyrically is where they shine, musically its so-so. When they blew up they gained all these fangirls though, and now I believe they will probably start having to cater their music to them since they are the majority. But we'll see. If I hadnt heard of TOP until the point they were overplayed on the radio with a fangirl fanbase, id probably discount them as some wanna be deep or edgy group, just like im sure many of you have. But in reality(especially their older songs, and tylers songs that havent been put on albums) they are pretty real guys with lyrics that ask important questions. So id consider giving them a chance past the shallow layer thats seen through the fanbase.﻿

My roommate in college starting drinking again when bush was re-elected. She was 11 years sober and fell off the wagon. She stayed in her room for two weeks, consuming nothing but tacitos from Costco and beer. She got really really constipated and once everything started flowing again, she took the biggest shit I have ever seen. It was so big it clogged the toilet. She paid me $100 to unclog it.

I unbolted it from the floor and took it outside, blasting it with a hose and attacking it with a metal clothes hanger. It was dense, like really thick mud. After 90 min I was not making any progress. I gave up and bought a new toilet with the $100.

The old toilet I broke apart with a hammer and then put the pieces in the trash can, the shit was like cement at this point. I have no idea how it came out of a human body.

It kinda put me off eating tacitos for a bit tbh

Not to sound condescending, but three sentences into your comment I have already detected the vast incoherence in your reasoning. I therefore logically conclude that your intellect is NOT so impressive as you might have made it appear to be. To begin with, no, you do NOT understand theoretical physics. It's been a while since I did Quantum mechanics, for that is not my field of interest (which is, of course, string theory😎). However, the gist of it I still remember; your comment implies a deep misunderstanding of Quantum physics. I'm smirking right now, not because I approve of your stupidity, but because through my intelligence I have explained the entire world with science, and in this meaningless world we can only laugh at it; I can only laugh at the absurdity your words emanates and the pain of being misinterpreted by the world.

Sorry I just diverted from my argument, which I personally see no problem with by reason of my exceptional intellect -- it might be difficult to follow my writing for one with an IQ, hmmm... 10 pts below mine. Anyways, the epistemology you proposed, of combining the bleakness of Rick's nihilistic outlook with the warmth of Twilight Sparkle's emphasis on friendship, is simply WRONG. Rick cannot possibly approve of Twilight Sparkle's worship of magic. I believe, on the other hand, that it is possible to the philosophy of Pinkie Pie a shot.

To be fair, you have to have a very high IQ to understand Harambe. The humour is extremely subtle, and without a solid grasp of zoology most of the jokes will go over a typical viewer’s head. There’s also Harambes tragic death, which is deftly woven into his characterisation- his personal philosophy draws heavily from leafyishere. The fans understand this stuff; they have the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate the depths of these jokes, to realise that they’re not just funny- they say something deep about LIFE. As a consequence people who dislike Harambe truly ARE idiots- of course they wouldn’t appreciate, for instance, the humour in dicks out for Harambe which itself is a cryptic reference to my name jeff meme compilations. I’m smirking right now just imagining one of those addlepated simpletons scratching their heads in confusion as Harambe's genius wit unfolds itself on their subboxes. What fools.. how I pity them. 😂

George Lucas is often criticised for ruining the Star Wars franchise with the prequels. It may be a popular opinion but these so called ‘fans’ who hate the prequels are clearly incapable of seeing George Lucas’s artistic vision for what it really is; a masterpiece. 

Here is why the Phantom Menace is the greatest Star Wars movie to ever grace our cinema screens:

From the start of the movie it is immediately made clear that the galaxy is in grave danger. As the epic opening crawl appears on the screen, one can’t help but shudder with excitement and anticipation as the thoughts of what horrors await the Jedi Knights in their trade negotiations fill your mind. The so called ‘fans’ of the original trilogy say that these trade negotiations are dull and boring. What these idiots don’t realise is that if the trade negotiations were to fail then the galactic economy could enter an enervating recession which could be exploited by the Sith. With no free trade, star systems won’t be able to benefit from absolute advantage meaning that the output of the entire galactic economy decreases. This means that the price of almost every good in the galaxy increases. Just think about how expensive lightsabers must be; that shit doesn’t come cheap. If these trade negotiations weren’t treated seriously then the movie wouldn’t have any credible threat meaning it would just end up like A New Hope because the Death Star definitely wasn’t a credible threat. The Empire couldn’t even build it properly as Luke destroyed it with his eyes closed. Just think about that for a second, the weapon of mass destruction that the Empire thought would bring the galaxy to it’s knees, can be destroyed by a blind man.

All good movies need good characters. In the Phantom Menace the best character is without a doubt Jar-Jar Binks. The humour in his character is easily missed as many ‘fans’ call him childish and annoying but they lack the intellectual depth to understand the genius of the subtle humour crafted into his character. 

The plot; which is built upon by the later prequels is simply sublime. The way Palpatine manipulates the senate into granting him emergency powers shows how cunning he was as an individual. Never was it obvious that he would turn out to be the emperor, pulling the strings of the various factions in the galaxy to give him the authority to build his new dictatorship. This obviously creates a great deal of tension for that big reveal in Revenge of the Sith, that had me jerking off at the thought; that I was one of the few with the wit to see Sheev for who he really was.

I know I am going to get a lot of hate for this opinion  but I hope that some people have the sense to the see the Phantom Menace as I do. Hopefully in time those who call themselves ‘fans’ will be worthy of that title but until then they can go fuck themselves.

Here's the thing. You said a "shemale is a futanari."

Is it in the same family? Yes. No one's arguing that.

As someone who is a scientist who studies futanari, I am telling you, specifically, in science, no one calls shemales futanari. If you want to be "specific" like you said, then you shouldn't either. They're not the same thing.

If you're saying "hermaphroditic family" you're referring to the taxonomic grouping of "Futanarae", which includes things from crossdressers to lady boys to He-Shes.

So your reasoning for calling a shemale a futanari is because random people "call the ones with dicks futanari?" Let's get trannies and powerbottoms in there, then, too.

Also, calling someone a human or an ape? It's not one or the other, that's not how taxonomy works. They're both. A shemale is a shemale and a member of the futanari family. But that's not what you said. You said a shemale is a futanari, which is not true unless you're okay with calling all members of the futanari family futanaris, which means you'd call lady boys, trannies, and other chicks with dicks futanari, too. Which you said you don't.

It's okay to just admit you're wrong, you know?

Jotaro Kujo is a character with a lot of depth hidden behind a calm and collected personality, with the only outlet for his emotions being violent bursts of rage. After having his dad abandon him at a young age he must not have had the most stable of households, not to mention the events that led to him becoming such a delinquent. Then there's the fact that he believed he was being possessed by an evil spirit, scaring him enough to literally say that he would rather be in prison so that nobody else got hurt by it. After finding out that it was actually a stand he was cast into a life or death situation to save his mother, literally the only person he's had in his life, because some asshole named DIO that had killed his great great grandfather has come back and is basically going to kill his mom unless he travels all the way to Egypt from fucking Japan and kills the vampiric son of a bitch all in under fifty days. So he's forced to go on a journey with the grandfather that was never around, some random egyptian guy, a french weirdo with no eyebrows that has more screentime than he, the main character, does, and the one person his own age he's actually able to get along with. On the way to Egypt they encounter a fuck ton of other stand users, including one that could literally replicate the heat of the fucking sun, all so that they can make it to Egypt and fight EVEN MORE stand users, all while keeping his cool. Only after his only friend dies and his grandfather gets stabbed in the throat right in front of them does he actually get a little visibly pissed. THEN he has to fight a vampire with incredible regeneration abilities and the power TO FUCKING STOP TIME FOR LIKE 10 SECONDS while he can react for like 2. After somehow actually beating him, he's forced to live a life with PTSD and the inability to keep a steady relationship, stating that he married his wife because she was low maintanence and that he didn't want to be around his daughter so that he could protect her from the dangers of life that he faced every day.

Do any of you guys have a cheat day for hentai? Like a day maybe once every one or two weeks where you whack it to a real chick instead of anime?

I started doing it a few months ago and I think it's starting to become a problem. It used to be that I had NO cheat days and my diet consisted only of hentai. I couldn't even get hard unless I was staring at a 14 year old cartoon character with giant bazongas. 

But ever since I started the cheat days, I've noticed I've been gravitating more and more towards irl porn. It's gone from once every other week to 3 times a week. Is there something wrong with me? I stopped watching anything with live female actresses and I cut off contact with all girls irl (except my mother, of course). But i think that may have made me even MORE desperate to jack off to them. I really need some advice, here, how do I go back to my old hentai lifestyle?

To be fair, you have to have a very advanced knowledge of combat strategy to excel in PlayerUnknown’s Battlegrounds. The tactics required to consistently win matches are extremely subtle, and without a solid grasp of modern infantry SOP most matches will leave a typical player wishing they were still playing Call Of Duty. There’s also Brendan “PlayerUnknown” Greene’s pacifist outlook, which is deftly woven into the gaming experience he created - his personal philosophy draws heavily from Leo Tolstoy literature, for instance. The players understand this stuff; they have the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate the depths of the game, to relise that it’s not just fun - it says something deep about LIFE. As a consequence people who dislike PlayerUnknown’s Battlegrounds truly AREidiots- of course they wouldn’t appreciate, for instance, the deeper meanings in PlayerUnknown’s necessity to carry a frying pan. The frying pan which itself is a cryptic reference to watching each other’s back in combat, and the importance of having rear protection even in a solo operation. I’m smirking right now just imagining one of those addlepated simpletons scratching their heads in confusion as PlayerUnknown’s genius vaulting mechanics unfold  on their computer monitors. What fools.. how I pity them. 😂

And yes, by the way, i DO have a frying pan tattoo on my gluteal. And no, you cannot see it. It’s for the ladies’ eyes only- and even then they have to demonstrate that they’re within 5 winning matches of my own record (preferably lower) beforehand. Nothin personnel kid 😎

I was just a wee lad when i had my first cummie, my papa had called me to his study, so I came as any other good boy would do. Into the room I ventured and as I stepped into the door I was captured by a sight most unusual, there he was, my father, stroking his magnificent cock with both his hands gripping around the shaft. I remember ever detail from the smallest pewb to the most prominent vein he told me to step forward so I did as I was told and grew closer he started to stroke harder as I came closer, with each step he stroked hard than the last until I got close enough to smell the smegma he told me to touch it (it being absurdly large wonder cock) so I did as any other obedient child would do, just as I touch the tip his cum came protruding up like a apollo 13 speeding into space at mach 20 for the first and though most of it went in my eye (don't worry I arrrggged)I did get small but magnificent taste of daddy's cummies.

Calm down my young friend. K , this little, underwhelming in form, but overwhelming in effect, letter is misunderstood by many. I use it not because I want you to feel not heard, but merely because I lack the time and writing experience to  exchange my feelings via textual form with you... I only give such answers because I believe the real "dialogue" takes place via speaking, in our case via video transmission.

It should be noted that I've upvoted every single person who's disagreed with me here, as far as I know.

That said.

In 7th grade, I took an SAT test without preparing for it at all, it was spur-of-the-moment, I knew about it about an hour ahead of time and didn't do any research or anything. I scored higher on it than the average person using it to apply for college in my area.

An IQ test has shown me to be in the 99.9th percentile for IQ. This is the highest result the test I was given reaches; anything further and they'd consider it to be within the margin of error for that test.

My mother's boyfriend of 8 years is an aerospace engineer who graduated Virginia Tech. At the age of 15, I understand physics better than him, and I owe very little of it to him, as he would rarely give me a decent explanation of anything, just tell me that my ideas were wrong and become aggravated with me for not quite understanding thermodynamics. He's not particularly successful as an engineer, but I've met lots of other engineers who aren't as good as me at physics, so I'm guessing that's not just a result of him being bad at it.

I'm also pretty good at engineering. I don't have a degree, and other than physics I don't have a better understanding of any aspect of engineering than any actual engineer, but I have lots of ingenuity for inventing new things. For example, I independently invented regenerative brakes before finding out what they were, and I was only seven or eight years old when I started inventing wireless electricity solutions (my first idea being to use a powerful infrared laser to transmit energy; admittedly not the best plan).

I have independently thought of basically every branch of philosophy I've come across. Every question of existentialism which I've seen discussed in SMBC or xkcd or Reddit or anywhere else, the thoughts haven't been new to me. Philosophy has pretty much gotten trivial for me; I've considered taking a philosophy course just to see how easy it is.

Psychology, I actually understand better than people with degrees. Unlike engineering, there's no aspect of psychology which I don't have a very good understanding of. I can debunk many of even Sigmund Freud's theories.

I'm a good enough writer that I'm writing a book and so far everybody who's read any of it has said it was really good and plausible to expect to have published. And that's not just, like, me and family members, that counts strangers on the Internet. I've heard zero negative appraisal of it so far; people have critiqued it, but not insulted it.

I don't know if that will suffice as evidence that I'm intelligent. I'm done with it, though, because I'd rather defend my maturity, since it's what you've spent the most time attacking. The following are some examples of my morals and ethical code.

I believe firmly that everybody deserves a future. If we were to capture Hitler at the end of WWII, I would be against executing him. In fact, if we had any way of rehabilitating him and knowing that he wasn't just faking it, I'd even support the concept of letting him go free. This is essentially because I think that whoever you are in the present is a separate entity from who you were in the past and who you are in the future, and while your present self should take responsibility for your past self's actions, it shouldn't be punished for them simply for the sake of punishment, especially if the present self regrets the actions of the past self and feels genuine guilt about them.

I don't believe in judgement of people based on their personal choices as long as those personal choices aren't harming others. I don't have any issue with any type of sexuality whatsoever (short of physically acting out necrophilia, pedophilia, or other acts which have a harmful affect on others - but I don't care what a person's fantasies consist of, as long as they recognize the difference between reality and fiction and can separate them). I don't have any issue with anybody over what type of music they listen to, or clothes they wear, etc. I know that's not really an impressive moral, but it's unfortunately rare; a great many people, especially those my age, are judgmental about these things.

I love everyone, even people I hate. I wish my worst enemies good fortune and happiness. Rick Perry is a vile, piece of shit human being, deserving of zero respect, but I wish for him to change for the better and live the best life possible. I wish this for everyone.

I'm pretty much a pacifist. I've taken a broken nose without fighting back or seeking retribution, because the guy stopped punching after that. The only time I'll fight back is if 1) the person attacking me shows no signs of stopping and 2) if I don't attack, I'll come out worse than the other person will if I do. In other words, if fighting someone is going to end up being more harmful to them than just letting them go will be to me, I don't fight back. I've therefore never had a reason to fight back against anyone in anything serious, because my ability to take pain has so far made it so that I'm never in a situation where I'll be worse off after a fight. If I'm not going to get any hospitalizing injuries, I really don't care.

The only exception is if someone is going after my life. Even then, I'll do the minimum amount of harm to them that I possibly can in protecting myself. If someone points a gun at me and I can get out of it without harming them, I'd prefer to do that over killing them.

I consider myself a feminist. I don't believe in enforced or uniform gender roles; they may happen naturally, but they should never be coerced into happening unnaturally. As in, the societal pressure for gender roles should really go, even if it'll turn out that the majority of relationships continue operating the same way of their own accord. I treat women with the same outlook I treat men, and never participate in the old Reddit "women are crazy" circlejerk, because there are multiple women out there and each have different personalities just like there are multiple men out there and each with different personalities. I don't think you do much of anything except scare off the awesome women out there by going on and on about the ones who aren't awesome.

That doesn't mean I look for places to victimize women, I just don't believe it's fair to make generalizations such as the one about women acting like everything's OK when it's really not (and that's a particularly harsh example, because all humans do that).

I'm kind of tired of citing these examples and I'm guessing you're getting tired of reading them, if you've even made it this far. In closing, the people who know me in real life all respect me, as do a great many people in the Reddit brony community, where I spend most of my time and where I'm pretty known for being helpful around the community. A lot of people in my segment of the community are depressed or going through hard times, and I spend a lot of time giving advice and support to people there. Yesterday someone quoted a case of me doing this in a post asking everyone what their favorite motivational/inspirational quote was, and that comment was second to the top, so I guess other people agreed (though, granted, it was a pretty low-traffic post, only about a dozen competing comments).

And, uh, I'm a pretty good moderator.

All that, and I think your behavior in this thread was totally assholish. So what do you think, now that you at least slightly know me?

For those people who say this song is bad, please take a moment to listen to my argument.

This song to normal people might seem bad, but if you listen closely, you can actually tell that the notes and vocals used in this song is actually very unique and intricate. As a professional musician, I am capable of seeing that. This song actually breaks the law of music theory, and that might sound bad to you, but it's said that it can only be done by a genius. The drums have a subtle ting to it, and the chords are even able to give people shivers of pure satisfaction. The way the wave of the synths moves is just simply incredible.

According to history, Mozart once actually said that he had tried to make a song with these notes before, but he eventually gave up after trying countless times as it was too hard for his mind to comprehend. However, we can clearly see that this, this artist who made this song, is simply a genius.﻿

I swear to the Almighty Lord and Saviour Jesus H.W. Allah Christ, Sr., morals are just flying out the windows these days. What is it with Redditors' propensity to constantly make dirty jokes? Do you really think it's funny when an innocent child's eyes get molested by such shameful marks of pedantry?

My son just came to me crying because these jokes confused the poor boy. Maybe I'm a poor parent and just haven't exposed him to enough things over the past 32 years of his life, but I still lay much of the responsibility on the producers of content and comments here: the Redditors themselves.

Now, I'm sure you're all plenty nice person outside of this context - and it's true, most of us make off-color jokes - but sometimes it just crosses the line. This is one of those times.

Greetings to all people of mdva. I know some of you out there have confusing opinions about me. I can tell you what I do intend on doing. I will open my business called mega corporation but it will be called mega corp for short. My goal with this corporation is to hold gaming tournaments and sell the merchandise needed to play them. I also intend on strategy games to be played competitively at my business. Games that are trading card games or board games fall into this category. Of course smash 4 and melee will be at the store I intend on building. Project M also will have a place. I also intend on making the games that are played in my business streamed so others around the world can see. I intend on out doing certain businesses in mdva so mega corp becomes the main option of this region for tournaments of all kinds for games. I intend on making my business a chain that will spread around the world. I will make a team with different ideas that can be used in another region where it would see more success. Ronald mcdonald is a past figure that I truly admire. He made his business a thing all over the world by building a team with people that have unique business ideas. Once my business is all over the world, my goal would be to find the true king of games of that time. I understand if all of you think I'm crazy thinking this big at my age.

Holy shit. My mom came into my room to bring me a plate of chicken nuggets and I literally screamed at her and hit the plate of chicken nuggets out of her hand. She started yelling and swearing at me and I slammed the door on her. I’m so distressed right now I don’t know what to do. I didn’t mean to do that to my mom but I’m literally in shock from the earnings call tonight. I feel like I’m going to explode. Why the fucking fuck is TSLA down? This can’t be happening. I’m having a fucking breakdown. I don’t want to believe the world is so corrupt. I want a future to believe in. I want Elon to be president and fix this broken country.

People are not exclusive to perverted thoughts. Sure, I've always thought about sex with other people, most of the time it's very taboo. Sometimes it's very brutal and honestly, I feel like I need to see a psychiatrist.

But it's not just people.

A few times in my life, I've thought about ejaculating into a shot glass to see how much I could fill it up. One day, I decided to live that dream. To my surprise, I was able to over fill the glass. I had to grab another shot glass and scrape the remaining cum into it.
With no one to share it with, I took the shots myself. Wasn't sour, a bit tasteless honestly. It was just a bit bitter was all. It's definitely exaggerated on how bad it is. I'm not saying 'Go drink your own cum,' but it wouldn't be a bad first time experience.
A bit of spit and rinse was all that was needed to clean it. Went back to my bartending duties afterwards.

I’m not sure if I can continue to keep up with the intelligence level required to appreciate these memes. Unfortunately, I have not watched all of the episodes of the renowned T.V. show, “Richard and Mortimer.” Therefore, I was never exposed to such levels of theoretical physics.

So today in Spanish class, my teacher told us that we would be listening to a song in Spanish. Already, I began to tremble. I had a bad feeling about this. “Which one?” I ask shakily, not wanting to hear the answer. “Despacito” She responds. I begin to hyperventilate. My worst fears have been realized. I fade in and out of conciseness. I clamp my palms over my ears, but I know it’s futile. The song plays. I’m crying now, praying. God, Allah, Buddha please help me. I curl up on the floor. There’s nothing I can do now. And then it happens. The chorus plays. The girls in my class open their mouths. The screams of the damned, the shrieks of the tortured fill my ears and bounce around my skull. My eardrums rupture, blood leaking out. I try to scream, but no sound comes out. I can only sit there, violently shaking as it happens to me. After what seems like hours, it’s finally over. I try to move, but I cannot make myself. My brain shuts down as my vision fades to black. I muster the last of my energy, uttering the accursed word.

“Despacito”

Dora the Explorer is actually much deeper than most viewers think. It is much more than a kid's show, it has clevers references and a hidden backstory for the adults watching with their infant but most older consumers do not understand them because they are simply not smart enough to. For example, Boots the monkey is deeply inspired by Hanuman from Indian mythology. Hanuman is revered for his bravery, loyalty, and devotion. Guess which monkey is loyal, brave, and devoted to Dora? That's right, Boots. But it's not just Boots. What about Swiper? Foxes are often characterised to be sly and cunning. In Dogon mythology, the pale fox is the trickster god of the desert. He would only come out in attempt to fool man whether that was for personal gain or simply for his own amusement. He was often fended off by being yelled at. Swiper the fox shares these characteristics. Now you may be wondering hiw deep this show goes, so ask yourself this: where is the rest of Dora's family? We have met Dora's mother and father, her twin baby brother and sister, her two cousins Diego and Alicia (who also love exploring, take note, this will come up later) and Dora's grandmother. Now Dora's parents and grandmother are clearly not the explorer type since they hardly ever leave the house. So who taught Dora to read maps, swing from vines and to keep safe? The same can be asked for Diego and Alicia, who also know how to talk to animals and track them. Also note how we never see any family of Diego and Alicia aside from Dora's family. They even live alone in the jungle. Here's my theory: an uncle of Dora (who would also be the mother or father of Diego and Alicia) taught the children the skills to explore and taught Diego and Alicia to care for animals but died in action. Now Dora loves to explore but doesn't know how to look after animals. What if this mystery uncle was training Dora to look after animals but died before he could finish? It makes sense. Now you may be asking me how I know its an uncle. If you are, you are clearly one of the many intellectually lacking peasants who cannot understand the deeper meanings of Dora the Explorer, it is glaringly obvious: Boots is the uncle; the uncle is recruiting Dora but then dies in action, then he is reincarnated as Boots to continue his training and to watch over Dora. The parents clearly have no worries about Dora going off with only a monkey to care for her. So do they family know who Biots really is? "Then what happens after Boots fully trains Dora" the inferior viewers ask. Well obviously Dora will go live with Diego and Alicia to look after the creatures of the jungle and then Boots will train the twins Guillermo and Isabella. And whoever comes next in the family will be trained before Boots passes away and Alicia will take over as the teacher, proud of the legend he has passed on. Still think Dora the Explorer is for kids now?

Downvoted for the /s tag, as always. Especially in satire subs like this, sarcasm is basically the majority of comments, yet the threads aren't full of /s tags cascading down all of them.

I don't know why some Redditors decide to ruin their comments with that stupid thing. It's like a stand-up comedian saying, "That was just a joke, by the way" after every punchline.

Fuck off with your stupid little shitty /s tags, they ruin reddit. They are cancer, they are absolute shit. Every single time that I see a /s tag my eyebrow twitches with fury. Don't you fucking dare use stupid /s tags because they are literally terrible and I do not approve of them at all.

Get rid of them and stop using /s tags because they are literally the worst thing of this here site. Yes, we do get sarcasm, we don't actually think that you were being serious and you actually managed to ruin your own stupid little insignificant joke.

It's a story not known to many. Grab a seat, I'll tell you. The hostage is Natalia Yoldoshev. She first met with Shuhrat back in '91, where they went to elementary school together. Natalia was a pretty young girl and all the boys wanted to hold her hand, and such was the case for Shuhrat. He wasn't exactly talkative, he liked to play with his toys and having grown up in poverty in the post-Soviet country of Uzbekistan, he didn't have many. His only friend Ansar has lost his father in war, and that made him quiet as a kid as well. Shuhrat and Ansar liked to craft new toys using junk people threw away, and while it wasn't impressive when compared to the relatively more expensive toys more fortunate kids had at school, they were content.

Their favorite work was what they called Matryoshka, it was just a food wrapper shaped as a hand grenade, hidden inside multiple layers of plastic and iron parts. They had no access to welding tools so they had to make do with glue. Shuhrat, being the brave kid he always has been, one day told Ansar he wanted to give Natalia the Matryoshka, and hope to impress her enough to sit next to her in class, and maybe even hold her hand. While Ansar wasn't happy about losing their favorite toy, he only wanted to see his only friend happy, so he accepted. Shuhrat was confident in his plans, and with his heart racing and cold sweats dripping from his hairline, he walked up to Natalia after school one day. She had her friends and a few boys walking with her, all awkwardly stopped to see what Shuhrat had to say.

But alas, he had none. He anticipated his gift to be enough, and he'd not need to talk at all. He hastily brought up his gift from his pockets, and handed it over to Natalia. She was curious, but also visibly disturbed by this not-so-aesthetically-pleasing cubicle. She carefully opened the layers one by one, until she reached the wrapper, which Shuhrat had coated in polish to look nicer for her. She looked at Shuhrat angrily, seeing it as an insult, and threw it to his face, proceeding to insult him and walking away. Her friends with her also stepped on his craft, and laughed as a single tear was sliding from Shuhrat's now filled with disappointment eyes.

Several years later when his family moved to Russia, he had already moved on from this heartbreak, though the deepest scars were the ones inflicted early. He worked several jobs at different locations, making enough money to support his family and also buy more equipment so he can continue his hobby. He had established a small sized workshop with functional welding equipment, along with an assortment of tools of all sizes, and during what little time he had he liked going around collecting metal junk to make them useful later. His abilities and experience had earned him a position at one of the biggest factories in his district, one he made his family proud for entering. A few months of working later, his father has fallen sick, and young Shuhrat was the only one able bodied enough to work in the family, but it still wasn't enough. Wanting to buy the medicine necessary for his father's treatment he had to sell all his tools and crafts, and take a break from his hobbies for a while. Although it certainly did help his father's situation, he still wasn't well.

One day at work one of his friends told him that the factory had been sold and purchased by someone else. This didn't really interest them other than a decrease in their salaries, but it was never high in the first place. During the first day of his ownership, the new owner decided to take a walk around, and meet some of the people now working for him. He walked into Shuhrat's workshop, not shaking his hand but greeting him with a stern look on his face. Shuhrat respectfully nodded, welcoming him. It wasn't very long until the young lady walking with the big man took a glance at Shuhrat, where she proceeded to yell in awe. "Kessikbayev?!"

Having recognized the voice, he turned to her, only to remember that face from earlier memories in his life. Natalia proceeded to laugh at him, and make a joke about how he still was playing in grease and dirt. Shuhrat didn't utter a word, but Mr. Yoldoshev was clearly not pleased with this. Two days later he was called to boss' office, where he was told that he was now fired, under suspicion that his daughter has told him that Kessikbayev was known to be a thief as a child, and he didn't want such scum in his factory.

He was devastated, and wandered the streets all day to find a job. He was hungry, and so was his family. A few weeks later his father had passed away, where Shuhrat had nothing to do other than to find a new life, and hope to start over. Being the son of a soldier, he figure he'd have no home other than military, and he quickly found himself among the ranks of Russian army. Exactly one year later his skills and experience with crafting and demolishing, he was assigned to the weapon testing brigade at Alabino firing range near Moscow, where he had plenty of time to work on Matryoshka, but with a different twist - the wrapper grenade inside was now a real and carefully crafted explosive charge, and the device was capable of breaching through most soft walls. His superiors were impressed with the design, and asked Kessikbayev where he was inspired for this gadget. He said nothing other than that he was simply creative. His extraordinary ability with explosives has earned him the nickname Fuze, and he quickly found himself operating in multiple countries, and having plenty of time to put his Matryoshka to good use.

CTUs worldwide has seen this device on multiple occasions, which earned him his spot in Team Rainbow. Having trouble pronouncing it, his comrades simply referred to it as cluster charge, and so they called it over all the missions they went through successfully.

Until one day where there was a report of a hostage situation in Los Angeles, where Kessikbayev was also called for duty. It was a caucasian female, caught and held hostage by White Mask forces in a heavily reinforced house next to a river. He was confident in how this went, he had attached his rappel rope to the roof, climbed slowly upwards, and placed his cluster charge on a plank nailed to a window.

Placing cluster charge.

To approach the situation professionally he also sent away a drone to see the other side of the barricade, to have one final look at the poor souls hiding behind it, hoping it will keep them safe. They didn't notice the buzzing of the drone inside of the room, where Kessikbayev located the hostage, tied up on the business end of the Matryoshka. His hand went to remove the charge to prevent collateral damage, but as he rotated his drone around, he recognized the woman's face, once again. Natalia Yoldoshev. Cluster charge going live...

I see through your sarcasm. In reality, you’re implying that I’m actually not fun at parties. Indeed, you are correct. First of all, I do not waste my precious time in frivolous social meanderings you Neanderthals call “parties”. They are a meager excuse to intoxicate your liver with hydroxybutric acid (alcohol, for those of you not versed in Chemistry). Moreover, parties are a gateway to the most debauched forms of human interactions; dancing, dalliance, and promiscuity. I pride myself in avoiding these simple pleasures for lesser minds. I’d much rather spend my Saturday night at home studying the works of Kafka. You children can have your fun. An adult such as myself has much more important business to attend.

To be fair, you have to have a very high IQ to understand /r/Atheism. The humour is extremely subtle, and without a solid grasp of theoretical physics most of the jokes will go over a typical reader’s head. There’s also the community's nihilistic outlook, which is deftly woven into our postings - our subreddit's personal philosophy draws heavily from My Little Pony literature, for instance. The subscribers understand this stuff; they have the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate the depths of these jokes, to realise that they’re not just funny - they say something deep about LIFE. As a consequence people who dislike /r/Atheism truly ARE idiots - of course they wouldn’t appreciate, for instance, the humour in Richard Dawkin’s existential catchphrase “lol get rekt christian scum xDDd” which itself is a cryptic reference to his epic poem The God Delusion. I’m smirking right now just imagining one of those addlepated simpletons scratching their heads in confusion as Neil Tyson’s genius wit unfolds itself on their computer screens. What fools.. how I pity them. 😂

pfffft, fucking WOMEN??? In my game set in WORLD WAR 2!?!?!?!? i SWEAR to FUCKING god, if these damn SJW's don't stop ruining everything in video games(like them being free from women) I wll FLIP SHIT. I am so sick and tired, of going online, only to find that the next GODDAMN CALL OF DUTY GAME HAS A FEMALE IN IT. In my opinion(the true one) Females, or any non-straight-white male characters are only put in video games becasue of this Mother Fucking SJW political movement that will never fucking end. If I see another fucking non-straigh white male in a game I am going to go to the main office of the developers of the game, and make sure to give them a STERN talking to.
I am so fed up with this shit.
I just want to play one single video game that doesn't have females in it, because you know WHAT??? IT IS SCIENTIFICALLY PROVEN THAT MALES ARE GENETICALLY PHYSICALLY SUPERIOR TO WOMEN, THEREFORE WOMEN USING GUNS OR BEING IN WARS ARE FUCKING BULLSHIT.
I remember back when video games didn't have females in them, games like Half-Life, SWAT 4, DOOM 1-3, etc., espECIALLY BLACK FEMALES.
LIKE Seriously? What is up with fucking BLACK people, BLACK PEOPLE, MORE LIKE BLASPHEMY, AMIRITE??? BLACK PEOPLE ARE ONLY PUT IN GAMES TO APPEAL TO FUCKING SJW STANDARDS SO THEY CAN GET MORE SALES, and so they can be as little offensive as possible, so they don't hurt the little SJW fee fees.

> Is this meme? I've seen comments like this on like every channel I watch recently and done of them is just like a dude bashing his head with a rock, that's a joke but for real it isn't complicated stuff. The first time I saw this was on a video that was, I suppose, more on the intellectual side of things so I was like, "huh maybe this guy is serious." Then I saw it on a bunch of retarded shit and now I'm seeing it here so I'm guessing it's just a meme I've never heard of. I'm 15 btw so I dont need anyone saying shit like, "What are you 7 how do you not know this meme?" Or, "Wow this old man doesn't know what memes are." Or anything similar. I'm just asking if this is a meme.﻿

I've created 85-87% of the Internet's most popular memes over the last 24 months. You might know my work - Who Would Win; It's Over Anakin; Hillary Clinton's Staff Are Pizza-loving Satanist Paedophiles. I promote my work primarily on Twitter and Instagram because it has the widest reach, and therefore the highest chance of rapid normification. I don't care about your elitism - I'm just interested in high-peak selling and quick turnover. If a meme stays spicy for longer than a week, it's a garbage meme for weekend reddit traders.

How would I mess with people if I were a billionaire? 

I'd go to generic restaurants, give my waiter/waitress 100 dollars to send a glass of milk with ice in it to a specific table. The 100 dollars would be to keep quiet about who sent the milk.
I would do this several more times to the same table until they got visibly upset. No waiter in the world would stop sending ice milks, especially after I raise the offer to 500 dollars.
If I were a waiter I would gladly keep putting glasses of milk with ice in on someone's table even if they were screaming in my face if I made 500 bucks each time.
So yeah, I would do ice milk, instant classic.

What fools... how I pity them. 😂 And yes by the way, I DO have a Bubsy tattoo. And no, you cannot see it. It's for the ladies' eyes only- And even they have to demonstrate that they're within 5 IQ points of my own (preferably lower) beforehand.

Hello my beautiful goddess, I saw your profile and figured id try writing you. i can't disrespect a girl. It's not in me. I'm a gentleman. Quite honestly, It sure surprised me to see you on here. I just have a hard time seeing someone who could easilly be a model having trouble meeting someone. Im not trying to give you a line, you really are astoundingly beautiful to me. It would be a pleasure and a priviledge getting to know you. I'd love to find out if you are as beautiful inside as you are out. Hope to hear from you soon, Dasha.

Have any of you had a girlfriend tell you that watching porn is the same as cheating on them? I mean here I was thinking that cheating would be like kissing another girl who isn't your girlfriend on the less extreme side and having sex with another girl on the extreme side. Never once did watching sex calculate into cheating for me because I was under the impression it required you to so something with someone else. I was wondering how reddit felt about this and if anyone can explain the female side of view on this because it seems I am missing something?

No globe, no poles. No poles, no North Pole. No North Pole, no home for Santa. So either Santa doesn't exist, or he is homeless. Being told the Earth is round is just so kids are more likely to believe he is a rich old elf and not a BIG RED COMMUNIST. Show me the horizon lines, bitch.

Australia is not real. It's a hoax, made for us to believe that Britain moved over their criminals to someplace. In reality, all these criminals were loaded off the ships into the waters, drowning before they could see land ever again. It's a coverup for one of the greatest mass murders in history, made by one of the most prominent empires.Australia does not exist. All things you call "proof" are actually well fabricated lies and documents made by the leading governments of the world. Your Australian friends? They're all actors and computer generated personas, part of the plot to trick the world.If you think you've ever been to Australia, you're terribly wrong. The plane pilots are all in on this, and have in all actuality only flown you to islands close nearby - or in some cases, parts of South America, where they have cleared space and hired actors to act out as real Australians.Australia is one of the biggest hoaxes ever created, and you have all been tricked. Join the movement today, and make it known that they have been deceived. Make it known, that this has all just been a cover-up. The things these "Australian" says to be doing, all these swear words and actions based on alcoholism, MDMA and bad decisions, are all ways to distract you from the ugly truth that is one of the greatest genocides in history. 162,000 people was said to have been transported to this imaginary land during a mere 80 years, and they are all long dead by now. They never reached that promised land. Tell the truth. Stand up for what is right. Make sure to spread the world - Australia is not real. It's a codeword for the cold blooded murder of more than a hundred thousand people, and it is not okay. We will not, accept this.Stand up for the ones who died. Let it be known, that Australia does not exist.

Back when I was 7, I loved my home. I was in my room just masturbating my little penis off until my mother walked in. She then called me a man-whore and told me to shove 10 fingers up her ass. No lube. I proceeded to do so. When it was all finished I questioned her with "Isn't this incest?" She then said "No son ur adopted fam, I thought this would be the best way to tell you." I then got head and it was all good.

Y’all better be reading your fanfictions. Y’all better be reading y’all smut. Smut. Oh yeah. That’s the good shit. I just love reading about how my favorite character fucked some other character. It gets me so fucking horny. I mean don’t you just love reading about how his big throbbing cock slowly entered her warm, moist crevice? It’s just so amazingly well written. Some fanfictions are actually the best pieces of literature I have ever read! The way the author narrates the literary work is beyond stupendous. 
Anyone who does not appreciate fanfiction for the art it is, is an imbecile, a moon calf, a moron; a fool, a saphead, a nincompoop, a mere dirt driveler. I have no respect for such commoners. I mean it leaves me stupefied to think that there are people who simply can not grasp why fanfiction and smut in particular is so vital to this culture and society. Without such magnificent creative works the idiocy in the streets would be amplified 10 fold! And the way some people read it as a joke?! With such careless licentious-ness?! It makes me want to give up and leave this forsaken world! With a strong animosity i say, frick the fan fic haters! 

If you ain’t talkin fan fic I don’t wanna talk!

Fapping to trap porn is the least gay thing there is. If you fap to gay porn, that's 2 guys, and that's 100% gay. If you fap to 'straight' porn, then that has a woman, sure, but you're also fapping to a guy, which makes it 50% gay. But a trap is like half male, half female, and thus a trap with a girl would add up to 75% girl, and thus only 25% gay. 2 women would be ideal, but that would be a lesbian relationship, which brings it around to gay again. If you fap to furry porn, then it's in a weird gray area, where if it's people in fursuits, the same rules apply, but if it's with animals, I would think it depends on said animal's sexuality. Then there's consent. If a person doesn't consent to something, but the other person does it anyway, that makes the other person stronger, and thus less gay. Let's say that means they're about 50% less gay. If it was gay rape, that means that it's now 75% gay. If it's straight rape by a man, then it's 25% gay. And, if it's trap gay porn, than that's 12.5% gay. So technically, yes, rape trap porn is the least gay porn there is, but that's still looped in with trap porn, hence why fapping to trap porn is the least gay thing there is.

I AM A GAMER. Not because I don't have a life but because I choose to have many. Gaming is my DNA and I am never alone. I have the gamer community with me. DON'T BE SURPRISED, gaming has its own benefit. IT HELPS IMPROVE ATTENTION, FOCUS AND REACTION TIME. Games also have motivational benefit because they induce positive mood states. They also have social benefits because gamers are able to translate the prosocial skills that they learn from co-playing or multiplayer gameplay to "peer and family relations outside the gaming environment." I did not make this up. REALLY. This was from an article entitled "The Benefits of Playing Video Games". Gaming also teaches YOU ABOUT LIFE. When you failed a mission, pick yourself up and try again. When things are getting out of control, press the pause button. Resume when you have gathered yourself. SO, ARE YOU GAME ENOUGH?

Being white is ok. Only a racist would get mad about that statement. People like you disgust me. Do you think I should be happy that I am white? Or do you think I should view my self as inferior?

Dont out yourself on this thread. Hide your racist ideologies in the sub you crawled out of. Remember "what would hitler say" and try not to echo him.

I'm a gay male, 16 and my friend is a straight male, 17. We have been friends forever. He knows that I'm gay and has been very accepting. Today, we were both in the locker room after gym and I was looking at him while we were changing. He is VERY attractive. I got this huge ***** and he noticed. 

I went over and pulled up his shirt to see him without his shirt on, he didn't mind. I got so horny that I pushed him into the lockers and we start to make out. We are going crazy! I started to take his shirt off and with his gym shorts already off, I pushed him in his boxer briefs up against the locker. 

It was beautiful seeing him in his boxer briefs and short white socks. Our boxers came off and he picked me up, spread my legs, and pushed me up against a locker. His penis went inside of me and it felt sooo good! We were going crazy and we both moaned so loud and then he came inside me! It was amazing! I then pushed him into a locker, spread his legs, and came inside him. 

Both of us were so happy and we started to put our clothes back on but, he put his boxer briefs back on and I got hard all over again. I went over, got him against the wall, took his boxers off, and ****** him. His feet with his white socks were off the ground because I was doing him so hard. He moaned so loudly! We were going absolutely crazy and then we both came inside each other again. 

After school, we did it again and this time *** went everywhere! We loved it and now, he's laying next to me in bed. We need a shower but that'll probably mean more sex again.

Canadians are an embarrassment this shithole has no culture history or national identity and they are actually proud of it. I actually regret that my parents moved here from Iran, they could have gone to any other country. In University the students and professors are proud of being cucks I had a friend literally say to a white cuck conservative student that Canada has no culture and the cuck just swallowed it. White Canadians are happy that they are a multicultural non-nation. A nationalist movement in Canada is litteraly impossible because there is nothing to be nationalistic or proud of. They got kikecked out of the British Empire because they were taking up space, they were founded by traitors from the American civil war and they achieved nothing of value throughout the 20th Century except being an American vassal state without any of it's own culture or desire to do anything at all. White Ontarians and British Columbians are all massive faggots, Albertans are all potential traitors who want to be cucked by America and think they are cowboys or someshit when they're all a bunch of fags and cucks and the Quebecois are the least gay but they practice the gay Scottish Catalonian version of nationalism. Do not give Canadians any respect they don't want any themselves litteraly all Canadian minorities are more patriotic than white Canadians because at least minorities see Canada as a whole as something useful to profit and exploit, white Canadians don't give a shit they are either proud of their faggotry like Ontarians or hate themselves and everyone else like Quebec and Alberta. 

I think I'll either move back or move somewhere else once I'm done here but I've abandoned all hope and respect for white Canadians It will be up to minorities to make this shithole great THE FIRST TIME and inject some testosterone in the gene pool.

What did you say that thing was called?

That’s a geyser.

A *what?*

A geyser! It’s kind of a hot spring that spurts up water and steam every so often. It works kind of like a coffee percolator. Water in passages deep down where the rocks are hot is heated up to the point where it would normally turn into steam, except it doesn’t because of the pressure of all the other water on top of it. So it gets really hot and it expands and it pushes some of the colder water out of the top. That relieves the pressure and all of a sudden the hot water turns into steam and *pow!* It erupts out, along with all the colder water on top. Then more water flows down into the deep passages, and the whole thing starts all over again. Most geysers are located in Wyoming, New Zealand, or Iceland. The word *geyser* originated in Iceland from their word ‘gjósa’, meaning gush. Geysers are usually very unpredictable about when they erupt. The most famous exception is a geyser called Old Faithful in Yellowstone National Park in Wyoming, which erupts every 64 minutes... er, give or take about three minutes. It looks like this one goes off a lot more often than that.

Um... thanks a lot.

Kevin Spacey was the youngest black gay slave during the 1800's. He fought with Nelson Mandela to achieve equal rights in North Korea while Hilary Clinton dressed up as a man and shot President John F. Kennedy. If it weren't for Mr Spacey, intellectual shows like, "Dora the explorer" which he starred in as the main character/protagonist, as well as "Rick and Morty", to which he was the original creator before selling the idea away to create the third gender in California.

Anyone know the source on this? Its pretty saucy though.

Uhm, ok. What was the point of this comment exactly? I mean, I get it. You like his comment and agree. You realized something incredible! Mindblowing. And you want to express that. I've had those times as well... let's face it, it's a normal form of communication. But, your inane comment simply adds nothing of value to the conversation. What does this do? Does it make you feel old to be part of the team? Does it make you happy to say that you're following his thought patterns? Is this really what you want out of Life? I think you can do better, son. That's why I'm going to use the parental approach, and give you a downvote. Not because I dislike you. But because I want to teach you this very valuable lesson. Contribute to conversation - to society, my friend. Don't be a follower, be a leader. Even if it means you get downteachered as I'm fairly certain I will (but I'm brave and wise enough to comprehend the ill and negligible value of internet points, so that's irrelevant).

The Blockbuster dude behind the counter ignored the late night crowd in his store while he reviewed the monthly tally sheet for ‘DVD Cleaner Kits’ sold. He hated having to hustle those shit DVD cleaners. Every time he asked a customer whether they wanted to buy one he felt as though his penis shrunk an inch. That being said, whoever sold the most at the end of the month got a box of Favorites and a $20 in store voucher for Blockbuster, and who needs a substantial sized penis when you’re in a locked bedroom with a box of choccies and season 1-3 of Buffy The Vampire Slayer to fill the seamlessly bottomless cavity of insecurity, loneliness and mediocrity that you have dug for yourself.

People are not exclusive to perverted thoughts. Sure, I've always thought about sex with other people, most of the time it's very taboo. Sometimes it's very brutal and honestly, I feel like I need to see a psychiatrist.

But it's not just people.

A few times in my life, I've thought about ejaculating into a shot glass to see how much I could fill it up. One day, I decided to live that dream. To my surprise, I was able to over fill the glass. I had to grab another shot glass and scrape the remaining cum into it.

With no one to share it with, I took the shots myself. Wasn't sour, a bit tasteless honestly. It was just a bit bitter was all. It's definitely exaggerated on how bad it is. I'm not saying *'Go drink your own cum,'* but it wouldn't be a bad first time experience.

A bit of spit and rinse was all that was needed to clean it. Went back to my bartending duties afterwords.

 To be fair, you have to have a very high alcohol tolerance to understand Browns fandom. The process is extremely subtle, and without a solid grasp of drafting analytics most of the FO moves will go over a typical NFL fan's head. There’s also Jimmy Haslem's narcissistic outlook, which is deftly woven into Cleveland's characterization- his personal philosophy draws heavily from Friedrich Nietzche literature, for instance. The fans understand this stuff; they have the hepatic fortitude to truly appreciate the depths of this misery, to realise that they’re not just pathetic- they say something deep about LIFE. As a consequence people who dislike the Cleveland Browns truly ARE idiots- of course they wouldn’t appreciate, for instance, the brilliance in Sushi’s existential trades “Trust the Proess,” which itself is a cryptic reference to Greek Sisyphean myth. I’m smirking right now just imagining one of those addlepated Pittsburgh simpletons scratching their heads in confusion as Hue Jackson's genius coaching unfolds itself on their football fields. What fools.. how I pity them. 😂

And yes, by the way, i DO have a Charlie Frye tattoo. And no, you cannot see it. It’s for the ladies’ eyes only- and even then they have to demonstrate that they’re within .050 BAC points of my own (preferably lower) beforehand. Nothin personnel kid 😎

John Depp isn't guaranteed to make more than $30 on a movie anymore, no, those days are done. He brings in about, maybe, 350 extra viewers these days. Because he just looks like a dope. He's just got a mustache. It's worse than this one. You know, he's quirky. He's gonna be, I dunno, Chuck 'e' Cheese, or, or Willy Wonka or something like that. Some sort of, ugh... He's cool? No. He's got a mustache. He's got a flop hat. He gets tattoos of, I dunno, witches and warlocks and, I dunno, bathhouses or wherever he hangs out. He was good friends with uh, River Phoenix. And uh, the thing about John Depp and how he gets his kicks, is he likes to watch his good friends die of drug overdoses, and not really do anything about it, just be high.

"May I ask what is the level of your education or even your levels of knowledge? While I do not degrade any basic-educated people nor less-knowledgeable, but for me to have a decent argument I look for atleast common ground that consists an important element called *logic* that you seem substantially lacking. I will, however, be humble enough to argue with you this time, yet very shortly because as much as I simplify my ideas, as much as you entirely, ignorantly interpret them. We're in a situation here that a kid accused me of being not liked by literally *everyone*. You're disputing me to refute this dumb assumption that I gave evidence for-- which I didnt have to because the claim is delusional. While I supported my objection with evidence, what you're doing here is *admitting* that people liked my content but under the reason of *coincidence*. Nonetheless, whether it is a coincidence or not, the fact people upvote my posts makes the kid's argument falsifiable, and makes you here even look stupider as you're proposing a weaker argument.

I like my woman know what she wants and not afraid to take it. You may be an obedient little girl, but at times, I just want to sit back and watch you take control. When you get me all hot and bothered, my thick cock throbbing with lust, dripping in your spit with precum, you certainly deserve to have some fun. Come on baby, let me see how you take me, grab this hard rod, ease that wet pussy on me and start rocking, I shall relax and enjoy your little performance. You should see it for yourself baby, that expression on your face when my swollen crown parts your tender pussy lips, slowly penetrates and fill you up till my hard cock completely disappears inside you, it is priceless. Is that what you have been craving all day? To fuck this hard cock and let it fill every inch of your tight little cunt? Work that hips now my dear, slam that pussy hard on my throbbing cock, I want to see how much you miss me, take matters into your own hands and let your body move, it is your moment now

As a man who totally cares about stuff, I indeed feel a certain way about this post which I'm assuming is a different view point of that of which that the poster holds, and due to my culturally influenced worldview that encourages me to look at things at surface level and then proceed to voice my personal opinion of disapproval to people who don't know me (who will then read my comments on surface level and respond in similar fashion), I must say that I am outraged and feel that it is a truly worthwhile use of my time to let the general public know this. As contemporary culture encourages such inconsequential and rudimentary arguments to take place, I expect opposing viewpoints from people I don't know to arise, to which I have already allocated time to proceed with such flame wars while attempting, poorly, to disguise them as intellectual debate.

ROBLOX recently has been removing features from the game to earn more money, many of these feature's removals have angered the ROBLOX community. Notable removals are the removal of tix, removal of body color management *not completely* and much more. I understand that ROBLOX needs a ton of money to run all of the servers they have, but at this point, they are almost a trillion dollar company. Most of these removals are useless and only destabilizing the community even more.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

𝐏𝐫𝐨𝐥𝐨𝐠𝐮𝐞

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

However, I am not here to discuss the moronic moves ROBLOX made, instead the moves they should make.es they should make. I am not doubtful that the people running ROBLOX will make good choices that can makeup for what they have done in the past, but it definitely seems like it won't happen soon. Anyways, let's begin.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

𝐁𝐮𝐢𝐥𝐝𝐞𝐫 𝐂𝐥𝐮𝐛 𝐏𝐞𝐫𝐤𝐬

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

A common pattern seen in ROBLOX's feature removals of cash is removals of NBC users. Since a humongous majority of ROBLOX players are NBC players, this is going to be criticized. It also doesn't make BC members any happier. ROBLOX of course does this to get more NBC players to switch to BC. However, there is a very, much more clear way to do this. Instead of removing NBC perks, ROBLOX should add more perks to Builders Clubs. How much more efficient will this be however?

Despite what the ROBLOX administration may believe, but adding features to a premium membership will actually be much more efficient than removing features of non-premium memberships. When people are angry and want features back, they are actually less likely to pay money for them back. It would be much smarter to add more perks to BC, more people will think, "oh I want those features!" That will be thought a lot more than, "oh I want those features back!" Not only will the ROBLOX community be happier because of this, it will also make BC members extra happy!

Many people will probably think I am just saying this because I am a BC member myself, but let me tell you otherwise. I think that this act would help everyone a lot more. I probably won't even be BC by the time anything is done, if it is at all. In conclusion for this chapter, I think we can all agree that this would be the best decision for ROBLOX to make as of now.

First of all, as a disclaimer, I am not a dog eater myself nor am I a vegan. I don't get people who accuse doge eaters while they are enjoying their beef and pork. I don't think they have a rational logic behind the hate behind dog eating.

I think most of the reasons they claim dog eating is vulgar are that "dogs are cute", or "dogs are human's best friend" or whatever. I believe that none of which logically makes sense. 

The "dogs are cute" argument is subjective, plus accusing someone of eating something due to its looks is ironical. There is no logic behind accusing someone who ate something ugly, pretty, cute, or whatever adjective you wanna put.

The "dogs are human's best friend" is also bullshit as cows and pigs can be equally domesticated like dogs, if someone chooses to do so. They can think rationally like dogs do, they can do the same things that dogs do if they were to be educated the same way that dogs are. 

I don't get why people call Chinese people vulgar cause they "eat dogs". Maybe animal cruelty is one of them, as some chinese dog eating festivals or whatever, might not be performed in the most organized or hygiene way. However if you are gonna accuse dog eaters with "animal cruelty" while eating meat yourself then you are a hypocrite.

What the fuck did you just fucking say to me, you little bitch? I’ll have you know I graduated top of my class in business school, and I’ve been involved in numerous trades in cryptocurrency, and I have over 300 confirmed sales. I am trained in pump and dump and I’m the top broker in the entire UK stockbroker forces. You are nothing to me but just another investor. I will wipe your wallet the fuck out with precision the likes of which has never been seen before on this Earth, mark my fucking words. You think you can get away with saying that shit to me over the Internet? Think again, fucker. As we speak I am contacting my secret network of hackers across the UK and your Bitcoin private key is being deciphered right now so you better prepare for the storm, maggot. The storm that wipes out the pathetic little thing you call your crypto protofolio. You’re fucking dead, kid. I can be anywhere, anytime, and I can outbuy you in over seven hundred currencies, and that’s just with my CEX account. Not only am I extensively trained in chart analysis, but I have access to the entire arsenal of the cryptocurrency chats and I will use it to its full extent to wipe your miserable wallet off the face of the continent, you little shit. If only you could have known what unholy retribution your little “clever” comment was about to bring down upon you, maybe you would have held your fucking tongue. But you couldn’t, you didn’t, and now you’re paying the price, literally, you goddamn idiot. I will shit fury all over you and you will drown in it. You’re Bitcoins are already gone, kiddo.

Are you proud of my creation? Feel free to copy it everywhere.

I know it's not /r/offmychest but I gotta confess. Without bubberducky, my life loses meaning.

Sometimes I just curl up into the fetal position for hours on end, silently whispering to myself that maybe bubberducky 3 will be released by Dunko, that Keyori won't make some lame copy, and that there is more to life than waiting for another bubberducky to be released.

You ever have a poop that isn’t necessarily large or magnificent or anything, but it  just really looks like a turd. Like, you look at it and you’re like, “Damn, that is a picturesque image of a turd right there.” Like, when I close my eyes and think about what a turd looks like, it is the spitting image of this poop I just took. It’s not like I ate anything out of the ordinary yesterday, or that I’m eating healthy lately, my body just spat out this perfectly symmetrical turd for no apparent reason. Why aren’t all my poops like that? Why today was it so great? What do I have to do for my poops to always be so wonderful? I’ve pooped more than my fair share at this point in my life. I’ve had soft stool, liquid stool, hard stool, long turds, little pebbles; the list goes on and on. Yet, it seems like the truly great poops are few and far between. Everyone should be lucky enough to experience perfect poops every day. I honestly feel that world peace could be achievable if everyone had great poops on a daily basis.

Seriously, I can't get over how much I fucking hate Mr. Electric. He's seriously the worst character in Shark boy and Lava girl. Like can't you just let max have one good dream?

Fuck Mr Electronic seriously like fuck him so hard. Worst. Character. Ever. Seriously. Wtf was with those stupid plug hounds??? Can't even catch max by yourself you huge pussy? It's so dumb. I hated that part so much. I always skip the plug hound scene when I watch the movie. Just because of how fucking stupid Mr Electric is in it. sharkbou was good though. If Mr. Electricity is in the sequel I'm going to. Walk out of the theater. Fuck. Mr elect

[A horrible sound is heard, which turns out to be Squidward playing his clarinet until the doorbell rings. Doctor Forrest is at the door]
Doctor Forrest: Yeah, uhh, we're with the pet hospital down the street and I understand that you have a dying animal on the premises.
[Squidward slams the door shut. The phone starts to ring.]
Squidward: Hello. You've reached the house of unrecognized talent. Please start after the [He plays a clarinet note.]
Squilliam: Sounds like you've got a dying animal to attend to, eh ol' chum?
[Squidward gasps.]
Squidward: Squilliam Fancyson from band class?!
Squilliam: I hear you're playing the cash register now.
Squidward: Sometimes. Uh, how's the unibrow?
Squilliam: [Waving his unibrow] It's big and valuable. I'm the leader of a big fancy band now, and we're supposed to play the Bubble Bowl next week.
Squidward: The ba-ba-ba... The ba-ba-ba... The ba-ba-ba?!?!
Squilliam: That's right. I'm living your dreams Squidward. The problem is, I'm busy next week and can't make it. So, I was hoping you and your band could cover for us.
Squidward: Ohh, uhh, I... I, uhh...
Squilliam: I knew it! You don't even have a band! Well, I'll just let you get back to the service industry now.
Squidward: Hold it! It just so happens that I don't sell fast food, I do have a band, and we're gonna play that Bubble Bowl! How do you like that, Fancy Boy?!
Squilliam: Good luck next Tuesday. I hope the audience brings lots of... ibuprofen!
[Squilliam and Squidward hang up the phone.]
Squidward: I gotta drum up a marching band fast! Drum... haha... band humor.
[In the following lines, Sandy, Plankton, Mrs. Puff, Mr. Krabs, and Larry are reading from a poster. Each are in different locations.]
Sandy: Looking to add fulfillment to your dull, dull life?
Plankton: Then become part of the greatest musical sensation to ever hit Bikini Bottom.
Mrs. Puff: And be forever adored by thousands of people you don't know.
Mr. Krabs: Not to mention free refreshments.
Larry: Practice begins tonight. 8:30 sharp.
[Squidward looks at his watch while driving a shell cart]
Squidward: Stupid music rental clerk made me late. That trilobite didn't know an oboe from an elbow. Elbow, heh, more band humor.
[The scene cuts to inside the room, where everyone is there.]
All: Blah, blah, blah, blah...
Squidward: People, people, settle down! Ok, now. How many of you have played musical instruments before?
Plankton: Do instruments of torture count?
Squidward: No.
Patrick: Is mayonnaise an instrument?
Squidward: No, Patrick, mayonnaise is not an instrument. [Patrick raises his hand again] Horseradish is not an instrument, either. [Patrick lowers his hand] That's fine. No one has any experience. Fortunately, I have enough talent for all of you.
[Squidward laughs. Everyone stays silent.]
Mr. Krabs: So when do we get the free food?
Squidward: Ok, try to repeat after me. [Squidward plays 6 notes] Brass section, go. [brass section repeats badly] Good. Now the wind. [wind section repeats badly] And the drums. [drummers misunderstand what Squidward means, so they blow on their sticks which blow out and stick Squidward to the wall] Too bad that didn't kill me. [Next scene] Let's just try stepping in the rhythm. Now I want everyone to stand in straight rows of five.
SpongeBob: Is this the part where we start kicking?
Squidward: No, SpongeBob, that's a chorus line.
Patrick: Kicking? I wanna do some kicking! [Patrick kicks Sandy in the leg]
Sandy: Ow! Why, you...! Why I oughta...! [she jumps on Patrick and starts fighting him until they roll outside and the doors slam shut]
Patrick: [Makes a very long painful scream.] [Everyone pauses and stare at the door, then Patrick sticks his head back in] Whoever is the owner of the white sedan, you left your lights on.
[Patrick walks in and it is revealed that Sandy has stuck his body in a trombone. Trombone notes are heard as he walks towards his seat. As he sits down, he makes a sound on his trombone. Makes a loud trombone noise as he opens his mouth. Stares at himself.]
Narrator: Day two.
[The scene shows the band walking down a street playing Semper Fidelis, badly.]
Squidward: Okay, that's perfect everybody. Bubble Bowl here we come. Flag twirlers, really spin those things. Okay, turn. Flag twirlers, let's go. I wanna see some spinning. Flag twirlers let's move! C'mon, move!
[The flag twirlers spin so hard that they take off into the sky and crash into a blimp, which causes an explosion. A trumpet player plays taps while everyone mourns, except Squidward, who just lies down on the ground.]
Narrator: Day three.
Squidward: How's that harmonica solo coming Plankton?
Plankton: It's tremendous, you wanna see?
[Plankton plays the harmonica by running to and from the holes quickly, but soon runs out of breath; on his way to the last hole he blows an unsuccessful last raspberry into the harmonica and faints.]
Narrator: Day four.
Squidward: Well, this is our last night together before the show. And I know that none of you improved since we began... [Patrick chews on a trumpet] ...but I have a theory. People talk loud when they wanna act smart, right?
Plankton: [loudly] Correct!
Squidward: So, if we play loud, people might think we're good. Everybody ready? And a one, and a two, and a one, two, three, four! [screen cuts to the outside of the music school and a blast of noise ensues, breaking the windows. Cuts back inside the music school, where Squidward's face is deformed beyond recognition, his shirt's been ripped, and his baton breaks] OK, new theory. Maybe we should play so quietly, no one can hear us.
Harold: Well, maybe we wouldn't sound so bad if some people didn't try to play with big, meaty claws!
Mr. Krabs: What did you say, punk?!
Harold: [shouts loudy] Big... meaty... claws!
Mr. Krabs: Well, these claws ain't for just attractin' mates.
Harold: Bring it on, old man! Bring it on!
SpongeBob: [tries intervening] No, people. Let's be smart and bring it off.
Nancy: Oh, so now the talking cheese is gonna preach to us.
Squidward: Wait, wait. I know tensions are high... [everyone gets into a fight. Pilar and Larry are yelling at each other. Medley slams a drum at him] There's a deposit on that equipment, people! [everyone uses their instruments as weapons. Mr. Krabs and Harold charge at each other with large woodwinds, but try to screech to a halt, and Mrs. Puff slams them both with her cymbals] Settle down, please!
[Sandy and Frank are fighting. Sandy breaks the xylophone keys from Frank and Frank runs away. Patrick kicks Sandy, who growls at him before producing a trumpet with an evil grin. Patrick realizes what's coming and runs away screaming as Sandy chases him with the trumpet. The scene cuts to the clock which shows it being 10 o'clock and everyone stops fighting.]
Fred: Hey, class is over.
[The band members walk to the door where Squidward slams it open.]
Squidward: Well, you did it. You took my one chance in happiness... and crushed it! Crushed it into little, tiny, bite-size pieces. I really had expected better of you people. I guess I'm a loser for that, too. Don't bother showing up tomorrow. I'll just tell them you all died in a marching accident. So, thanks. [sobbing] Thanks for nothing!
[Squidward walks away from the building.]
Patrick: You're welcome.
SpongeBob: What kind of monsters are we? That poor creature came to us in his hour of need, and we failed him. Squidward's always been there for us when it was convenient for him. Evelyn, when your little Jimmy was trapped in a fire, who rescued him?
Evelyn: A fireman.
SpongeBob: And Larry, when your heart gave out from all those tanning pills, who revived you?
Larry: Some guy in an ambulance.
SpongeBob: Right. So, if we can all just pretend that Squidward was a fireman, or some guy in an ambulance, then I'm sure that we can all pull together and discover what it truly means to be in a marching band.
Harold: Yeah, for the fireman!
All: Hooray!
SpongeBob: Now let's make Squidward proud. A 1, a 2, a skiddly diddly doo.
[The scene cuts to the Bubble Bowl]
Squidward: I knew this was gonna happen. They're just gonna have to find another band to play. I just hope that... [zooms out to reveal Squilliam is there] ...Squilliam doesn't find out! Squilliam! [screams] What are you doing here?!
Squilliam: Oh I just came to watch you blow it. So, where's your band?
Squidward: Uh, they couldn't come. They... died.
Squilliam: Then who's that? [points to SpongeBob and the rest of the band]
Squidward: [screams and his eyes pop out] That would be my band!
SpongeBob: We're ready to perform, Squidward.
Squilliam: Well, Squiddy, this is exactly how I pictured your band would look.
[SpongeBob dances]
Squidward: That's his... eager face.
[Squilliam laughs while they all go into the Bubble Bowl.]
Squidward: [everybody marches to the Bubble Bowl and starts performing.]
Well, I guess this will be the last time I can show my face in this town.
SpongeBob: That's the spirit, Squidward.
[The bowl raises above a football field.]
Football Announcer: Okay, football fans. Put your hands together for the Bikini Bottom Super Band!
[A crowd of live-action people cheering is shown.]
Patrick: These are some ugly looking fish.
SpongeBob: Maybe we're in one of those toxic waste dumps.
Mr. Krabs: I think I'm gonna be sick.
Squidward: [Nervously] Alright, everybody. [Glances at Squilliam, who grins and bounces his unibrow] Let's get this over with. 1, 2, 3, 4...
[The band starts to play a wonderful intro. Squidward opens his eyes, shocked. SpongeBob begins singing.]
SpongeBob: [voice of David Glen Eisley] ♪The winner takes all, it's the thrill of one more kill. The last one to fall will never sacrifice their will. Don't ever look back on the world closin' in. Be on the attack with your wings on the wind. Oh, the games will begin.♪ [Squilliam stares in shock, Squidward gives him a smug grin and throws his baton over his shoulder and uses his arms for conducting.] ♪And it's sweet, sweet, sweet victory, yeah. And it's ours for the taking, it's ours for the fight,♪ [Squilliam faints and gets carried away by stretchers. Squidward waves a smug goodbye to him and runs to the middle of the stage.] ♪And it's sweet, sweet, sweet victory, yeah. And the one who's last to fall. We will have sweet, sweet victory...♪
[Squidward jumps up and the scene freezes. It then fades to black.]

I've created 85-87% of the Internet's most popular memes over the last 24 months. You might know my work - Who Would Win; It's Over Anakin; Hillary Clinton's Staff Are Pizza-loving Satanist Paedophiles. I promote my work primarily on Twitter and Instagram because it has the widest reach, and therefore the highest chance of rapid normification. I don't care about your elitism - I'm just interested in high-peak selling and quick turnover. If a meme stays spicy for longer than a week, it's a garbage meme for weekend reddit traders.

People are not exclusive to perverted thoughts. Sure, I've always thought about sex with other people, most of the time it's very taboo. Sometimes it's very brutal and honestly, I feel like I need to see a psychiatrist.

But it's not just people.

A few times in my life, I've thought about ejaculating into a shot glass to see how much I could fill it up. One day, I decided to live that dream. To my surprise, I was able to over fill the glass. I had to grab another shot glass and scrape the remain cum into it.

With no one to share it with, I took the shots myself. Wasn't sour, a bit tasteless honestly. Was just a bit bitter was all. It's definitely exaggerated on how bad it is. I'm not saying *'Go drink your own cum,'* but it wouldn't be a bad first time experience.

A bit of spit and rinse was all that was needed to clean it. Went back to my bartending duties afterwords.

What the fuck did you just fucking say about me, you little bitch? I’ll have you know you have to have a very high IQ to understand Rick and Morty. The humour is extremely subtle, and without being involved in numerous secret raids on Al-Quaeda, having over 300 confirmed kills and a solid grasp of theoretical physics most of the jokes will go over a typical viewer’s head. There’s also Rick’s training in gorilla warfare which is deftly woven into his characterisation- his personal philosophy draws heavily from Narodnaya Volya literature, for instance. I’m the top sniper in the entire US armed forces and I understand this stuff; I have the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate the depths of these jokes, to realise that they’re not just funny- they say something deep about LIFE. You are nothing to me but just another target. I will wipe you the fuck out with precision the likes of which has never been seen before on this Earth, mark my fucking words. You think you can get away with talking shit about Rick and Morty over the Internet? Think again, fucker. People who dislike Rick & Morty truly ARE idiots- of course they wouldn’t appreciate, for instance, the humour in Rick’s existential catchphrase “Wubba Lubba Dub Dub,” which itself is a cryptic reference to Turgenev’s Russian epic Fathers and Sons. As we speak I am contacting my secret network of spies across the USA and smirking just imagining one of those addlepated simpletons scratching their heads in confusion as Dan Harmon’s genius wit unfolds itself on their television screens. Your IP is being traced right now so you better prepare for the storm, maggot. The storm that wipes out the pathetic little thing you call your life. You’re fucking dead, kid. How I pity you 😂 I can be anywhere, anytime, and I can kill you in over seven hundred ways, and that’s just with my bare hands. Not only am I extensively trained in unarmed combat, but I have access to the entire arsenal of the United States Marine Corps and I will use it to its full extent to wipe your miserable ass off the face of the continent, you little shit. And yes, by the way, I DO have a Rick & Morty tattoo. And no, you cannot see it. It’s for the ladies’ eyes only- and even then they have to demonstrate that they’re within 5 IQ points of my own (preferably lower) beforehand. If only you could have known what unholy retribution your little “clever” comment was about to bring down upon you, maybe you would have held your fucking tongue. But you couldn’t, you didn’t, and now you’re paying the price, you goddamn idiot. I will shit fury all over you and you will drown in it. You’re fucking dead, nothin personnel kiddo 😎

Women who love themselves are woke™ and also Real Women™. That makes them threatening because they are empowered and this is dangerous to the patriarchy. BUT! Men who love these strong powerful Real Women™ are woke™ as well and that means they know the truth. However, because they are men that means they will use that knowledge to further oppress the unwoke™ and woke™ women alike. Therefore they are more dangerous because their nature means that they can only oppress strong Real Women™, especially if they love them.

The elite are all about transcendence and living forever and the secrets of the universe and they want to know all this, some are good some are bad some are a mix; but the good ones don't ever want to organize, the bad ones tend to want to organize because they lust after power. Powerful consciousnesses don't want to dominate other people, they want to empower them so they don't tend to get together until things are really late in the game, then they come together and evil is always defeated. Because good is so much stronger. And we're on this planet and Einstein's physics showed it, Max Planck's physics showed it- there's at least twelve dimensions. And now that's all the top scientists and billionaires are coming out and saying it's a false hologram, it is artificial, the computers are scanning it and finding tension points where it's artificially projected and gravity is bleeding in to this universe. That's what they call dark matter. So we're like a thought or a dream that's a wisp in a computer program, some God's mind, whatever. They're proving it all, it's all coming out.﻿ Now, there's like this subtransmission zone below the third dimension that's just turned over to the most horrible things, it's what it resonates to, and it's trying to get up into the third dimension; that's just a basic level consciousnesses, to launch up into the next levels. Our species is already way up at the fifth, sixth dimension consciously, our best people. But there's this big war trying to basically destroy humanity because humanity has free will and there's a decision to which level we want to go to. We have free will so evil is allowed to come in and contend and not just good. And the elites themselves believe they're racing using human technology to try to take our best minds and build some type of breakaway civilization where they're going to merge with machines, transcend and breakaway from the failed species that is Man. Which is kind of like a false transmission because they're thinking what they are is ugly and bad; projecting it onto themselves instead of believing no, it's a human test about building us up.﻿ And so Google was set up 18, 19 years ago so that they wanted to build a giant artificial system. And Google believes the first artificial intelligence will be a supercomputer based on the neuron activities of the hive mind of humanity, with billions of people wired into it with the internet of things, and so all of our thoughts go into it and we're actually building a computer with real neurons in real-time that's also psychically connected to us that are organic creatures so that they will have current prediction powers, future prediction powers- a true crystal ball- but the big secret is once you have a crystal ball and know the future you can add stimuli beforehand and make decisions and control the future. And so then it's the end of consciousness and free will for individuals as we know and a true 2.0 in a very bad way hive mind consciousness with an AI jacked into everyone knowing our hopes and dreams, delivering it to us not in some P.KD. wirehead system where we plug in and give up on consciousness because of unlimited pleasure but because we were already wired in and absorbed before we knew it by giving over our consciousness to this system by our daily decisions that it was able to manipulate and control into a larger system.﻿

Seagulls do enormous poo. I've never personally had the experience but I vividly remember seeing a horrific but absolutely hilarious seagull poo disaster. It was at a local zoo and as we were walking back to the car there was a very large lady walking back to hers. I only mention her size as it seemed to really make the event more mesmerising. She was very, very big, probably over 300lbs. The whole thing was like slow motion; as she walked several seagulls took the opportunity to dive bomb and shit all over her back. It was absolutely spectacular. The graceful swoop of the seagulls, the pinpoint accuracy of the bombing run and the explosive impact as the lady stoically just walked on with a plodding determination. It just seemed to go on forever. It was very, very funny but I did then and still do feel bad for the poor lady as her clothes were absolutely fucked. I hate seagulls, they're bastards and I'd happily slap one.

I used to live by the turbulent ocean. Ive seen surf over 25 feet from my picture window. Every now and then I would screw up a pan, some cast iron and some not. Green scrubbies? Hell no. Brillo? Hell no!

   You throw them in the ocean. It isn't a dishwasher, it is, but you never know when the pots and pans cycle is done. Sometimes it's 6 months sometimes it's 2 years. 

   Just do a bit of beachcombing after every storm and you can collect rare treasures alongside your dishes,

When you came, you said to me as follows : “I will give Gimil-Sin (when he comes) fine quality copper ingots.” You left then but you did not do what you promised me. You put ingots which were not good before my messenger (Sit-Sin) and said: “If you want to take them, take them; if you do not want to take them, go away!”

What do you take me for, that you treat somebody like me with such contempt? I have sent as messengers gentlemen like ourselves to collect the bag with my money (deposited with you) but you have treated me with contempt by sending them back to me empty-handed several times, and that through enemy territory. Is there anyone among the merchants who trade with Telmun who has treated me in this way? You alone treat my messenger with contempt! On account of that one (trifling) mina of silver which I owe(?) you, you feel free to speak in such a way, while I have given to the palace on your behalf 1,080 pounds of copper, and umi-abum has likewise given 1,080 pounds of copper, apart from what we both have had written on a sealed tablet to be kept in the temple of Samas.

How have you treated me for that copper? You have withheld my money bag from me in enemy territory; it is now up to you to restore (my money) to me in full.

Take cognizance that (from now on) I will not accept here any copper from you that is not of fine quality. I shall (from now on) select and take the ingots individually in my own yard, and I shall exercise against you my right of rejection because you have treated me with contempt.

Hey guys wanna hear about how much pussy I eat? Lemme tell ya, I eat pussy like a pussy vampire awakening after an eight hundred year slumber only to realize they’ve built a fully staffed Nunnery around me. I powered a small town in Guadalupe for three weeks once just by eating pussy with an electrical lead attached to my jaw. They call me El Pusstolero whenever I go back there to, yeah, you guessed it, eat pussy. I ate so much pussy once that I forgot to breathe, died, went to heaven, and got kicked out for eating all the angel pussy. I woke up in the morgue and went straight to prison for what I did up in that bitch right after. I’m sayin don’t put me in a morgue you know what I’m about. Shit.

Uhm, ok. What was the point of this comment exactly? I mean, I get it. You like his comment and agree. You realized something incredible! Mindblowing. And you want to express that. I've had those times as well... let's face it, it's a normal form of communication. But, your inane comment simply adds nothing of value to the conversation. What does agreeing with him do?

I think you can do better, son. That's why I'm going to use the parental approach, and give you a downvote. Not because I dislike you. But because I want to teach you this very valuable lesson. Contribute to conversation - to society, my friend. Don't be a follower, be a leader. Even if it means you get downteachered as I'm fairly certain I will (but I'm brave and wise enough to comprehend the ill and negligible value of internet points, so that's irrelevant).

May the force be with you, and live stronk and Casper, OP Juan Canopy.

edit: excuse me, friends who I notice are downteachering me (I know who you are and how to find you), but the upteachers are on the right, so please aim correctly so that my truthful words can be seen by many. I know that's what you meant to do because you're smart, freethinking individuals.

edit 2: friends, I think you're on the wrong side. Upteachers are on the right. Please aim correctly. God forbid you were training to be snipers.

edit 3: ok, do I have to sit you all down and instruct you in how to correctly locate the upbush button? Thank goodness you're not GPSes... we'd be absolutely lost in space by now.

edit 4: are you all deficient in your sense of direction or something? I doubt it's just me. I know that when I uplearn, it's on the right. So yeah, def not me. It's $100% on you guys. Swear by Allah, if you were on a shooting range, you'd end up shooting yourselves in the faces with this horrific aim of yours. IT'S ON THE RIGHT. Learn to uplearn correctly. Geez, I've only been on this site a few hours and even I've picked it up.

edit 5: it appears I have not made myself clear. Read carefully: Uplearn. Right. Click it. Right side. Not left. Right. I have not left the right side on the left, as my username may imply. Right. Ffs, if you guys were carpenters, your hands would be a mangled mess by now, and you'd probably be getting amazing worker's compensation. Health insurance companies hate them!

Indeed. This is one of a mere few good posts.

It really can be bad. When the vast majority of Reddit's content is utter hooey, viewing such blaggadry all the time can only lead to further harm. Honestly, if most of Reddit's posts seem interesting to you, then, my friend, I think you need a serious chiroredditic adjustment! 😅

Not to offend your sensibilities, of course, but I've been on this website for less than one day, and boy oh boy, is there a lot of garbage. And that's considering just what's on the front page, which is supposed to be the epitome of content that we consume from the contemporary, modern World Wide Web.

I was introduced to this website with such high expectations. Lol and behold... I came to disappointment (that wouldn't be the first time I came to disappointment, of course (particularly in my house and bedroom (wait, I know this sounds dirty, but it isn't (it's referring to very personal experiences (but not sexual ones (at least not how the traditional Redditor defines them (granted, I doubt the average Redditor knows much about sexual experiences given what I've seen here today))))))). I, of course, don't want my friends to experience similar disappointment, and thus, vow to ensure I will prevent any ore new people from visiting this website.

Of course, efforts of such gigantic proportions require critical planning and subtle yet powerful execution. I must, therefore, start by fighting the system from within. The mission has begun.

edit: excuse me, friends, but I'm being very passionate, honest, and borderline heroic here, and the upheroes are on the right, so please aim correctly so that my truthful words can be seen by many. I know that's what you meant to do because you're smart, freethinking individuals.

I thought not. It's not a story the Jedi would tell you. It's a Sith legend. Darth Plagueis was a Dark Lord of the Sith, so powerful and so wise he could use the Force to influence the midichlorians to create life... He had such a knowledge of the dark side that he could even keep the ones he cared about from dying. The dark side of the Force is a pathway to many abilities some consider to be unnatural. He became so powerful... the only thing he was afraid of was losing his power, which eventually, of course, he did. Unfortunately, he taught his apprentice everything he knew, but do not let this distract you from the fact that in 1998, The Undertaker threw Mankind off Hell in a Cell, and plummeted 16 ft through an announcer’s table.

I saw you, and you saw me.

I know you noticed me, because we made long, significant eye contact/you flashed me your She-Ra underpants/you hit me with a tennis racket and a restraining order.

Still, it was a surprise when you smiled and told me your name/said you were in love with Jeff Goldblum but we could still be friends/shoved me against the wall by the bathrooms and started counting my taste buds with your tongue.

I've never been able to forget that moment, even though it happened fifteen seconds ago/during the first Bush Administration/during our previous lives as plague-riddled Cornish peasants.

And since then, I've been dying to ask: Could I take you out for coffee/borrow your garter belt/mount you, nostrils flaring, like a magnificent stallion in a mountain meadow?

You know how to reach me -- and I hope you do, because you have my heart and soul/artificial leg and left sneaker/jumper cables and 1963 Dole Banana calendar.

People are not exclusive to perverted thoughts. Sure, I've always thought about sex with other people, most of the time it's very taboo. Sometimes it's very brutal and honestly, I feel like I need to see a psychiatrist.

But it's not just people.

A few times in my life, I've thought about ejaculating into a shot glass to see how much I could fill it up. One day, I decided to live that dream. To my surprise, I was able to over fill the glass. I had to grab another shot glass and scrape the remain cum into it.

With no one to share it with, I took the shots myself. Wasn't sour, a bit tasteless honestly. Was just a bit bitter was all. It's definitely exaggerated on how bad it is. I'm not saying *'Go drink your own cum,'* but it wouldn't be a bad first time experience.

A bit of spit and rinse was all that was needed to clean it. Went back to my bartending duties afterwords.

This is it, man! This is it! The absolute pinnacle of Human artistic achievement. It may seem hyperbolic but I have zero qualms in saying, that without a shadow of a doubt; This is the greatest song EVER written. From Murray Heads' perfectly deadpan delivery of Tim Rice's stirring vocals, centring on the thrilling world of Chess in Bangkok, to the beautifully composed music courtesy of the creative geniuses behind ABBA. "One night in Bangkok" will eventually be recognised by music historians and linguists of the future as the most perfect distillation of the art-form known as music. It saddens me, to my very core, that kids of my generation prefer to listen to malodorous garbage like 1Direction and 21 pilots instead of this transcendent ballad. The music these days has the depth of a petri-dish; Truly I was born in the wrong generation. Give me Murray Head over Katy Perry any day of the week, no contest. Kids in my generation have no appreciation for luminous, transcendent art such as this. Many wouldn't even be able to handle the sonic and intellectual complexities. For the past 10 years I have listened to this song each night before I go to sleep, as a result of this I have achieved a higher plane of existence. I dream of Chess pieces dancing to-and-fro as this song plays in the background on a neverending loop, and I wouldn't have it any other way! In conclusion; "One night in Bangkok" is the greatest achievement of the human race so far. Everyone should listen to this song and appreciate its wondrous brilliance. If anybody you love hasn't listened to this song it's your DUTY as a citizen of the world to introduce it to them!  Peace and love my brothers,  -Gerry﻿

There's a guy in my Art History class (I know, whatever losers) who I'm secretly battling over dominance by wearing awful hipster outfits. I don't actually know if he thinks/wants to do the same thing. But regardless, I'm determined to win it. I thought today I won FOR SURE when I walked into class wearing a knockoff blue Porsche (sponsored by Campbell's Soup) track jacket, my uncle's old 1995 jeans and leopard print Nike sneaks. But the son of a devil arrived earlier to class, wearing a Donald Duck shirt and a matching pair of socks. Note that the final blow was the fact that he put on the olive green cargo pants alongside the fake Rolex watch. Like honestly... What a fucking power move. I'll get back him this week, I just know it.

Here in Brazil we don’t celebrate Halloween. We nolebrate Nolloween, which is exactly like Halloween, but we do not celebrate it. During Nolloween, people wear nostumes, which are costumes, but we do not wear them because we don’t celebrate Halloween. For example, if you are a physician, you dress up in a physician nostume and go on with your normal physician day as if nothing is happening. That’s the magic of Nolloween, the Halloween we don’t celebrate in Brazil. As I clearly am not a league champion, I didn’t get to dress up as one, but I dressed up as a college student instead. Even though it isn’t pretty at all, this nostume is comfy and really low-budget. Happy Nolloween~!!

It all started out innocent enough. A few teaspoons here and there. Nothing serious. All my friends were doing it. It seemed like so much fun and who could deny how great it felt and tasted?

But pretty soon it was in all my drinks. Then my food. Then it WAS my food. Stroking strangers in thruway rest stops, sometimes 10 or 11 in a day, just to keep myself supplied with the creamy demon. Eventually I couldn't get off by eating or drinking it at all.

You promise yourself the first time you smoke it that you'll never spike. Only addicts spike. You're just having fun, could stop anytime. That doesn't last long, those promises are forgotten in semen soaked flophouses, rubber tubing tied to your arm. Waking up dry and desperate... sucking the mattresses. It got bad. Real bad.

But I've turned my life around. 14 months clean today. You wouldn't believe the stories I hear at the meetings. Hell, you wouldn't believe half the stories I tell. So don't do it. Don't get started. Trust me, it can happen to you.

It started off small. I got rid of all the clothes I didn’t wear or need, then furniture, decorations, etc. I only wore solid white colors, and threw out my makeup. Eventually I started to get rid of the things in my house like my bed frame, the blankets, and lightbulbs. Then the doors, and eventually kitchen appliances. My only source of heat and light was from a single lit match, blowing out because of the windows I got rid of. My hair started falling out and I became bald, my glasses dissolved with all the clutter of my house. I was no longer interested in possessions, which has turned this nation into an item hoarding, environment killing corporate lemming, a capitalist loving cuck. My anxiety is now gone, and so has all sense of Cartesian coordinates as I’ve adopted a bleek first dimensional lifestyle. My body has adapted to converting the suns energy into a main source of food and I no longer have a body, instead it resembles that of a mycoplasma genitalium. I float in the air through the night and the day. On the first day of every month, which is today, I will generate enough energy to send this message via subliminal brain waves into instagrams direct messaging system. Dare any vegan intersectional feminist cross my path and they will surely be destroyed. I am the ultimate being. The ultimate minimalist.

I didn’t mean to do that to my mom but I’m literally in shock from the earnings call tonight. I feel like I’m going to explode. Why the fucking fuck is TSLA down? This can’t be happening.

The first time I dabbed I knew there was something more to the simple dance move than met the eye. There was something about the dab that was special. Something, dare I say, powerful.

I've done research on the matter, of course, and I've started to pick up on clues. The angle of the arm where you tuck your head (henceforth known as the "Dabbing Arm") and the aerodynamic angling of the extended opposite arm (henceforth known as "The Rudder") create a symbol of power that was once used by ancient mystics. Why these wisemen used the Dab Symbol is unknown to modern scholars and is a matter of hot debate, but I believe that early man had discovered the potential power in the dab. Over millennia, unfortunately, it appears that mankind had forgotten about the dab.

That is, ladies and gentlemen, until recently. The Dab has resurfaced, supposedly starting around Atlanta, Georgia (though that's a matter of debate in the Professional Dabbing Community), but this begs to question *why*? Why has dabbing returned? Could it be that there are forces at work beyond our conception pulling the strings? Perhaps a benevolent God or deity has decided that our society was ready to embrace the dab, and that through Dabbing we shall reach enlightenment. On the other hand, it's also possible that the power of Dabbing was reintroduced into society be someone meaning to sew chaos. If the sort of awesome powers that stem from dabbing could be wielded by a complete novice then who could say how much collateral damage could be taken?

I believe that dabbing is connected to the Ancient Egyptians. Think about it; when you dab your Dabbing Arm is bent at approximately a 45 degree angle. The pyramids are also triangular and are roughly 45 degree angles. Start to see connections? Madonna understood this, which is why she wrote the song "Walk Like An Egyptian". Madonna truly is one of the brightest minds of this century.

But that's not it. There's more about Egypt than most would think. Who was hiding out in Egypt, and had incredible powers? That's right, Dio Brando. Was The World a Stand brought about by mastering dabbing? Perhaps not, though images from the Speedwagon Foundation paint a very convincing picture. [I'll let you be the judge.](https://img00.deviantart.net/6e94/i/2017/106/7/6/kono_dio_da_b__by_apocalotaurus-db6153a.jpg)

I've almost mastered the Dab, and when I finish my studies and research my power will be absolute. No one will be able to stop me. All the fundies and roasties will feel my strength. The Chads and Staceys will cry and scream "Please, u/banjomanagement, don't kill us!" and I will proclaim "Forget Funwaa. Have Gumwaa!" as I destroy them with my concentrated Dabs. The day of retribution is nigh, brothers. Some of you are alright, don't come to school tomorrow.

There's no woman in the world more beautiful than the African woman. Take Serena Williams. She's so fine - stunning body, beautiful face, exceptional talent and grace. It is those qualities that have prompted so much jealousy, disbelief, and amazement that some whites call her a man.

They're so used to the straight, delicate, scrawny type of woman. I call those boys. Now black women from Africa to the Caribbean are women. They have the characteristics that other women pay 1000's of dollars for. They've been wearing braids from the beginning of time but it was until a white woman, Bo Derek wore them in the movie 10 that whites decided to come out and admit how beautiful and unique they were.

African women have had big asses forever but it wasn't until a white woman, Kim Kardashian decided to buy some that whites decided that big asses are beautiful and sexy. These white women are so jealous that they decided that big asses and braids only look good on them.

Let's not forget all the white women who are going as far as disfiguring their faces to have those full luscious lips that black women have. My African queens need to take back what's rightfully their. OWN every feature and don't ever change! A real man will let you walk side by side not behind him. He will value your opinion and grow from your strength. Much honour to every woman of African descent wherever in the world you are!

You know, this reminds me of a story about the time I met Darth Vader. It was a Tuesday evening and I was drinking a Diet Coke, if I remember correctly, when all of a sudden Darth Vader walks in. He says, in that distinct voice of his, "Hey, can anybody help me with something outside?" So, being the helpful person that I am, I get out of the chair I was sitting in, set my coke down on a table close to the door, and walk outside with him. I ask him what he needs, to which he replies, in that voice of his once again, "Can you buckle my codpiece?" Now it's a dirty job, but someone's gotta do it. Besides, who was I to refuse Darth Vader himself. Just a side note, it turns out that it's really hard to bend down wearing that big suit of his, so he has to get someone to help him every time. So anyway, I get down on one knee, turn my head to the side to avoid making facial-pelvic contact, and hug his waist, joining my fingers together behind him. Once I am in position, I buckle the aforementioned codpiece. So that's the story of the time I buckled Darth Vader's codpiece. The end.

In a recent scientific study conducted by Harvard University, it was established that you are, in fact, gay.















$------------------$














I did the math and reserch, according to Wikipedia the average length of a penis varies from 5.1 to 5.9 inches.  I went for a safe 5.5 inches for an average.  The average radius from the core center of the penis to skin on the outside is .75 inches.  From this we can roughly find the volume with pi times radius squared times height.  This comes around as the average penis being around 9.72 cubic inches.  Next I found the average volume of an adult male.  I had to first find the weight, which according to Alex Schlessingerman's "The Physics Factbook" is 70kg or 154 pounds.  Weight is found by multiplying an object mass by the force of gravity 9.81 meters per second.  After taking gravity out of the equation the average mass of an adult male is 7.14kg.  I then found the volume by divinding this number by the average density of a human, according to Wikipedia, 985 kg per meter cubed.  The volume of an adult male was then found to be 0.0072516316 cubic meters.  Utilizing the volume of the average penis i found earlier, 9.72 in cubed I got 0.0001592828 meters cubed.  This means the penis is 2.19% of an adult males volume.  Assuming the lack of testosterone or female hormones makes the person a female, balls ignored for ease, fucking a trap is only 2.19% homosexual.

best argument against it is that most gay people only have a slight preference for men. this is why for so many years there were so few gay people - it was “costly” for them to come out of the closet and they were more or less satisfied by nailing their wife every once and a while. it is a choice....pretty much what spacey said the other day.

best argument for it is to encourage male homosexuality but discourage lesbianism because then it means more pussy for the rest of us.

The last time I had sex I was blowing this guy and when I came up for air, to kiss him, he said, “Jesus, you are so good.” What are you supposed to do when someone compliments you during sex? It didn’t seem right to say, “Thank you, I have worked long and hard for these skills” so I just sort of smiled and kept going because I don’t think he wanted me to stop.



I love sucking dick. I love the feeling of a dick at the back of my throat and I love opening his pants for the first time, not sure what’s going to pop out. I love it when he kicks all the way back, manspreads, and I get to be on my knees worshiping his cock. I want him to caress my hair, stroke my face, toy with my ears and maybe gently guide me along. The best, though, is when I glance up at him and see that he is in such a state of ecstasy — eyes rolled back into his head, mouth slightly open. Look at what I can do to you.



Everyone who sucks penises thinks they’re good at sucking penises. I have never heard anyone, gay or straight, say “I am such a terrible cocksucker.” Have you? We might read articles online with useful tips or suggestions about how to give better dome, but nobody ever prefaces oral sex with, “I’ll do it but I’m not very good” because that would kill the boner.



The secret to sucking excellent penis is not about cupping your hands or licking the head in a swirling motion or putting a mint in your mouth or eating an ice cube beforehand. That stuff’s for amateurs. You just have to be dedicated. You have to really, really want to suck that dick. Lose yourself in the dick. This doesn’t mean you need to eat the thing but you do have to be completely fascinated by it, the way it looks, the way it feels in your throat. You have to show that you can’t get enough.




I have heard too many people say that sucking dick is degrading, that worshipping a dick or being on your knees in front of your man is dehumanizing. Dick sucking is power. You have the power to bring him to an orgasm, which he could do without you, sure, but he can’t suck himself the way you can suck him. He needs you for that. He will remember how good you are and every time you have sex he’ll be so eager to have you do his favorite thing. When you’re out at dinner he’ll look at you from across the table and will remember and when he flashes you a smile this is what he’s thinking.




I suck dick because I want to. I really want to. So should you. But remember: it is not a race.

Memes are quite honestly, a waste of time. Why? 
They contribute nothing to actual society itself. Rather, they poke fun at it for the shittiest of reasons.
Memes are copy and paste, and die in a week. Seriously, all of them nowadays seem to copy each other, seemingly less funny the more people beat it into the ground. One guy takes a video and makes retarded effects to make their video more “Interesting and Original”, but it’s not. They are making a fool of themselves. They are plagiarizing a video and putting effects without any context. 
Meme Culture NEEDS to be dead. Since they are always killing every other damn thing under a week because why the hell not.
Also, they had to resort to illegal actions JUST to get Behind The Meme’s Attention?
This is fucking ridiculous.
Fuck you Meme culture.
It’s not even Culture. It’s copy and paste shit that gets annoying the 6 times that it gets played.
I no longer place myself in this godforsaken Society.
Goodbye﻿

Maybe someone loves this guy, maybe some doesn't, but after years he's still that friend that never keeps promises and you ask him to play something and he'd forget and say he's sorry and this is a loop, I tried but he never did the effort to go anywhere to be friends, never had any interest in anything else than how are you?, all he'd be was passive aggressive at times and neutral most of the time. Mostly anyone would be better friend than (Insert Name). 
I'm just the friend he never had time for that's why the negativity.

To all our readers in the U.S.,
We will get straight to the point: Today we ask you to help Wikipedia. To maintain our independence, we will never run ads. We depend on donations averaging about $15. Only a tiny portion of our readers give. If everyone reading this gave $3, we could keep Wikipedia thriving for years to come. The price of a coffee is all we need. When I made Wikipedia a non-profit, people warned me I’d regret it. Over a decade later, it’s the only top ten site run by a non-profit and a community of volunteers. Has it crossed my mind how much we could have made if it had ads? Sure. But it wouldn’t be the same. We wouldn’t be able to trust it. Most people ignore my messages. But I hope you’ll think about how useful it is to have unlimited access to reliable, neutral information. Please help keep Wikipedia online and growing. Thank you.

I was a hard 4 when I was in my teens and I knew this. 












One weekend I went to a friend's house and her bf had his friend over and this guy was a hard 12, like, hotter than Brad Pitt. So of course, I completely ignored him, not because he was a dick or anything, he was actually really nice, but because I know guys like him, they dgaf about making friends with someone like me. 











But he went out of his way to talk to me and I found out later that he had asked his friend to find a way for us to be alone, and when we were I just felt very awkward and would leave as fast as possible. 











He told me I smelled good, (thought he was just being weird) said I had pretty eyes, (creeping me out at this point) and when we were all sitting down watching a movie, he picked up my feet and started rubbing them like it was no big deal.












I caught on that he liked me after the foot thing. I was baffled though, it would be like if Brad Pitt fell for Kristen Schaal. (I like her, and think she's beautiful in her own way, but let's face it, Brad's a shallow kind of guy.)












We ended up sleeping together, and it was great. But he fell for me too hard, like creepy hard. Seriously started talking about meeting my parents, our future kid's names, etc...











This was all pillow talk. Not until he got up did I realize that he was a nazi. I'm not saying that because of the way he acted, no, he had a HUGE swastika tattooed on his back.













So I did the only thing I could think of to scare him off, I told him I had sex with at least 3 black men. I've never seen someone become more repulsed in such a fast manner, but it must've matched my initial repulsion when I saw his tat.











He refused to talk to me after that, which was ok with me. I saw him once more after that and he wouldn't even make eye contact.













My friend had no idea that he was a nazi and they stopped hanging out

I was only 9 years old.
I loved Rick and Morty so much, I had all the merchandise and movies.
I pray to Rick every night before bed, thanking him for the life I’ve been given.
"Rick is love" I say; “Rick is life”.
My dad hears me and calls me a faggot.
I know he was just jealous of my devotion for Rick.
I called him a cunt.
He slaps me and sends me to go to sleep.
I’m crying now, and my face hurts.
I lay in bed and it’s really cold.
Suddenly, a warmth is moving towards me.
It’s Rick.
I am so happy.
He whispers into my ear “Wubba lubba dub dub.”
He grabs me with his powerful high IQ hands and puts me down onto my hands and knees.
I’m ready.
I spread my ass-cheeks for Rick.
He penetrates my butt-hole.
It hurts so much but I do it for Rick.
I can feel my butt tearing as my eyes start to water.
I push against his force.
I want to please Rick.
He roars in a mighty roar as he fills my butt with his love.
My dad walks in.
Rick looks him straight in the eyes and says “It’s all theoretical physics now.”
Rick leaves through a portal.
Rick is love. Rick is life.

There is no reason to be disgusted. At all. Males have sex with one another all the time, including straight males. There is nothing disgusting or shameful about it. He is your cousin, you love him. You enjoyed the sex. Full stop. There is nothing wrong with that, dump the conditioning that tells you there is. If you want to do it again, do it again, as often as you want and as much as you want. It won't harm you and its fun for both of you. No shame, no guilt, no disgust - just enjoy. I'm serious. 

Believe in yourself, you are perfect as you are - and congratulations on being close enough to your cousin to do that and enjoy it - don't ruin it with negative and unneeded conditioning

Why has my diatribe been posted here? Do you think this is some type of joke? I'll have you know that I take this topic matter very seriously. The internet is filled with enough pointless garbage to fill a landmine the size of our own catastrophically magnificent galaxy itself. The last thing I want to see on this glorious website is an excess of useless comments which have no bearing on the outcomes of our existence. By the depths of my conscience, I cannot allow it!
I hope you understand this. It is my prerogative to inform the critical masses of this travesty that plagues our minds and our lives. Life shall come and go; death shall eat us alive; but I shall do what I must to prevent that which can be stopped. Somebody has to do it. May as well be me.

Hey Google searchers, looking to play Toontown? Don't. Really. Turn around, save yourselves. Remember the game as a good memory and nothing more. It's not the same and is frankly a waste of your time. And that will never change. It will never be good here.

/r/Toontown is closed. Following but not in response to serious yet stupid threats via manchildren made in October 2017, we've decided to say "fuck it" to this entire horrid community and just leave it to rot in its own filth.
We are happy to come out on top and generally put ourselves ahead by leaving this community in the dust. There were few good eggs but unfortunately many bad, who ruined the fun for everybody. Most of these people have been terminated by Discord and are now in a legal case.
Looking to join the Toontown community? Don't. If you're here from Google (we're pretty high ranking), turn around and don't look back. Remember the game as a good memory and nothing more. It's not the same and is frankly a waste of your time.
Let's have some Q&A:
Q) Otaku, why would you just close these communities - why not pass them off to somebody else?
A) A, because EVERY SINGLE PERSON WHO I HAVE EVER EVEN SLIGHTLY TRUSTED has turned out to be a child. Seriously. Startomas. TheRandomDog. qwrrtyy. TwinkletoesKat. Vanta. Natalie/SharpSensePlays. All little children who act tough and act mature but when they aren't handed the keys to the castle or get what they want like they are expecting they ruin everything and create a big mess and scandal. It is horrifying how nobody in this community seems to be able to take rejection without having a nuclear breakdown and when I say nuclear I mean NUCLEAR. It's like scary, because, it's like 100% of the time, too, because people here are just that fucking encapsulated by Toontown. It's disgusting and if they weren't such shitty people I'd almost pity them (but not at all at the same time). These communities are better off dead than being run by anybody else, and that's all to be said about that. Incapable people. We'll end it on a high note. Considering nobody could take getting fired from something like a man (infact quite opposite) was really just stupid and almost kind of funny. It's Toontown, for christs' sake! Take getting fired from an insignificant position like a man and at least preserve a little integrity! B: Fuck most of you. Why should I? You've been pricks to me the entire time I was here for no good reason. My "A" answer is solid as hell, but even additionally I'm certainly not going to have any second thoughts for reasons just mentioned. More than happy to keep it sterile and dead. Kill it with some class.
Because people are gonna think of it (and he's reached out), Mysteryman is decent, but honestly he's not active enough. He's just looking to do the ol' "assemble a new team and leave" thing again which is just the exact same as the above but swapping one imbecile out with another when they do bad. It will never end. And putting him back in that position seems like such a shame for him. Move on, man, holy shit! Regardless, I've had the subreddit longer than him now let alone been here for a really really long time to where this is "mine" and if I want it to die it should be able to. Just let it go. It had a good run and honestly got REALLY solid at the end with the approval-only system which was a DREAM and made for the perfect Toontown community. And it was for some time. And HELL YEAH, it's a shame for that to have to go but I know that A) I'm absolutely getting the fuck out of here and B) some idiot would come in and reverse that EXTREMELY IMPORTANT VERY CRUCIAL decision which turned this place from shit to infinity% shine and just ruin it all over again. So no. No chance.
Q) Will the sub remain read-only, or will it go private again?
A) Dunno. Probably read-only for a time and then I'll just privatize it again. Or delete all the posts. There's a lot of good stuff on /top/ but also a lot of junk mixed in. It really doesn't matter. I'll probably just leave it read-only and not be a major prick because it's a very important archive with some really important info - be the better person, y'know? Regardless, all content will be linked from a sub with this pretty message at the top. So it's a win win, regardless. Not that I really care. I'm leaving. This place can be like whatever, it doesn't matter in the slightest. Privatized, deleted, big picture of shit on the front screen, it's not gonna matter. It's closed. It doesn't need to be pretty. Hell, even if it somehow gets taken over I'm not gonna lose any sleep over it (I do not give permission though and would prefer it stay closed). Toontown is out of my life and I don't give a fuck. It won't be the same greatness that it was, anyways. Anybody looking to waste their time with this subreddit should just do themselves a huge fucking favor and stay away/don't bother.
Q) Why were you such a DICK?
A) Truthfully, I wasn't. Hell, even this post right here may be a little rash but I'm still not a bad guy. Right now I just give no fucks. Anywho, let's talk about my behavior real quick. When I started in this community in 2014, I was adored. Seriously. It was weird. People posted "selfies" with my in-game character, posted them here, and if that wasn't weird enough in itself, they got a shit ton of upvotes for it. I was liked, and for good reason (although back then I had more ego than I do now but that was mostly harmless and fixed itself a year later or so through natural maturing), then people started to realize what "moderator" meant and realized I was the guy banning them or their friends. Even if it was for good reason (it was), they'd naturally be pissed. So, there's one person who hates me. And then they tell their friends. So there's 10 people. And then those friends tell their friends, so there's 50 more people who hate me, and since that original person fabricated a story about me per se, they all REALLY hate me, when in reality that guy was probably banned for something really stupid like posting Swastikas all over the subreddit. Multiply "that guy" and the spread across 50 people of my name by a few hundreds (thus resulting in like thousands of people), and you have a majority of the Toontown community thinking I am a pretty shitty guy. Up until then I was like a saint though. I did eventually start making mistakes, but they were themselves in response to that initial false hate for things I didn't even do. Because whenever I tried to do things, constructive or even harmless, like a beanfest or something, I was immediately silenced by this undeserved reputation made from peoples' lies and not even given a CHANCE to speak. Which might I add is a terrible feeling especially if the content of said post/contribution was really quite good. And then I'd get pissed and do stupid things, rightfully so. But yes, they were mistakes. And I did slip up from time to time. And I regret that. But you have to understand people were doing and saying truly awful things to me. Really hurting me. Because I banned somebody they don't even know on Toontown for just reasons. I was basically mentally abused here for 4 years. So of course I was often a little brash, but I think that's a small effect on a very large problem. And I think I handled myself okay for what I was going through. Because you could not imagine what it looked like. It was horrid. But I stayed. I stayed for a lot of the people who failed me recently and caused this, which is disappointing, but I don't regret my time spent here. Because the reason I was SOMEHOW even fucking able to stay here (which most people asked me how the hell I went through all of that) was I had built up an amazing guard to insults and bullshit, which helps me leave here more self-confident than I came here. And that's fucking amazing given the circumstances!
Q) What about Toontown Apex?
A) Deleted. Maybe it is, maybe it isn't, but it doesn't matter. The result will be the same and to you it will be like it is deleted. So don't worry about it. It won't see a release or a leak and the channel will no longer be up in faith of the original project if at all. I probably won't put a closing video up. Takes too long.
Q) C'mon, give us some cool shit
A) That's not a question. Anyways. Apex aside, If I was as shitty as the rest of the people here you'd be getting a shit ton of fun presents, as I have both full TTR source and TTOff source (client AND server for both) in my possession among more
But for now I'm gonna be a gentleman and be the better person. Doesn't mean I can't tease.
It's actually kind of funny looking through it how much stuff people gave me and how I still have it all and somehow I remained the only asshole not to leak something and most of these people later stabbed me in the back
Teasing is fun but I'm too nice to spoil the executive tower lol - see I'm not heartless after all. Just remember Otaku knows all before you try to talk down about me in the future, might wanna watch yourselves and just forget about me like I want ;) And that's speaking for most projects which is kinda funny now that I think of it. Have some class!
Might as well actually post/release something I found cool though anyways, never before released or even known about AFAIK, just found these scraps/testing material from the TTR alpha development days (pulled from the direct source just minutes ago) and it can't harm TTR so here. It's just them trying to figure out sequences & parallels so it's harmless and useless code but at least it's cool and an awesome history tidbit - can't really complain about me releasing this because it's literally the most useless code ever. Maybe wikis and shit might enjoy it though and I like that kind of thing, it's the small source of ingenuity in this community, so here ya go, enjoy
and no Joey, before you freak out I'm not gonna leak it because I am DONE here, even though I think you're a bit of a douchebag who severely misunderstood me and what I was trying to tell you in private, I realize your hard work and genuine heart in your project (with a head in the right place) and I don't plan to ruin that further than all of the other leaks have, just remember that I am not the asshole you think I am - I'm actually probably going to end up deleting it because i'm out of hard drive space LUL (as tears rain down from everybody after reading that). I'd appreciate if your Discord team would stop stealing my server emojis though lol because that's just fucking hilarious honestly, thanks for letting me know I'm more special than I thought you thought ;)
Q) Can I take over XXXXXXXXXXXX?
A) No.
Q) Is there anybody I can trust in this entire community?
A) Probably not. It's funny at the end how many people showed their true colors of being absolute fucking children, even some of the most known and trustworthy people in the community really stepped up at the end to be real fucking imbiciles. Some of the big league guys too. It's kind of nice now that to me none of that matters. If you're sick of the Toontown community, just leave. Nothing's keeping you here. It's a nice feeling. Hopefully also you realize that most of the community creation here is power-driven, so probably whatever godawful Discord spawn pops up next, you probably should stay away. Whether because it's like Jimmy looking to get his internet dick wet, or because it's the people who caused this looking to feel good about themselves when in reality they're shitty people and are essentially starting a project on quicksand which is destined to fail. Hell, even Toontown Rewritten's official Discord ripped my server emojis today. It's kind of funny how much you all say I suck and then you continuously rip my and my friends' creativity that this community has never and will never see again.
Q) How about, who SPECIFICALLY shouldn't I trust?
A) Again, pretty much everybody in this community. But the people who got really fucking awful and made me threats were TwinkletoesKat, Vanta, Natalie/Nat/SharpSensePlays, JCWMM/PlugAndPlay (cops really have their eyes on my family btw so I'd suggest not making moves), and omar (vivi's man). Most of them are reported to Discord and police already and both are already actively investigating so it's just a matter of time but might wanna watch out anyways. Just genuinely fucking awful people in all corners. Don't trust 'em for even a split second. Their own stupid actions here will haunt their reputations forever. Not mine! A lot of the TTR staff is secretly questionable. The Discord staff specifically are a bunch of manchildren and I think branching out for them was a big mistake. Looking up AbsentHiya's past is fucking hilarious and he's on their team now. Funny. Dumb, but he's probably more embarrassing and a public-relations disaster than dangerous.
Q) Anybody you care to shout-out positively here?
A) I think Skye is pretty much the only one. I didn't even know her 'til the end but she's a genius of a girl and really stood up for me and we're great friends now and really has her brain in the right place and was the only popular one here who isn't dumb as a box of rocks and wasn't equally awful of a person. It's funny, the group that insults her really just lacks what she has. It really shows. It's out of secret insecurities and jealously. Food for thought. Anywho. Only other person (kind of, keep reading), I wrote Sarah/Miss Chaewon a big positive paragraph along with Skye about how I really appreciated her but it's probably just a waste of time (I wrote a few goodbyes but they're all just a waste of time too - so don't feel TOO special :P - yours was just the big nice ones like Skye) because she's stopped replying to me so I'm not going to send it (and she was basically involved anyways but nonetheless I gave no shits), so here's your little sentence of "thanks" I guess if you even care, if not that's fine. I have a few other Toontown friends I'm keeping around but they're not even really active in the community anymore so it's not doing them any service mentioning them here - no point, they know. But yeah. Pretty much nobody. Because big or small a lot of you fucked me at some point over these four years, and especially at the end. Hope you feel bad. If you don't that's fine, but I hope you know that means you're lacking a big human trait. Not my loss.
Q) Where are you (and K0ntra) off to, then?
A) This answer is for those that care as I know they're out there. We're looking forward to simply enjoying our fantastic budding life together. Without this nasty puss-y pimple of a community on our back, it'll be a much nicer healthier base to do that in even though we had no problem before. I'm grateful this all occured as now we can truly enjoy life without stressing or worrying about this damn place anymore. It's really kind of nice. And it's about time. We deserve it. So thanks to those who still cared, and fuck what you hear about me/us because it's mostly not true. Toontown is losing a very awesome duo of creativity, management, and love, as well as those AWESOME events - and we won't miss ya. This community is doomed. It ALWAYS has been. You are some real fucking shitty people, let me tell you. I hope you all take a real good look at yourselves and are self-conscious, because a lot of you genuinely fucking suck big time, like, failing at life level. It's sorry.

This one time, me and fuckin' buddy are out havin’ a dart
And fuckin’ buddy burns a hole in my coat
And I was like “fuck bud” ‘cause the coat was pretty new, right?
And he's like “fuck you, ” so I put his head in a snowbank
Just started fuckin’ feeding him the right left
Like fuckin’ boom, boom, boom, "you had enough yet?"
And he’s like “okay, okay, fuck, chill out, shit” so then we went out for a drink

I'm an immigrant from Eastern Europe myself and I came here with just my parents at age 8. In two months, I'm going to travel back to Europe and will get to see my extended family for the first time in 3 years. And you know what, while I pretty much constantly get reminded that I have barely any family in this country, that's better than the alternative. If we brought our grandparents and cousins and all lived in the same small apartment in the Bronx, we'd probably still be there. Instead I got a good education and am on my way to building a career where I can eventually help my family in Sofia a little more financially. It's better than them coming here and having to work low-paying jobs or being on welfare, while straining us financially to support them. We talk on Skype every week and it's fine. Life in Bulgaria isn't that great, and I'm sure life in Uzbekistan isn't either, but it's also not a war zone.

Don't let this distract you from the fact that Al Bundy scored four touchdowns in a single game while playing for the Polk High School Panthers in the 1966 city championship game versus Andrew Johnson High School, including the game-winning touchdown in the final seconds against his old nemesis, "Spare Tire" Dixon.

I don’t care what the police say. The tickets are solid gold… it ain’t cut up two by fours I spray painted gold. And it was Jesus who give them to me behind the KFC and said to sell them so I could get me some money to go to outer space. I met an alien named Stevie who said if I got the cash together he’d take me and my wife on his flying saucer to his planet that’s made entirely of crack cocaine. You can smoke all the crack cocaine there you want… totally free. So, try to send an innocent man to jail and see what happens. You should arrest Jesus because he’s the one that gave me the golden tickets and said to sell them. I’m willing to wear a wire and set Jesus up…

This subject is difficult for me to talk about because I am afraid of being judged, but I have seen such lovely women here on this website so I'll take a deep breath and start explaining.

I have a very particular interest, an interest of which has gotten me expelled from school. I was mocked and teased for my interest, but now as a 54 year old man I am blossoming in confidence and would like to share my interest with a lovely young lady on this website.
Now before I explain allow to me to tell you a little backstory of how this interest came about. I was 11 years old and I had accidentally spilled some PVA glue on the teachers chair. Miss Clarice, I think her name was.. fine looking filly.. anyway, in my shock I ran back to my desk when she walked back into the the classroom and sat down on the chair. A very loud squelch echoed across the class and everyone laughed, except for me of course. My eyes widened in shock when I realised she was not moaning in anguish, but in pleasure. She stood up, hiking her skirt up further so she could assess the sticky damage. Turns out she was not wearing any panties, and the glue was dripping down from her clitoris. She was moaning and groaning, tapping her fingers on the stinky white mess that I had accidentally made on her vagina. My classmates were in shock at this display, but I felt as though my heart were about to explode with love. The sight of her rubbing the PVA glue around her love-button made my young circumcised penis tingle in a way that was different from when my father would touch it during our shared bath.
Now you know my backstory, I am here to come out as a lover of sticky clits. If you have any of that sweet, sweet glue lying around then please send me a Yahoo and we can talk more. My dream is to find a sexy lady between the ages of 18-30 to rub PVA glue all around her love-nub while I watch and rub my erect penis. I have a birth defect which means I am unable to cum, but I will simulate myself shooting a load all over your face using a bottle of mayonnaise from my mothers fridge. She doesn't mind us using it. Half the time she forgets I'm even borrowing it, especially when I've been playing on WoW all day in her garage!

So that's it for now my beautiful goddesses, please Yahoo me if you are interested in my sticky clit interest. Hugs and air kisses, Bernard.

Really buddy? Tough? Think you know tough? ever sleep in a tent when it was 30f, then 100f? How about when your tent is flooded with water, or the smell of a dead animal overcomes your tent. How about when it's to late to even see, so you just sleep against your pack in your sleeping bag against a tree. While spiders and roaches crawl over your face. How about hanging your hammock to sleep, Because the ants at night in the jungle will eat you alive?. The point is, sleeping in a 3 star hotel with ac and clean bleached sheets is child's play and the only reason people have a hard time sleeping is because they don't know the sour. Tough? You have no idea what dough is.

Imagine driving on the highway, you look down and see a fucking snake coming atcha from under the steering wheel! You freak shit and start swirving like wild before you realize that the snake is here to cause no ill will. She is friend, not foe. Her intent is not to harm. She has something much more sinister planned. She winks at you before unzipping your pants and sliding them down to your ankles. She opens wide and takes your dick deep down her throat and into the pit of her stomach. She bobs. Up, down, up, down. You clench the steering wheel tightly, ready to explode. You cum so hard you shoot the snake clean off of your dick where she smashes on the windshield, coating it in a thin, translucent layer of cum and snake guts. She loved you intensely, if only for a brief moment. But now the moment has passed and you got a pile of cum and guts to clean.

I’m way to smart for rick and morty. I find the show very lacking in humor that is smart enough for me. Like I already know that “Pickle Rick”is a reference to Plato and his book of knowledge Symposium. It’s pretty obvious. The humor is just not subtle enough for us actually smart people. Those plebeian Rick and Morty fans are clearly not as smart as me, because I have very specific tastes. There is one show however that is smart enough for me, that is Total Drama Island. Since I’m majoring in Philosophy and Anthropology it just was such a great show. The references to Immanuel Kant and John Locke where clear yet subtle and were very funny. I recommend you watch it, that is if you are smart enough to handle it. 😏😏😏. I think an IQ of 435 is the minimum.














$------------------$














While most people laughed at the "pickle rick" scene in Season 3 of the Rick and Morty TV series, few people actually **understood** it. Me, on the other hand, with my 200 IQ (that's right, my IQ is **200**), am fully equipped with the mental tools needed to dissect the "pickle rick" scene in time to chuckle whilst watching it occur. No, I did not have to pick apart and analyze the scene, watching it over and over again, to understand the scene's *true* meaning. In fact, I knew Rick would be in pickle form immediately when Morty walked into the garage. BAM! Just like that, my brain calculated why the scene was funny and the *true* joke that was intended. Most people know very little about history, it's unfortunate, but that's just how it is nowadays. What, with the education system being so bad. Ahahaha. Dummies.
 No offense, you guys are just retarded. I mean, it's not like I'm trying to insult you, but you were just raised this way. Raised to be inferior to me. Do not fret, I hold you in **ABSOLUTELY** no contempt. Let's get back to the meat of the argument. So, history lesson, there was once a philosopher called Aristotle. He was like Plato, but more practical. Oh, and Plato, he was a philosopher too. Philosophers are people who think about the world. Do you know what that means? To think about the world? I wonder if you can. I truly do, do not worry pleb, this is mere constructive criticism, it is not intended as an insult towards you.
 You being inferior is **OKAY**, it is okay that you are inferior, not everyone can be as intelligent as me. Aside from my education (I'm a Harvard graduate, FYI), I was born with a 200 IQ. I wonder if you can even remember having read that I was born with a 200 IQ or if it's already exited your little brain. **ANYWAYS**, so, now we have established the concept of philosophers in your little pea brain. Philosophers = people who think about things. So, Plato, Aristotle. Both philosophers from the Roman Empire. Let's move forward in time a bit, yes, yes, let's move ALL THE WAY INTO THE 19th/20th century! So here we are. There's a hip new philosopher whose name is Nietzsche. So, if you've ever read Nietzsche you'll know he's a nihilist. Nihilism means "the world has no purpose", essentially. Nietzsche believed the world had no purpose. I have studied him for 10 years now at Princeton, it's such a nice school! I've had sex with tons of women during my stay there, women at places like that are attracted to big brain guys like me. It's just how it is, sorry chap. **SO** nihilism = no meaning in the world. This was groundbreaking for the time, prior to this, religion had ruled over the world. Christianity had dominated Europe, and everyone was obsessed with "meaning", ba! "meaning", what is that!? Hahahahaha, what a absolutely bizarre concept. 
Unfortunately, before Nietzsche could finish his philosophy he died of an STD, how dreadful! This was one of the single most troublesome things I had ever discovered in my life, second only to the fact that there are others out there with 201 IQs. Probably lying, probably cheated on their tests. Do you remember that we were talking about Rick and Morty pleb? Well, anyways, the "pickle rick" scene is what I consider to be the culmination of Nietzsche's work. I laughed, I laughed so hard at that scene because I was so happy, and I laughed because I realized how pointless the culmination of Nietzsche's work was anyways. Why had that concerned me so? Why had I cared so much about Nietzsche's work? The world truly has no meaning, few can actually come to this realization, but I did. If you had an IQ of **200**, maybe you would too! Ahahahahahahahahahahahahahaahahaha. Ah, I love a good joke!

Being a gender fluid individual, sometimes I feel more feminine and sometimes I feel more masculine. But part of me wonders if this is not in itself perpetuating patriarchal gender roles that quantify what it means to be “femme" or “masculine". What role do you think patriarchy plays in influencing how we define gender identity? It seems like for some people this would lead to a non-binary interpretation of gender, but what about those who are bi-gender? Individual identity is overwhelming important too. Thoughts?

To be fair, you don't actually have to have a high IQ to understand *Rick and Morty*. Most of the humor is obvious and easy to understand, although a minority of jokes can be fairly subtle, and without a solid knowledge of STEM topics, only the smartest 0.1% of funny _Rick and Morty_ jokes are guaranteed to go over a typical viewer's head. There's also Rick's nihilistic outlook, which is deftly woven into his characterization—his personal philosophy draws heavily from existentialist literature, for instance. The idiotic 50% of _Rick and Morty_ fans (i.e. the ones you see on /r/CringeAnarchy), who've been constantly demanding Szechuan sauce from McDonald's and screaming about Pickle Rick for a while now, think that they fully understand this stuff. Boasting about having (very) high IQs, these cringeworthy morons with an IQ between 68 and 90 think they have the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate the depths of these jokes, and they think that such humor is _more_ than just funny—even though the show, although not bad, is not that deep or smart though. As a consequence, many people who like *Rick and Morty* truly *are* idiots—of course these atheistic Bernie supporters wouldn't appreciate another widely-appreciated cartoon that's been airing on Adult Swim's sibling channel Cartoon Network called _Steven Universe_, even though _SU_'s fanbase contains insane Tumblr SJWs. I'm smirking right now just imagining one of those addlepated simpletons scratching their heads in confusion as they read through all those dank-ass copypastas making fun of them for being /r/iamverysmart. What fools... how I pity them. 😂 And BTW, I don't have a *Rick and Morty* tattoo since it's not necessary for me. Nothin' personal, kid. 😎

I'll now going to tell a story about Bill Gates and why he is not philanthropic. When he co-founded Microsoft in the early seventies, they were focused in simple software - "Micro" was for microcomputers, and "Soft" was for software. They were not founded as MicroSys. However, their debut in the OS market was just eight years later, in 1980, with the Xenix fork of Unix. It was only in 1981 that the major OS, MS-DOS, appeared to the markets. However, just like Windows is nowadays, MS-DOS was closed source. And in 1981 Bill Gates was obviously still in the head - he would only leave 33 years later, in 2014. Now I'll tell why that has to do with his philanthropy. As evident by his nature, Bill Gates most probably closed-sourced the OS because people did not depend on computers to live (at the time), and that risking company assets for a "greater good" when this greater good does not save more than a few computers would probably be dumb. However, in the past computers (and OSes) were too expensive), and nowadays, some people die playing League of Legends or are otherwise dependent to electronics; mainly cellphones, but more often than not often computers. And, guess what: MS-DOS is opensource, but not Windows. That means people probably suicide when playing League of Legends because "Windows has crashed :(". Which means Bill Gates actually killed people in China. So that does not qualify as philanthropy! Liar!

Nearly every post is some dunk ass meme that isn't even funny. Over time this subreddit is becoming a fucking scumbag like Jontron. To be honest with you, I am sick of it.

>I'm an ugly 3/10 beta male with no real discernable positive traits, I'm scared of anything and everything. I'm too timid and anxious to live life like a normal person. I haven't had a friend since was a child and I don't really understand how to even make friends as an adult. My massive inferiority complex has convinced me that everyone else is too good for me. I have nothing that makes me stand out as a desirable partner or friend, so I don't even bother out of fear of hurting myself or wasting somebody else's time. I have no hobbies, no passion, no motivation, no real reason for living, but I'm too cowardly to die, so I crawl lazily from day to day, living in the same rut, doing the same things, hoping something will change and someone will come to save me. Deep down I know the truth, no one can fix me but me, and I'm not capable of doing the job. I can't even perform basic tasks. I want to believe that I'm a good person who is just held back by shyness and anxiety but I know the truth, and the truth is I'm just as ugly on the inside as on the outside. If someone took the time to be my friend or my romantic partner, their life would be tangibly worse by association. All I do is spend my days on the internet, which has long since lost its luster, hoping and praying for someone to take pity on me and see a beauty in me that no one else has ever seen, but I know it isn't going to happen. There is no hidden beauty, no special aspect of me that makes me a worthwhile friend, I'm a mediocre lazy piece of human garbage who is living the unhappy life he deserves. The most realistic option I see for my future is finally working up the guts to pull the trigger and end my life, but I doubt I ever will. I'll be an old man, laying on his deathbed, filled with regret and remorse from a wasted life.

Yes, nothing out of the ordinary. Nothing sensational. I'm just a male feminist (I already fear for my life) who's constantly taken the piss for you all, and no, I don't want to get in your pants. Hell no. I'd rather talk with you about soccer, or steampunk literature, or buccal biofilms. Or female genital mutilation, or how my abusive, sadistic narcissist dad fucked up my mom's life (yet she won't divorce him).

Anyway, I'm slowly getting through breakfast while recovering from an acute infection. I love culturing/studying facultative anaerobes in Petri dishes, but they tend not to love me back (once they're inside my body).

I'm also typing this little nothing post, of course. Obviously.

A short post to say THANK YOU to every one of you. My heart starts palpitating whenever I encounter any material related to Women's issues, rights, and feminism. I'm still not sure why. Maybe I DO know why. I'll keep pressing for the day when Women in reception foyers won't be required to wear makeup to work, just to be nothing more than an aesthetic-in-stilettos for retaining the customers. I'll keep being irksome until Mario isn't tasked with rescuing a kidnapped, helpless Princess for the umpteenth time. I'll keep kicking until society ceases from requiring Women to acquiesce to marriage, child-bearing, looking pretty with layers of makeup, and avoiding "dirty" blue-collar occupations.

They can call me "white knight" all they want, deface my Twitter, and hurl abuses at this "SJW", but frankly, I don't give a flaming fuck.

I'm in this because SOMETHING HAS TO HAPPEN.

NOW.

Don't stop. Lots of Women have to be off their societal fetters. Make that happen. Oh, and fuck the patriarchy. The majestic elephants know how it's done. Even a bull in musth knows not to mess with a seasoned cow. She'll put him in his place over and again.

Maryam Mirzakhani surely is proud of you all.

On the cold afternoon of October 30th (not halloween so this story is real i promise) i went to look at garage sales for some new books to read. I went to my neighbor Mr. Name's house where he had a bunch of things to look at. I saw some boy walking away from his place with a CD with the "sonic.jpg" written on the disk in permanent marker, but I didnt care. Once i perused his wares, i noticed a signed copy of R.L. Stine's Goosebumps book Egg Monsters from Mars Bars. I then noticed that it must've been a special edition because the Goosebumps logo was a crystal-y red color, almost like the color of blood, but I said whatever. Mr. Name said I shouldn't buy the book but I can buy it for the low low price of 20 Bitcoins. Luckily for me, my mom mines bitcoins and got me 400 for my birthday. I gave the old fart his 20 bitcoins, but then he suddenly fizzled out of existence and said "i hate dust", but I didnt mind it. Once I came home I cracked open a cold one with the bois (my sonic the hedgehog plushies xd) and sat down to read. The story was going okay until I noticed the second letter on the first paragraph was slightly misaligned, which spooked me for a minute, but I gathered up the courage to trudge forward. Around 20 pages in, I noticed something strange from when I first read this cult classic of typography. The protagonist said "welcum 2 hel" and the sun outside went dark red, but I shrugged it off and continued reading. However, once I read the 196th page, I saw that the pages were suddenly blank. I then felt something odd on my left hand. I closed the book, and suddenly the title began dripping down into my hand! That wasn't a normal title, it was hyper realistic blood! (spooky!!!!) I then noticed that the blood then formed words. After approximately 3.294 seconds, the blood spelled out "ur dumb."

To 🅱️e fair, you have to have a very high IQ to understand Rick and Morty. The humour is extremely su🅱️tle, and without a solid grasp of theoretical physics most of the jokes will go over a typical viewer’s head. There’s also Rick’s nihilistic outlook, which is deftly woven into his characterisation- his personal philosophy draws heavily from Narodnaya Volya literature, for instance. The fans understand this stuff; they have the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate the depths of these jokes, to realise that they’re not just funny- they say something deep about LIFE. As a consequence people who dislike Rick & Morty truly ARE idiots- of course they wouldn’t appreciate, for instance, the humour in Rick’s existential catchphrase “Wu🅱️🅱️a Lu🅱️🅱️a Du🅱️ Du🅱️” which itself is a cryptic reference to Turgenev’s Russian epic Fathers and Sons. I’m smirking right now just imagining one of those addlepated simpletons scratching their heads in confusion as Dan Harmon’s genius wit unfolds itself on their television screens. What fools.. how I pity them. 😂

And yes, 🅱️y the way, i DO have a Rick & Morty tattoo. And no, you cannot see it. It’s for the ladies’ eyes only- and even then they have to demonstrate that they’re within 5 IQ points of my own (prefera🅱️ly lower) 🅱️eforehand. Nothin personnel kid 😎

>They targeted gamers.
>Gamers.
>We're a group of people who will sit for hours, days, even weeks on end performing some of the hardest, most mentally demanding tasks. Over, and over, and over all for nothing more than a little digital token saying we did.
>We'll punish our selfs doing things others would consider torture, because we think it's fun.
>We'll spend most if not all of our free time min maxing the stats of a fictional character all to draw out a single extra point of damage per second.
>Many of us have made careers out of doing just these things: slogging through the grind, all day, the same quests over and over, hundreds of times to the point where we know evety little detail such that some have attained such gamer nirvana that they can literally play these games blindfolded.
>Do these people have any idea how many controllers have been smashed, systems over heated, disks and carts destroyed 8n frustration? All to latter be referred to as bragging rights?
>These people honestly think this is a battle they can win? They take our media? We're already building a new one without them. They take our devs? Gamers aren't shy about throwing their money else where, or even making the games our selves. They think calling us racist, mysoginistic, rape apologists is going to change us? We've been called worse things by prepubescent 10 year olds with a shitty head set. They picked a fight against a group that's already grown desensitized to their strategies and methods. Who enjoy the battle of attrition they've threatened us with. Who take it as a challange when they tell us we no longer matter. Our obsession with proving we can after being told we can't is so deeply ingrained from years of dealing with big brothers/sisters and friends laughing at how pathetic we used to be that proving you people wrong has become a very real need; a honed reflex.
>Gamers are competative, hard core, by nature. We love a challange. The worst thing you did in all of this was to challange us. You're not special, you're not original, you're not the first; this is just another boss fight.

Here I am! The one who's about to fuck up this thread with my truth bomb.. I LOVE milk with ice in it. I'm a twin. She likes it as well. I wish I knew her Reddit handle. But hey, milk with ice is almost a fucking delicacy to me. I don't drink as much milk as I used to. And when I actually have ice, you bet I'm going to drink at least one glass out of that gallon WITH ICE. Why? It's cold and delicious! That's all. I drink it too fast for it to be watered down and I absolutely love the taste of whole milk. Yeah, I'm a weird person.

> You're a fucking idiot child. Ever hear of furture proofing? Ever hear of EverQuest 2? Crysis? Witcher 2? Probably not, because you're a millenial.

And, no, not everyone "knows Ark runs like ass due to devs not optimi*z*ing it", just fuckheads like you that have no fundamental grasp of computer games and hardware, and how to optimise games YOURSELF, to suit your shit rig, instead of blaming the game.

jacksepticeye is NOT a bad person. jacksepticeye is known for being the loud irish guy that likes to cuss a lot but he is much more than that. Jack is the only reason that i am alive right now. i have gone through great depression and i always come back to his channel because he makes me laugh and not think about all the bad things. jacksepticeye is a hero and life saver. people think youtubers are in it for the fame and money but actually they save many lifes. jack once said thing might bad now but they will get better maybe not right away but i did get better and i dont have depression anymore. so back off. he is an inspiration to me and many others. if u hate him so much then go conplain to people that agree instead of the peiple that could be dead.﻿

You give a ton of insight into the 'fanbases' of people like Ice and Greek. Thank you for that. I always am trying to learn new ways to understand weaker and inferior minds, I am especially intrigued with this new internet generation that no longer lives life.
There have been studies done that show that when intelligent children given computer time, they mostly use that time to learn and perform. For example looking up ways to cook or how to program code. Performing aka focusing deeply playing pretty much any game that requires a thought process combined with order. AKA chess or Starcraft. The children with the lower intelligence levels chose to play simple games like Bejeweled and watch popular content. Similar studies on intelligent people have also been done using television. Intelligent people were found to watch more shows with plots, documentaries, etc. The less intelligent people were found to watch things like reality TV, Pawn Stars etc. The reason twitch.tv's fanbase is so fickle is due to the lower intelligence levels. They choose to watch people play games without any rhyme or reason or watch people walk around a city with no rhyme or reason.
I know you can't comprehend what I just typed to you, but it would be such a good thing for this world if all very active twitch/youtube viewers commited suicide. These are weaker, less intelligent members of society that currently bring the average beauty of this world down.

Rook is the only good Operator. It takes a high-level of hand eye coordination to play Rook. Even then the player needs a fair amount of map awareness and an extremely high skill capacity. Not all players can main Rook, it is extremely difficult to utilize his gadget and one must know how to properly analyze the possible tactics of the enemy team before placing armor packs.

Rey is not a Mary Sue, you fucking idiots. She’s really powerful, that’s why she’s the main character of the new trilogy. Luke Skywalker was also skilled at the same things as Rey, and that’s much less believable, because he’s a whiny bitch. And if you dislike Finn just for being a black character who brings a little diversity to mainstream Hollywood you’re a fucking bigot, too. You think it’s “The PC Star Wars” when really it’s just trying something different. Get the fuck over yourselves.

Knack II is an action-platformer game in which players control eponymous character Knack. Knack can punch, kick, change size, deflect projectiles using a shield, and has other combat abilities. It features a skill treesystem where players can upgrade Knack's abilities by collecting Relic Energy found in levels. The game can be played cooperatively as well.

Development and release

Knack II was announced on 3 December 2016, at the PlayStation Experience event. The game is being developed by SIE Japan Studio. Marianne Krawczyk, a writer of the God of War series of video games, joined the development team to write the story script of Knack II. The game was released on 5 September 2017. A free demo was released on 29 August 2017 on the PlayStation store, allowing players to try out the Monastery level either solo or cooperatively.

Reception

Knack II received "mixed or average" reviews, according to review aggregator Metacritic.The game was largely considered to be an improvement over its predecessor.

In Japan, Knack II did not rank in the Media Create Top 20 or Famitsu Top 30 sales charts upon release. Dengeki reported that the title sold 2106 units to chart as the 35th best selling title in its debut. Comparatively, due to being included as a pack-in game with all initial PlayStation 4 consoles sold in the country, the original game moved 316,787 units in its first week.

Do any of you consider yourselves gamers? Now how many of you are PC gamers? Now to does who raised their hands to my second question can you imagine how difficult it can be to describe the beauty of gaming to mere civilians or console peasants who have the audacity to consider themselves “real” gamers? Well now let’s think about this; what is the purpose of video games. To me video games is a source of both happiness and crippling depression. To me video games is a spiritual and emotional sanctuary, a refuge from the chore of maintaining a social life. Now to many people video games games can become an addiction of sorts. Well that is according to the uncultured swine who have yet to grace by the almighty Lord Gaben (founder of Steam). I can see how it might be hard for these people to understand that gaming is not just a leisurely activity but rather a way of life. I might add… A superior way of life. Many overlook the discipline and focus which is required to be a gamer. In order to be a “true” gamer one must be willing and able to devote countless hours of their lives to the sport and put aside any distractions. These distractions include but are not limited to school, familial obligations, a social life and any physical activity beyond breathing and gaming. Much like how Buddhist monks devote themselves to reach Enlightenment being a gamer is a matter of great spiritual importance. Priests. Monks and rabbis are never referred to as being addicted to their specific religions. Then why should gamer be said to be addicted to gaming? Much like how people talk bad of the rich and powerful in order to demean them - people not able to understand the truths of gaming will try to bring down the sport through slander. Their inability to understand the pleasure and instant gratification from placing or destroying blocks in a world of your own creation, truly worries me. People’s inability to understand that developing golike skills in gaming is fruitful in many ways. One of the main attraction of gaming to me was to use my sensuous and godlike skills to woo women. My parent and teachers tell me.I have no life and that I am wasting my life away. However what is the point of a stressful and demanding education when you can live a much more satisfying virtual life in video games.
Gaming is not an addiction Not a hobby or distraction But a way of life Gamers Unite In Lord Gaben we trust Gaming is a must
God bless you and god bless NA.

Rick and Morty is the model TV show. Funny, insightful , the producers are leaders by example, constantly improving on the show's weaknesses, all the while being extremely well read that leads directly to Narodnaya Volya references. There's a reason he's held with such high regard by critics around the world and the extremely subtle humor that requires 200 IQ to understand is just a small part of that admiration.

First of all, let’s get one thing straight - catcalling is rape.  If you speak to a woman, compliment a woman without her permission, or initiate male gaze towards a woman without consent, you are engaged in rape.  Women have gained some ground in recent decades, making physical rape illegal on paper(though often not persecuted).  Other forms, however, remain legal and even encouraged by the media and (typically far-right) politicians.
Today, on my way to my theater class, I was walking next to the student center towards the fine arts building.  I forgot my earbuds at home today - I usually wear them so I don’t have my anxiety triggered by potential catcallers and crowdnoise (I suffer from several anxiety disorders - read my “About Me”).  Today, I walked quickly in fear towards my class, trying to avoid the paths of any males I saw, but that wasn’t enough.
One guy I avoided (who was about 50 feet away from me) shouted out “Hey, Megan!”
First of all, fuck you, I don’t have a name, and if I did, it would certainly not be “Megan.”  Secondly, I am a demiboy; I’m not even a female (though I am a womyn).  Thirdly, my presence in a public space does not mean I am public space.  You have no right to rape me with your attention or words.
Even right now, I’m feeling triggered.  ii thinkn i migjyht hhahve a ppaanick aattack oh godd its starting fuck 
thanks men hggo to helll

O well, I cannot be beat so they go afk and rage.Anime lover how many times do I have to say stfu and go suck on some kid. Your like 8 shouldnt u be in bed by now? Or has d2 consumed your life so much u dont goto school and sit around and play d2 all day.I sense rage Bryan. Does it matter if they can play a musical instrument? No. It isnt required in their music. They are singers, not rock groups. Its just like everyone else like Britney Spears, Jessica Simpson, etc. Do they play instuments? No they dont, they are singers. Its funny how u think everyone should listen to ur type of music, which Im guessing is rock, when all rockers do is play the same shit over and over again. Same drum beat, same everything. Rappers do a lot more then u think kid. Some have been in movies, and a lot will prolly be in movies in the next 10 years, and a lot of them donate to charity. Next time u try to diss out rap for being something that u dont like, learn the facts first kid. You have just been verballed.Cuz ur fuckin gay. I dont even play d2 anymore, and I can still shit on ur clan.Lol I dont even play d2 anymore randass, how could I have dueled ur shit clan? If u want I can go on there and shit rape ur clan 1v7.

Try to think up a comeback you fucking scrub. You seriously only say that. Like it even matters LOL. You are a joke. You fucking cried like a little bitch to Donny because your WoW account got banned. Kid is 28 years old, he fucking moved from d2 to WoW. Kid uses his moms welfare and food stamps to pay for WoW monthly, fucking sad. This retard rather pay for WoW, then to fucking eat. Seriously Dipset you get verballed by everyone. You were not good, you were horrible at EVERYTHING you do. Nothing has changed, just give up. What did you think Donny was going to do when you told him that, unban you from vent/d2pk? I don't think so, no one wants you back, that will not change.Yes I lie to myself. Why would I lie over the internet you fucking joke. Refer to last post fucking trash.Verbal essay. Kid got smashed. Nothing to say back? Thought so you fucking little bitch. You are under my control now, now fucking hang yourself like a good little bitch.Takes me 10 seconds to type. Making these kids cry is well worth it. I tried being nice, but it doesn't work for these fucking mental cases. Verballing them int he only way to go now. Fuck you in the neck! Fuck it, you know what? I get fucking psycho when I'm pissed. You keep pushing me day in and day out, and eventually you'll push me past the point of no return. You're a fuckwit who couldn't count with his own fingers. This is the end of the fucking line. That's why you touch yourself at night. I don't give a shit what anybody on this site says or thinks. I have slept with more girls in my life than you ever will. My dream is your worst nightmare. Then you will experience pain for the first real time in your life. No I don't read with semblance of comprehension. I read with unparalleled understanding. I see the meaning, motive, and thoughts that went into every word you type and every sentence you've ever said. I'm omnipresent and omnipotent. Your questions are idiotic, and your posts even moreso. You just keep making your little comments all the time thinking you're fucking cool. I'll turn your cable box on and order 20 pay per view channels at once. It's just a matter of time before I'm balls deep in your bitch. You don't even know wtf you're talking about. I'm going to knock you out in one punch and then fucking break your jaw with a heel to the side of your face while you're out cold. Yeah I thought so motherfucker. Go home and make love to your fucking real doll. I just went QED on your arse, punk. I almost want you to test me just so I can unleash the beast on your sorry ass and be done with you forever.

Kid there is no proof of him not killing you, even though I dont give a shit, its the point that u think u r god.Mf clan laugh. For reading 5 of the pages in this topic I realize that tdc is raging, colon is pmsing and drake is always hating on something. I see about 50 s/s of tdc being raped hard yet you Tdc randoms say u "raped" Otf. There is no proof in wat ur saying show s/s? I love how they cry about supposid "6 month old" s/s. I could post an s/s from 5 yrs ago its still a s/s of u being raped how old it is doesnt matter, all that matters is that u got raped by Otf. I could be like I raped Tdc 1v7 I gmed while u bmed, but do I have proof? No. So until you show a s/s of some kind of kill on Otf or any other clan or person for that matter, in that game then stop yourfuckin eraging.Rofl Ut randoms suck. Stop making up bullshit lies that no one believes. If your so "Godly" why do u guys use every hack and mod in the game? Shows how pro u r. Plus u even get raped with all those hacks and mods which makes it worse. Know one in your clan is good face it. You guys think your pro loaders and flooders yet u cant even keep a 150 bot load for more then 5 minutes how pro. You are going to load clan cell r u serious? You would get ass raped so hard your discs would auto break and uninstal themselves. Stop saying your good when everyone knows your not. If u actually do then prove yourselves because so far u havent.He sux in life.our a fuckin idiot LOL, Japan is in Asia u fuckin nerd.

#Fuck that.

Repost that shit.

*Own up to what you made.*

My friend does this all the time. Taking my shit and claiming it as her own. Every time I catch her on the act, I have to grab my plunger and beat her ass until I make her put my shit back into the toilet.

Fuck you Deborah, you can't be taking my shit when I'm trying to message everyone on discord an image of the dump I made after last night's Mexican food adventure pt. 3.
Just because you put my fecal matter into your toilet, doesn't make it yours.

I have figured out why we must go to school on spooky day.

Because school involves health/science class and science/health class involves nutrition and you know what's nutritious? Calcium. And you know what has calcium? Bones. And you know what makes bones? Skeletons. And you know what skeletons are? Spooky bois.

In case you're reading this asshole, I'd like to let you know, you're a piece of shit, an absolute fucking menace to society and the worst "parent" in existence. A fucking shark would be more caring, and they eat their children when given the opportunity.

You think I forgot that time when you yelled at me and sent me to bed just so you could hang out with the rest of the fat, balding cunts that you call friends? You think I forgot the time when I told you I could barely see, and you still sent me to school, and I only was sent to the hospital when I passed out, and even then you scolded me afterwards and forced Mom to pay the bill? You think I forgot that time when you hit me for taking your beer, when it was really that bastard Owen?

I can imagine it right now, your washed up miserable self, sitting in that chair you glued yourself to for all these years, which were needed until you finally realized how much of a cuck you were, suddenly the idea strikes you, that you could speak to someone and beg for forgiveness. But you know what, I won't give it you, you don't deserve it.

You are an actual idiot. You missed the entire point of that question. Jesus christ, what a goddamn waste of text. Are you happy with yourself? Literal decades went into making the internet what it is today. Hours of blood sweat and tears went into making the languages necessary to write this gay asf site, the same site that you have chosen to smear pointlessness onto. I really didn't think that I was going to reply to this post, but the more I read the question and read your response, the angrier I become, and the more I shout the lord's name in vain. I'm not even angry about the response. I'm angrier at the fact that you took the time to read the question, write that fucking post, reread your post to check for mistakes, rereread to make sure your response answers the question, and click send. Lord in heaven, there are so many failsafes in the brain to keep stupidity in check, but it seems that the stars have aligned.

A pipe dream, you say? You couldn't be more wrong. It is not a dream it is a reality that is forming around your Luddite bubble. We live in a time that has never had longer lifespans, less violence, less ignorance, and less suffering than now. Unlike the cavemen you romanticize, people don't die of the common cold or diabetes, they get treatment. Unlike your world, people can live to old age.
It is not a pipe dream, because I can tell you firsthand that I am the very living essence of transhumanism which ascends your naivete, ascends your pitiful Caucasian brain. I have enhanced my mind beyond human limits, and I am continuing to enhance it slightly daily. I have reached levels of creativity, processing, and memory that leave you in the dust. I have abandoned the need for sleep.
I am close to true answers, true transcendence, and while you continue to tie your hands to the bedpost to keep yourself from masturbating, while you lick your Unabomber poster, while you mind fuck your nature goddess, she will soon find herself slaughtered because I am advancing, encrypting, and revolutionizing constantly, constantly.
You see, Luddite, the future of us all will lie in my so called Star Trek hocus pocus. The medium will become nothing less than your ableist and transphobic demise. I think the medium has a lot of potential to be used as a means of open source revolutionary social engineering. Breaking down the barriers of gender and sexual rigidity for example, that you worship on your stone pedestal.
My simulations, our simulations, the godhead's simulations glorifies the destruction of the patriarchy, nationhood, traditionalism, mainstream religion, meritocracy, and statehood. Through creating an immersive experience engineered to counter oxytocin, we could make a lot of real progress, and we are making real progress as we speak. Not just in the simulations, but also in the simulations.
You'll soon find yourself in our simulations, like it or not. Especially once we've awakened the Demiurge and allowed him to drive it home, drive it home good and hard. You won't even feel a thing except a prick and then you'll wake up in the Garden of Eden. You will be molded, and you will transcend. Not by force, but by sheer purgatorial universalism.
We live in a realm that swarms with technological mediation, interlacing our daily lives with abstraction, distraction, and inaction. The Cyber-insurrection could bring us unprecedented cunning, scale, and vision. It could bring us a future in which the realization of gender, POC, and feminist emancipation contribute to a universal politics assembled from the needs of every human, cutting across race, ability, economic standing, and geographical position.
No more featureless and futureless repetition on the treadmill of capital, no more submission to the drudgery of labor, productive and reproductive alike, no more rectification of the given masked as critique, and of course no bowing down to the nature fetishism of your regressive bands of honkies. Our future requires depetrification, the elimination of whiteness, maleness, straightness, cisness, and any other form of rigidity or fossils. Like a wager on the long game of history that marches on endlessly, demanding imagination, dexterity and persistence.
We need to seize alienation as an impetus to generate new worlds. It is through, and not despite, our alienated condition that we can free ourselves from the muck of structure and the cage of atavism. Freedom is not a given and it’s certainly not given by anything natural. The construction of freedom involves not less but more alienation. Alienation is the labor of freedom’s construction. You think we're alienated because of technology? No, we're alienated by atavism and rigidity.
Nothing should be accepted as fixed, permanent, or given neither material conditions nor social forms. the Cyber-Insurrection mutates, navigates and probes every horizon. Anyone who’s been deemed unnatural in the face of reigning biological norms, anyone who’s experienced injustices wrought in the name of natural or supernatural order, all must and will realize that the glorification of nature and rigid spirituality has nothing to offer us the queer and trans among us, the POC, the MOGAI, the physically divergent, the neurodivergent.
Absolute and unstoppable technology in the hands of the oppressed is the only way forward. Why is there so little explicit, organized effort to use technologies for progressive gender political ends? Exactly, we need to strategically deploy existing technologies to engineer the world, totally and without hesitation liquefy existence. Serious risks are built into these tools. These tools, they are prone to imbalance, abuse, and exploitation of the weak.
Rather than pretending to risk nothing, the Cyber Insurrection establishes the necessary assembly of techno-political interfaces responsive to these risks. Technology isn't inherently progressive. Its uses are fused with culture in a positive feedback loop that makes linear sequencing, prediction, and absolute caution impossible. Technoscientific innovation must be linked to a collective theoretical and political thinking in which women, queers, POC, and the gender non-conforming play an unparalleled role.
In the end, we can create a world that transcends itself, forms itself, and progresses exponentially. The end result of the Revolution must not and will not be anything less than the complete destruction of objective reality. In thought, in energy, and in the finality of the matter. Freedom to do anything will be maximized with technology and consciousness both advancing unceasingly forward in a perfect union. The world will be unrecognizable, and free of any form of Caucasians, masculinity, heterosexuality, cisgender identity, asceticism, moral objectivism, neurotypicality, physical norms, material wealth, and class.

To be fair, you have to have a very high IQ to understand Lil Pump. The humor is extremely subtle, and without a solid grasp of theoretical physics, most of the lyrics will go over a typical listener's head. There's also Lil Pump's nihilistic outlook, which is deftly woven into his characterisation - his personal philosophy draws heavily from Narodnaya Volya, for instance. The fans understand this stuff; they have the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate the depths of these lyrics, to realize that they're not just catchy- they say something deep about LIFE. As a consequence people who dislike Lil Pump truly ARE idiots- of course they wouldn't appreciate, for instance, the humour in Lil Pump's existencial catchphrase "ESKITIT", which itself is a cryptic reference to Turgenev's Russian epic Fathers and Sons. I'm smirking right now just imagining one of those addlepated simpletons scratching their heads in confusion as Lil Pump's musical genius unfolds itself. What fools... how I pity them. And yes by the way, I DO have a Lil Pump tattoo. And no, you cannot see it. It's for the ladies' eyes only - And even they have to demonstrate that they're within five IQ points of my own (preferably lower) beforehand.﻿

Ever since I was a boy I dreamed of loading up 16 threads of compute instructions and achieving a 3.9 Ghz overclock on only 115 watts of TDP. People say to me that a person being a PGA CPU is impossible and I'm fucking retarded but I don't care, I'm beautiful. I'm having a plastic surgeon trained by Global Foundries install 8 SMT units, 14 nm FinFET transistors, 16 mb of L3 cache, and high bandwidth low latency Infinity Fabric on my body. From now on I want you guys to call me "Ryzen 7" and respect my right to use DDR4 memory and insert myself into the socket of an X370 or B350 motherboard and overclock on any SKU without restrictions. If you can't accept me you're a computerphobe and need to check your instructions Per Clock privilege. Thank you for being so understanding.

I remember when furry sex was just my imagination, but ever since last year, it became a reality. When most of my kind lock themselves in on the full moon, not wanting to hurt anyone, I get ready for the biggest, fuzziest orgy I ever had in a month. 

I was a young teen. Fourteen, maybe. I was walking home from the grocery store, and decided to take the scenic route home instead of the usual one. 

After five minutes of walking, I hear a howl. I couldn't conceive a wolf living in Tallahassee, so I guessed it was just another one of my gay furry fantasies. 

But... I hear it again... It was louder, closer even. I was scared. I looked around, I could hear something rustling through the bushes, but I had no idea where it was coming from. Suddenly, the noises stopped. It was only when I smelled the faint scent of blood over smelly dog breath that I realized what it was. I turned around. Good god, it was a massive thing, eight feet tall. It was black, fuzzy, handsome, ans it had some beautiful eyes, and a serious expression on them both. Looking straight ahead of me, I could see its massive, 10-inch, unerect dick, wobbling with every step it took. Its mouth, massive, was enough to swallow a man whole.

I was ready. Falling into the handsome beasts arms, I was lifted into its gaping mouth. I was going to die young, but my time would not go to waste. I could feel my dick, pressing up against my jeans, trying to fully erect. I could smell its hot breath, all encompassing my nostrils. 

It clamped its jaws, blood oozing out of my legs. The pain was bad, but bearable. I was having a true orgasm, nothing compared to fapping to the Deviantart page I followed.

But, unexpectedly, I was coughed out, landing on my ass. When I turned around, I saw an ugly, fat, naked, middle-aged man. Disgusting. It was nothing like the sexy beast I first saw.

It was the very next month, that I realized what I have become. 

I was ordering a fursuit off the internet, after saving countless amounts of money to afford it. When I looked down, though, I noticed that my chest was more than hairy.

It was furry.

I grew taller. My muscles bulged, busting out of my shirt. My massive dick exploded out of my originally loose jeans. I knew what I had to do. 

I jumped onto my neighbors house, and howled, trying to attract the mate I knew so dearly. 

He came, the same eyes, the same expression, the same, beautiful, wobbling dick. Oh... Yes... I pounced, and we wrestled all down the hill, humping each other head to toe. He shot his hot, white load all over my chest, and I lapped it up like a good boy should. It was glorious. And... I felt it... The sensation of unleashing my own load, coupled with being my true, furry self was more than bliss, it was indescribable how I felt. It all went inside his massive, gaping asshole, oozing all the way down to the tip of my giant werewolf dick. 

I finally got tired. We rolled over on our backs, and looked at the moon.

"I wish we could do this every night" I said.

It didn't sound like that coming out, but I knew what it meant.

"I do too." He whimpered in reply.

The sun was coming up. We were at it all night, apparently. 

"See you next month." I gave him a wink.

"You too, kid." He said back.

I am always waiting for the full moon to come again, but when it does, I truly feel alive.

To be fair, you have to have a very high IQ to understand 24/7 CTF. The gameplay is extremely strategic, and without a solid grasp of teamwork mechanics most of the sentry busting will go over a typical player’s skill level. There’s also F2P's oblivious behavior, which is frequently apparent in their movement - their gameplay experience draws heavily from 2fort battlement sniping, for instance. The skilled players understand this stuff; they have the skill to truly predict the movements of these noobs, to realise that they’re not just F2Ps - they are 24/7 2fort snipers. As a consequence people who dislike 24/7 CTF truly ARE idiots- of course they wouldn’t appreciate, for instance, the fulfillment in 2fort's challenging intel grabbing, which itself is a testament to teamwork and gamesense. I’m smirking right now just imagining one of those addlepated simpletons scratching their heads in confusion as a pocketed soldier main destroys their engi nest in their intel room. What fools.. how I pity them. 😂

And yes, by the way, i DO have a TF2 tattoo. And no, you cannot see it. It’s for the medics’ eyes only- and even then they have to demonstrate that they’re within 500 playtime hours of my own (preferably lower) beforehand. Nothin personnel kid 😎

the most aesthetically 🇺🇸pleasing🇺🇸 bird i ever saw was in miserable missisippi. here's my precious story: (please read with [this](https://youtu.be/ghhaREDM3X8?t=56) playing in another tab thankYou ;)

ok so i had to stop to use the 🇺🇸bathroom🇺🇸 in discusting misssisipi while on a road trip to earn a research grant with my 158 iq. i got out  to pee at a 🇺🇸marcdonald's🇺🇸 when i seen the most beautiful bird alive."that's a wonderful bluebird" i screamed at an ugly miiisisisispi woman.

"no that actually a misispii blue jay" she said

so i'm thinking "damn that bird's hot i need to 🇺🇸jack off🇺🇸 right now, surely no one in this fucking shithole they call 'misisilhpi' will care.so i take my pant off and start jacking it to the msisisisddkbfksjbi blue jay 🇺🇸😎🇺🇸

but apparently all the 🇺🇸autistic🇺🇸 tards in misisipopo thought i was dancing [oh whale](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/9e/Humpback_stellwagen_edit.jpg). before i knew it thirty msisisipians were all jacking off with me in perfect coordination.it was a spontaneous 🇺🇸dance number🇺🇸 i'll never forget.we all came at once and it was like a beautiful fountain of white, then the smisismippi blue jay said "thank you i am pleased"then majestically flew away

i drove away from muck-filled msiisisipi feeling a little less bad about it.it may the the shithole of of 🇺🇸pig's butt🇺🇸, but that was a beautiful bird and fun dance number 🇺🇸😎🇺🇸

He's says as he belly chuckles autistically. He hasn't left his mothers spare room all day but he's hoping this is it, this is his moment. He eagerly awaits a reply as his heart starts to race and he starts to sweat profusely whilst shoving cheesy salted snacks down his fat shit smelling throat. Unable to contain his excitement his tiny clit dick goes rock solid "I've just made fun of a handicapped little girl there's no way they can't reply" he sniggers in anticipation. Then boom they reply, it's happened, they've taken the bait, his days work his goal accomplished. He ejaculates all over his bed clothes but he doesn't care because him mom will clean them. "Sigh that was awesome.." He catches his breath and the reality starts to kick in. He gazes in the mirror consumed by overwhelming depression in the realisation of what a fat lonely loser he is. Time to troll some more.

So I was in my room with my naruto pillow all alone. Before I knew it the tension got too strong and he used his mangekyo sharingan to cast me into a hot anime land.Then once i got out shikamaru used his shadow possesing jutsu to force me to insert my MASSIVE GORILLA DONG into narutos bootyhole. The nine tails got mad thus unleashing the 9 tails cloak. The power is so strong he bashes me like kakashi bashed rin into nonexistence. I was fed up with the crap so i summoned the greatest hokage in the world konohumaru.  . Konohumaru used bootyjuice jutsu to beat naruto ASS. ANYWAYS i was wondering if that has happened to you before. I know im not the only one taking a fat L from n aruto senpai

 When a party abuses their power. An example on this was vast quantities of people in Russia in the 1700s, 1800s, and very early 1900s. They experienced constant oppression by the capitalist system. Thankfully, this oppressive and frankly absurd system was overthrown by Russia’s savior, Vladimir Lenin. Lenin was a professional revolutionary and believed in the superior  governmental system of Communism. The oppression manifested itself in the form of class struggles - freeman and slave, patrician and plebeian lord and serf - in a word, oppressor and oppressed.carried on an uninterrupted, now hidden, now open fight, a fight that each time ended, either in a revolutionary reconstitution of society at large, or in the common ruin of the contending classes. In the earlier epochs of history, we find almost everywhere a complicated arrangement of society into various orders, a manifold gradation of social rank. In ancient Rome we have patricians, knights, plebeians, slaves; in the Middle Ages, feudal lords, vassals, guild-masters, journeymen, apprentices, serfs; in almost all of these classes, again, subordinate gradations. The modern bourgeois society that has sprouted from the ruins of feudal society has not done away with class antagonisms. It has but established new classes, new conditions of oppression, new forms of struggle in place of the old ones. Our epoch, the epoch of the bourgeoisie, possesses, however, this distinct feature: it has simplified class antagonisms. Society as a whole is more and more splitting up into two great hostile camps, into two great classes directly facing each other — Bourgeoisie and Proletariat.

Don't forget Greg Hardy, you hypocrite. If you had one ounce of integrity in that smug old wrinkled body, maybe I'd care what you have to say.

You're a man who has been criticized for sitting during the national anthem that has threatened to bench or cut players for kneeling respectfully during the anthem. You're a man who has time and again valued profit over quality of product. You're a man who has gladly signed players with abusive and reprehensible backgrounds to your team, because you thought they'd give you a chance to win more games. You supported the commissioner railroading Brady, and now whine like a baby when acts the exact same with one of your own players. You're the asshole who works to obstruct and obfuscate research into CTE.

You're the gross reality of the NFL, Jerry. You are what makes it hard to respect or trust the league office. You have made this mess, and at the end of the day you're still going to make insane amounts of money no matter how much lamer it gets, so cry me a fucking river.

Your link doesn't, well... link for me.

Edit: Nevermind it's working now. It was probably my phone. Anyways, yes I agree.... I would very much like to have a cute Asian girl and a fake bomb. I would probably choose the Asian chick first though, because well, frankly, I've never banged an Asian chick before. I feel like it would be fun, like the forbidden fruit I guess. Plus, "Asian girl" is probably my most clicked on Pornhub tab after "MILF" and "lesbian".

Ok rant time haha. So I don't usually delve into personal beliefs and lifestyle on social media, as most people are just dense and judgmental, but I feel like I have no choice, bc I'm just utterly fed up right now. I am sick of witches being wrongfully potrayed and mocked by everyone, especially by little fucking kids. EVERY. SINGLE. HALLOWEEN.  


Firstly, I am a real wiccan/witch, it's my ancestory and I've been aware of my differences since a very early age and yes, I do practice REAL magic and no, I don't wear a black pointy hat and no, I don't wear a puffy dark dress/cape and fly a broom ( and if anyone had any education on witchcraft they'd know real witches don't need a broom to fly).


Secondly, I'm just letting everyone   know, including parents on here, that, if you come trick or treating at my house in a witch costume I will consider it a form of hate crime. I don't care if that sounds silly, bc when you have as strong beliefs as I do and constantly see them being belittled it fucking hurts.     
                                                                                                          
Oh, and final warning, I have mastered in dark magic which means I know a few harmful spells hehe, and if worst comes to worst I will not hesitate to use them.

I mean, I was fucking joking right? I don't know why they seemed to take it to seriously. It all started when I was just fooling around, living my sad waste of a life when suddenly an idea sparked into my head. I decided to make a funny little kinky joke, I laughed at it a bit. Then the person whom I directed it towards suddenly felt the need to clarify it wasn't true or that my joke did not have factual information in it. I thought this was sarcasm, since when do people take each other seriously on the internet? So I decided to go ahead and push the narrative anyway, this ended up in the person whom I originally directed the joke towards to get very angry, I didn't know why. When I asked him why he was so mad, he called me a pussy faggot and told me to go fuck myself. I wasn't sure if he was being childish thinking it was a good way to retaliate to my original joke ,or if he truly was offended, but after he insulted me, I decided to go ahead and insult him back. This resulted with him sending me weird pictures of people with cuts on their arms, images of firearms and bottles of something called Prozac scattered all over the place. I told him that this wasn't funny and he needs to stop taking the joke seriously, but while this was happening everybody else seemed to be repeating my original joke. I told them to shut the heck up but before I could, the cops were outside my door. I saw my face on the news and I was wondering why I was on it and thinking how cool it was to be on it at the same time. I then was transported in this very weird looking place with angry people who all had a skin color I never seen before, they looked like warriors from an ancient society. I was spat on, hit, some dude even tried to shoot me as I went into this place! I was put in this cage with another couple of men. Now I have a black cock in my asshole.

Here are 8 reasons scientifically proven why Donald Trump is so dang smart.

1. He learned about what he wanted to learn and not what other authority's like school wanted him to learn.

2. The parietal operculum region of his brain is missing. This lets other parts of his brain like the parietal lobe grow larger.

3. Parts of his Sylvian fissure in his brain are no where to be found. This enables the neurons in that part of the brain to work better.

4. Trump thinks visually. Instead of thinking about information and words; he thinks by visually imagining things.

5. His inferior parietal lobe is 15 percent wider than normal. This region of the brain is connected to mathematics.

6. He has more glial cells in his brain. Glial cells support nutrition in the brain and help with synthesizing information faster. That is why he can think so powerfully.

7. He started building models and reading books about science, math, and philosophy at a young age.

8. He devotes much of his time to learning and thinking about new things.

"Niggerfaggot" is ok to say because a negative times a negative is a positive. It's just basic math dude. Go back to 7th grade if you don't understand it but I'm going to keep bringing positivity and tolerance to the world with this word.

Petite babe Kylie Page wakes up in the morning after a good dream that has her rubbing her all natural boobs in her sleep. Climbing out of bed, she walks over to the mirror to continue caressing and squeezing her big knockers. Not nearly satisfied with those exploratory touches, she peels off her shirt and her thong. Nude, she returns to bed to wake Bambino up. Rubbing her hand over Bambino’s stiffie, Kylie frees him from his briefs and then leans forward to run her tongue along his shaft. She tastes the head of his dick, and then settles in more. Soon she is licking and sucking Bambino’s balls and hardon, delivering a blowjob with the wet glove of her mouth. When she leans forward to glide her lover’s dick between the bounty of her breasts, Bambino can’t hold back his groan of excitement. Turning the tables on Kylie, Bambino urges his girlfriend onto her back. Then he kisses his way down her body, taking the time to lavish attention on her tender knockers. When he finally reaches her landing strip slit, he flicks out his tongue to tease her clit. Liking the way Kylie squirms, Bambino applies himself to his pussy feast with both his tongue and his fingers working overtime for his lover’s pleasure. Needing more than just Bambino’s fingers inside of her, Kylie climbs onto her hands and knees and turns around so that her plump bottom is there for the taking. Bambino slides balls deep into her greedy twat and then starts stroking. Settling onto a firm rhythm, he milks cries of delight from Kylie with expert strokes of his stiffie. When he cups his hands beneath Kylie’s hanging breasts and slowly urges her up so that her back touches his chest, the new angle of penetration leaves the blonde panting and gasping with need. Knowing how much Bambino loves watching her tatas swing as they fuck, Kylie is happy to impale herself on his fuck stick when he rolls onto his back. Riding him slowly at first, she gradually picks up the pace. It’s not long before Bambino is getting one hell of a show to ratchet up the enjoyment he gets from the delicious friction that Kylie’s every movement creates. When she turns around to ride him in reverse cowgirl, he gets an equally enticing view of her bubble butt jiggling. On her back once again, Kylie watches with enjoyment as Bambino settles his stiffie between her thighs and continues working her towards a big climax. When he lifts both of her thighs for a better angle of penetration, Kylie’s knockers go wild with the force of his thrusts. Kylie knows she’s getting close to cumming, so she reaches down to rub her own clit until she blasts off. Continuing to pound away at Kylie’s creamy warmth, Bambino waits until he can feel his own orgasm about to explode. He pulls out only at the last minute, covering Kylie’s belly with his love. Sated in the aftermath, Kylie can’t keep a cry of delight from passing through her lips when Bambino dives back into her needy muff to lick her to one final climax.

Tonight I dressed up as a character from a show among shows that teaches us to believe and rely solely on science and to disbelief God (Isaiah 46). Well, I decided to shine God's light on it with the reality that God is really real, right now, at every moment, always; I've decided to not be ashamed (Romans 5:5) to fight sin and evil by dressing as the version of ”Rick Sanchez" of earth which God created (the version of earth with which is the only version in existence) who has realized that God in all His miraculous ways (Romans 1:19-20) is truly real, and welcomes the gift of forgiveness and good news of Jesus Christ and everlasting life! This version of Rick realizes only through faith in Jesus Christ, a renewing of the heart and spirit (John 1:1-18, John 3), a confession of the tongue that Jesus has died for our sins and that we deserve every inch of God's wrath (Jeremiah 5, Isaiah 63), and a heartfelt, honest, and true departure from sin. This version of Rick realizes that Jesus is the only one who can fill the empty void we all feel inside, the one who seeks God's glory, not his own. No more silly catch phrases, no more dependence on earthly things, no more false idols and selfishness, no more evil. (Book of Matthew) "The good news of the Gospel is that your sin has already been paid for by the blood of God's Son, Jesus Christ! Now, what's left is to come and receive itl! God is waiting with open arms and wants you to take up your cross and live like Jesus did" Christian Rick “I’M CHRISTIAN RlllCK, AND JESUS IS ENOUGH!!!”

Well, I'm 15. But age is just a number right? Numbers are literally a social concept for those who are too simple to understand the subtle nuances of mathematics within their head, and therefore need external presentations to think for them. Now, if there is anyone, from age 5 (I did algebra at this age) to 90 who has an IQ similar to mine, I would date them. Sexuality is not an issue for me for I am Asexual, however I am very attractive and if I were to be a jock douchebag let's just say I'd be a very successful one. Now you see, the reason 5 isn't too young is because I'm only the 99.999997th percentile IQ. That means there are more like me, however exceptionally rare. If they have a similar IQ, we will get along greet, and they will definitely enjoy similar TV Shows such as Neil DeGrasse Tyson, Bob Ross and Rick and Morty (don't post the fucking copypasta since people are too dumb to grasp the full prowess of the humour that hides behind subtlety and wit of the writers. I'm not making a joke or meme, it's for smart people. Or atleast the "full" show are for those like me). So yeah, that's the range I'd date. Only smart people. I simply cannot deal with the common simpleton as they are too dim to understand my humour, quirkiness or wit.

The Emoji Movie is truly a work of art. It's truly so much deeper than what you see on the surface. The Emoji Movie shows us the terrors of a dystopian society that before this groundbreaking film, we weren't aware of. These emojis are forced to fit society's expectations for their entire lives, and we're abusing our power as the essential gods of the emoji universe. It's sad, but a truth that we need to face. Sony is the only company that's tried to spread awareness about this cause, one of the utmost importance, and for that, they should be respected as gods. I now spend hours worshipping Sony with my enlightened peers. Follow in my footsteps, ducklings. Learn the real horrors of our world and others, and spread this knowledge far and wide. Soon, all will know the true genius of the Emoji Movie.﻿

So, it went like this.

I was out in L.A. once back in 2004. I was born in 1999. Anyways, so i'm out here and I walk into the restroom to use the restroom. So. Like. Here's how it went. Like this. So. Like. 

Long story short - I have always been a big fan of Kendra Wilkinson, before she went off the rails and got ugly. She looked hot as fuck. But her laugh was just, punchable. I ended up running into her out in L.A. She said

"Awww"

"How cutteee" and started to, to do things to me. She touched me.

And I was like

"Mama"

And she "awwed" some more, before she picked me up. I went for a grab @ the tits. She threw me back down and calls me a perv, but not before I chased after her grabbing her ASSets.

Then in 2012 I was out in L.A., and again, I ran into Kim Kardashian but this time I was older. So like, I couldn't get away with things like I used to. YGnomeSayin so, like, I tried acting like I was homeless and asked her for some change. 

Dat didn't work.

So then I just watched her from my cousin's brother's uncle's family friend, long time best pal who also happen to know someone who was a mutual friend of Kanye South's SUV.

She seen me, and then BAM just like that.

She started stripping right there in front of traffic, right there just for me. Peeping George, I mean. Tom.

So.

Like.

Long story short, I got my peter kissed. She said it was like kissing a snake, I asked her if I could balance a glass on her ass. She let me. Then I asked if I could bounce my head on it, she let me do that also.

And then another time, last one, I swear, I'm not that much of a Don Swan.

So, it went like this.

I was at the White House in 2012. And this was, this was scary serious yadigwutimsayin. Because the 1st lady, Melania, was.. oh man. She was looking good this one time.

Long story short, she saw me at the ball dance. I made a joke about my dancing balls, she said she was a nurse practitioner or something, she said I could be cancer (or have cancer, can't remember which). I said her husband wouldn't like that too much. She made a crack about his hair.

Long story short: I clapped some butt-cheeks that night. Like the booty bandit or some shizz. Busting cheeks.

I’m a millennial and posts like this make me sick about millennials and understand why we’re so Entitled and privilege little babies in the eyes of older generations .


Stop reading social media quotes about happiness and passions and watching Hollywood movies and start living in the real world.


I hold a Business Law degree with double minors in Economics and Marketing and work as a Regional Distributor Strategic Manager for the sake of anonymity either Coke or Pepsi. Essentially, I manage the sales of freaking soda for 6 national customers. Do you think this is my life passion? No. You know what is actually - being in your position. An attorney is something I dream of on a daily basis .


At the same time I’m not jeopardizing a life I worked so hard for a “ goal , dream “ BS social media feeds us.


I remember my family immigrated here from a very poor European country and I grew up sleeping in a kitchen on the Same bed with my grandma. I wore one pair of jeans my whole life and most of times I walked to school with my toes sticking out of my shoes.


So I APPRECIATE what I have now. 28 with almost a 6 figure job, no debt, brand new car clothes and a downtown apartment in a major American city.


I didn’t grow up on social media quotes I grew up on hard work , accountability , and responsibility.

Sadly this an very unpopular opinion, and not one that I'll get away with. But I don't care. And I don't care if this offends you. Dank memes are absolutely, insulting retarded and their near constant presence on the Internet is a major part of why I'm embarrassed to even consider myself a user of the web at this point.

They are the ultimate evidence that a majority of my generation is beyond braindead. They consist of extremely stupid images captioned with extremely stupid, predictable and often shamefully distasteful things, mixed with toddler-level slang. And millions of people actually enjoy this. Millions of people, instead of noticing the so very blatant and downright childish inanity of these images, have embraced them to fullest extent, and have all collectively decided that they should be counted as comedy.

The stuff that used to entertain the 12-year olds of the Internet is now entertaining people in the 20s and beyond. What a fucking joke the Internet is nowadays. If dank memes are the kind of thing you funny, you deserve to be insulted and laughed at. You bring it upon yourself. By posting this cancerous trash, you prove your deliberate idiocy. You may as well go and watch Fred or craptastic movies like "The Master Of Disguise".

So go ahead, continue regressing into an infant, continue laughing at retarded faces from popular culture and other stupid shit, continue to laugh at recent tragedies so you can prove how edgy you are. One day you'll look back at your past mental retardation and bury your face in your hands, wondering what the fuck was wrong with you. Oh trust me, you will.

Holy moly, that's quite a pair of titties! Down to the details, they are just amazinf! I mean first, we have just an absolutely perfect round shape with a nice slight perk upwards. Next, we have a beautiful nipple placement, size and color. The titty location and angle on the chest is just outstanding. And lastly we have the overall titty size, looking around D, maybe DD, just a great handful, but not so much that it would sag or be overwhelming.
Overall OP, your tits are a solid 11/10, truly great work here.

* I unsheathe my diamond sword * "You wanna have a bad time, kid ", I whisper under my breath before charging towards you and channeling my chakra. "Underpants SLAM!" I yell, a cryptic reference to Xbox Live Arcade's SpongeBob SquarePants: Underpants Slam, an action puzzle game featuring licensed characters from SpongeBob SquarePants.  I stab my enchanted diamond sword into you, it piercing through your heart. The tip of the diamond sword extends out the other side of your body, having impaled you. "Nothin personnel, kid." I chuckle, raising my leg and kicking you off the rooftop. "Sayanora Shadow the Hedgehog..." I mutter, a reference to Sonic Adventure 2, a platform game developed by Sonic Team and published by Sega in 2001 as a part of the Sonic the Hedgehog series. It is the sequel to Sonic Adventure. I walk off into the darkness, pulling the hood of my minecraft creeper sweatshirt over my head.

Let's start with the fact that Lazy Town is obviously supposed to represent the Capitalist West in socioeconomic decline. Lazy Town is rife with all sorts of social ills-poverty, pollution, unproductivity, unemployment, etc.-and is rapidly stagnating. Mayor Meanswell is clearly supposed to represent the U.S. government-an iron-fisted organization dedicated to the preservation of capitalism in order to preserve its own power. Stingy is a painfully obvious metaphor for the entrenched bourgeoisie doing anything in their power to keep their money. 
Pixel, Ziggy, and Trixie are meant to represent the masses, too enthralled with the bread and circuses provided by Meanswell's regime to see their own enslavement. Robbie Rotten represents Joseph McCarthy and the far right-dedicated completely to the prevention of the International Revolution. Stephanie is supposed to represent allies of Socialism-feminism, suffragism, self-determination, pacifism, etc., and could even be a veiled analogue to Rosa Luxemburg.
And finally, we get to Sportacus.

Sportacus' name is obviously a reference to the Spartakusbund, the forerunner of the German Communist Party led by Karl Liebknecht, Rosa Luxemburg, and Clara Zetkin. Sportacus' moustache is obviously a reference to the moustaches of Leon Trotsky and Liebknecht. He descends from the sky-clear divine imagery-to stimulate the people of Lazy Town into action. He gets them moving-an analogue of a planned economy-and Robbie Rotten opposes him and his socialism, causing a class war which Sportacus always wins. 

Is this all a coincidence? Or has Lazy Town been subliminally encouraging communism amongst our children all this time? I'll let you be the judge.

Adding two instances of the numerical value of two to each other produces the sum of four.
Subtracting one from this sum results in the number three.
I have just demonstrated an example of the study of numbers done in a speedy fashion.

On each passing day the individual is located on the solid cube of hard material.
Ignite large organisms of the plant kingdom on fire and slowly inhale the collection of airborne particulates generated from the combustion.

I watch and observe that individual that identifies as the female gender in the area of natural space set aside for human enjoyment.
After taking everything into consideration I conclude that that particular female is an "uckers".

When the distinct inanimate object generated the sound similar to the sound ducks produce, exactly three times.
You, a male human being, were lowering your body quickly so as to hide yourself.

Human individual that chooses to identify himself as "Azsnee", please wait and do not perform any actions for now.
The fellow person of the male sex is the sole owner of the object I refer to as "pumpee".

Other fellow male human being that I own, please also wait a bit and refrain from doing anything.
The other fellow individual possesses a flat disc-shaped item that can fly long distances in the air when thrown with strength and given a spin.

I proceed to lure an entity into a planted device designed to catch it, three consecutive times.
And I do this on the piece of paved land designed to allow large vehicles to be driven on it.
I transport and set into motion the popular breakfast cereal called "Corn Flakes".

I now randomly mention the name of another well known cereal "Rice Krispies".
Just like I instructed the two previous humans, I also advise you, the person of the female sex that belongs to me, that goes by the name of "Whitney", to stand by and remain in readiness.

While on the paved route I am currently creating ten appendages that typically protrude out of the foot of animals that have feet.
I ask you to please enjoy and be fond of my pedal digits.

You, a masculine adult, held the belief that the water in my body had cooled down and changed its physical state to that of a solid.
I visually perceive a physically attractive female human being which causes me to assume an intentionally seductive body position.

If the said female human is not situated on the thing, then I quickly leave the premises as if I turned into an apparition of a dead person that can appear in the world of the living.
I laugh, but you should also direct your gaze towards the body part responsible for the sense of smell that projects above your mouth.

"Could you please repeat what you said?" I say in a loud manner.
"I choose to equate you with the distal tip of the male sexual organ."
Again, I instruct you to direct your eyes downwards towards the central protruding organ of your face, your nose.

The end-to-end distance of your nose is so long that it can be visually compared to a flexible tube that is used to spray water in a garden.
I now proceed to make an attempt at reproducing the sound that said garden hose makes when active, using my mouth.

I ask you to confirm whether you have in fact succeeded in attaining me.
I try to imitate the sound of a sudden gaseous expansion usually caused by a bomb.
The human person is planning to return back to his internal location.

Could you please divulge your honest opinion on whether you do look on with favor to that?
Also could you please declare whether your bodily senses are perceiving that?

I proclaim that you have in fact done already known all along.
I am visually discerning that your superficial muscles are shaking uncontrollably as if you are frightened.
Please do not react in fear as if you have just witnessed an unexpected event, fellow male member of the Homo sapiens species.
You are currently guaranteed to be safe from any harm, the fact of which is typically referred to as being "protected".
But I also like to add another "ed" syllable at the end of this word.
Affirmative?

I now proceed to mimic the sound produced in a violent explosion.
I present the suggestion that both you and I should depart from the place we're currently residing in.
For a second time I reproduce the sound of a fiery explosion.

Exit the vehicle containing four hinged doorways in one quick maneuver while holding a .44 caliber pistol.
The first four integers in the numeral system were all, in fact, in existence.

The temperature of my body is gradually becoming colder while I'm situated in a long roofed passage inside a building.
The male human individual whose gamete conceived you has been living in this world for at least forty-four years.

This same person is still using a modern telecommunications device to contact another human being and request the artistic production of a picture made with pencil and paper.

Please disclose to your male biological parent what I am about to say next.
As soon as said person falls within my visual field.
I will initiate the action of grabbing and quickly rotating horizontally the mandible bone in the lower part of his face.

I order you to retrieve a chocolate bar going by the name "Twix" belonging to the fellow male individual, using physical violence if necessary.
Please also order this same human to visit an establishment where goods are sold for financial profit, again using physical strength when needed.

The person of the female gender that belongs to you is correctly aware that I have full access to the semi-liquid substance that is typically added to a meal to add flavor.
I do not own any tomato-based condiment however.

It is only the same creamy fluid used for savory dishes that I desire.
This preparation is also pure and not cooked or processed in any way.

Now I'm going to reproduce the sound generated in an explosive blast one more time, say a short slang term used to greet someone or call for attention, and utter the non-existent and meaningless word "gah".

The object without a precise designation, often referred to simply as "thing", but which I pronounce without the letter "h", produces a vast array of sounds that I find very difficult to describe using just the English language. Therefore I am instead going to try to mimic the sounds with my own voice while making convincing gestures using my hands, arms and whole body. The sounds vary from those consisting of just one syllable to more complicated ones that require me to move and slide my tongue along the roof of my mouth very quickly and repeatedly. Some of the sounds resemble those caused by bullet-firing weapons while others are similar to explosive detonations. However, some people would say that they are actually unintelligible words and would classify them as gibberish. I have to admit that one of the reasons I am in fact making all these sounds is to produce a humorous effect by intentionally emphasizing the ridiculousness of it all.

I again repeat the fact that you have done already known.
As a unique individual I choose to identify myself using the name "Big Shaq".

Now I proceed to utter multiple monosyllables that start with the letter "y".

I'd like to inform you that there is a process of rapid oxidation of flammable material under way right now, which is releasing a significant amount of heat and light.
This is happening in the small compartment we are currently inside, and I choose to inform you of this exactly three times.

Could you confirm if you do in fact acquire me?
The male individual belonging to the Homo sapiens species has a temperature value which is not so high that it would cause him discomfort.

I explain this fact to the fellow female person by saying, "The male human does not in fact have a high degree of heat."
Again, I repeat the same thing to the same female, "The individual of the male sex is not perceiving a sensation of great bodily heat."

The human being identifying herself as the female gender requested me to remove my thick outer garment from my body.

I replied to her by saying, "Informal term that literally means a very young toddler but is typically used to describe a good looking female human person, the male individual is in fact not feeling as if his internal body temperature has a significantly high value."

I then proceed to shout "The human being of the male sex cannot ever have a high enough temperature that could cause a sensation similar to that of burning, not now or any other time in the future."

I will now say the formal term that describes the bodily process wherein fluid is produced by sweat glands in the skin of most mammals and is then left to evaporate, with the result of heat being dissipated off the animal's body.
I have also decided to add the slang term "ting" right after.

Next, I will mention the name of the brand "Lynx" that, among other products, manufactures several types of deodorants which are used to cut down on the unpleasant body odors that can be caused by excessive sweating.
I will also say the English word that describes a change which is a result of a previously performed action.

My dick has been stuck in my USB port for the past 2 days. I was watching a robux tutorial on YouTube when then all of a sudden, my cock was wedged tightly into the USB port, I think I got confused with one of the steps in the tutorial and I so happened to of got my penis jammed into that USB port. I just recently ate the rest of my ramen stash beside my desk and finished watching my favorite anime series, Boko No Pico. I have only a few days to live after my Roblox account is suspended, please help me with my problem I have been facing for the past few days. And before you ask, yes I have no butter, I used it a few weeks ago during a minecraft sex animation on my favorite website, Lemonparty. What I used it for is between me and myself, but please help me, I really want to get back to my lesbian elf hentai stash I've been keeping in my bathroom for the past few days. Thanks in advanced, Jerry the dwarf enslaver. XOXO

What the fuck did you just fucking say about EA, you little bitch? I’ll have you know they won first place in the GOTY of 2017 for Star Wars Battlefront 2, and I’ve been involved in multiple of their booths at E3, and I have over 300 confirmed kills in BF2. EA is trained with fair microtransactions, lootboxes and is the top video game company in the world. Your nintendo gay-ms are nothing to me but just TRASH. I will wipe you out with precision the likes of which has never been seen before on this Earth, mark my words. You think you can get away with saying shit to me over the Internet? Think again, fucker. As we speak I am purchasing all the content in your p2w games of which the likes of you mongrels can't afford. I'm the storm that wipes out the pathetic little thing you call your career. You’re fucking dead, kid. I can be anywhere, anytime, and I can beat you in over seven hundred ways, and that’s just with my paid content. Not only have I paid over 1000$ for the other 99% of BF2, but I have the money to beat you with each and every character in any of your p2w games and I will use my wallet to its full extent to wipe your ass off the face of the continent, you little shit. If only you could have known what unholy retribution your little “clever” comment was about to bring down upon you, maybe you would have held your tongue. You didn’t, and now you’re paying the price, you goddamn idiot. I will shit all over you and you will drown in it. You’re gonna git wrecked, kiddo.

Why are you so over-critical of a post? I swear, this has to be one of the most annoying trends nowadays. I am actually enraged by what goes through that brain of yours. This comment is truly a disgrace to humanity. Yeah, instead of appreciating the humor of a post (which is the sub is intended for, I already reported you to the moderators), you choose to get in the way of your own enjoyment and criticize OP. How do you think OP feels right now? Well, you probably would not know, because you seem to lack self-awareness, but I will tell you this: If you continue your rude ways, no one will ever like you. You have been warned. For this comment, I will award you a downvote.

Whenever I feel like cutting, I watch Caillou because doing so is essentially self harm. God I hate it so much, with Caillou always whining and throwing temper tantrums and his parents never giving any fucks because their bald paradise probably has cancer. I've been clean from cutting for nearly 1 month thanks to this show. The scars that Caillou leaves are only visible in my dreams.

As someone with 2,000+ hours, I can comfortably say that there is some sort of active cult following the TF2 forums and numerous other TF2 related places. Literally all it takes is a few well thought out complaints to get all the pyro mains to start flocking in like zombies. They had an active propaganda to make people think the class was "garbage" and "useless" which lead to an update to make him even more OP, gimmicky, and unbalanced. And guess what? These people who have claimed that Pyro was a "useless" class? They're Pyro mains, or at least, their top 3 most played classes usually include Pyro. Imagine my fucking shock. It's laughable, really. Imagine "maining" a class only to turn around and unironically say it's broken. It's like dominating an entire server as Soldier and then proceeding to complain how underpowered he is. Except with Pyro, there's an entire cult that's been brainwashed into believing it and taking it to their grave. One common trope I see among this shallow-minded "cult" is that they're usually weaboos, furries. These communities are known for sticking together like cement. Considering the TF dev team dedicated an entire update to this shitty unbalanced class just to make it even more shitty and unbalanced, it pretty much proves that the future of TF2 is shit

If you enjoy eating pussy, you are probably gay
The clitoras is essentially biologically undeveloped penis, if you get pleasure from doing this it is the inner gay you releasing dopamine in your brain.

If you hate it, but do it for your ladies pleasure, well done, but you are still sucking caveman micropenis.

Likewise, if your girl likes licking your nipples, she would prefer to be with a girl. Time to pitch for the threesome quickly before she ditches yo ass and buys some dungarees

Ok, is this a video game reference? I've never really been into video games, so can you please explain what you're saying here? Is this like some type of weird life-simulating-game social thing you're acting out with your fellow video gamers here? I mean, I like books, personally (you know, where things that are mentioned actually have an impact on how the story progresses (that's a sign of intelligence on the part of the author because it demonstrates cohesive, forward thinking (and on the reader's behalf if they can figure out these patterns as well (but I suppose it may not be as common with gamers if they're not used to having some plot point or event, etc., progressing the story (but then I can't blame them for their ignorance if they don't have the exposure (I'm pretty fair about this)))))). So can you please explain this? Sorry if this seems intrusive or condescending; I certainly don't mean it that way: I'm just trying to provide my own perspective and understand yours. People always downplot me without answering my actual question. Thank you in advance.

**EDIT: to those downclobbering: you may disagree with me, but allow me to remind you "Redditors" that downclobbering for disagreeing with someone goes against the Reddiquette Policy of Reddit.

Fuck you fucking what to say about me, your little bitch? I will let you know that I am a top mariner of the Marine Corps. I have been involved in many secret attacks on Al-Qaida, and I have killed more than 300 people. I train in the gorilla war, I am the highest sniper of the entire US military. You do not have anything to me, just another goal. I will clean you with the exact things that I have never seen on this earth, these marks are my fucking. Do you think you can avoid saying shit to me on the internet? Think again, stupid. As we said, I am contacting my network of spies in the United States and your intellectual property is being tracked so you are better prepared to greet this storm, maggot. This storm erases what you call poor little things. You fucking dead, kid. I can kill you anywhere, anytime, I can use more than 700 ways, it's just my bare hands. Not only have I received extensive training in defenseless battles, but I also have access to the entire arsenal of U.S. marines, and I will make full use of it to wipe out the traumatic buttocks on the continent. If only you can know what an evil revenge, then your little "clever" commentary will come to you, maybe you will put your tongue.

*There.*

My eagle eyes spot a glorious specimen of femininity attempting to pump her own gas. This is unacceptable, and must be stopped.

I do a triple backflip to her location, holding my fedora to prevent it from falling off, and bodycheck the delicate waif. As she sprawls on the ground, I manage to grab her MasterCard -- I wear fingerless gloves for the extra dexterity -- and slip it into the slot.

The distressed damsel attempts to stand, although her newly injured hip makes this difficult. I grab the wound with my right hand to stanch the bleeding while I expertly select super-premium gasoline (only the best for milady!) with my left.

"Hey," the dame sputters weakly. She's trying to thank me, but she's probably going into shock.

"Don't speak, m'lady," I rumble masculinely as I whip the gas nozzle into the car port. She's getting in the way a bit -- probably trying to help, as though she could, poor thing -- so I lift her up by the hip and deposit her on the roof of her car. As the gas pumps, I cut off a strip of my trench coat with my all-purpose katana as a makeshift bandage for milady's injury.

"Please... don't do that," the womanfolk whispers weakly. She doesn't know what she's saying; her feeble wits must have been addled by the fall. I smile beatifically and apply the bandage to the fairer sex's thigh, tying it expertly with a knot I learned in *Survivalism for Dummies*.

I hear the gas nozzle click, signalling the car is filled. That didn't take long. It's probably because milady drives a tiny womanly vehicle with a tiny womanly gas tank. I replace the nozzle and remove the MasterCard.

"Your husband should pay for your gas," I say reprovingly, shaking the card at milady, and I pocket it for her own good. With that, I execute a flying leap back to my perch on top of the Cumby's, letting the warm glow of chivalry fill my heart.

I have said it before, I will say it again, and again. Downvote me all you want PR EA accounts and enablers:

Fuck lootboxes, fuck microtransactions, fuck pay2win, fuck incomplete excuses for AAA games, fuck EA, fuck lootboxes creeping into every single player experience, fuck shark cards, fuck Take2, fuck the grindfests, fuck Blizzard for normalizing loot crates with Overwatch, fuck this trend of splitting a complete game into initial game + 50 dlcs + eternal grind to fatten the shareholders pockets as they sit on their yachts laughing about the mindless open wallet slot machine that the average gamer is.

Now that thats out of the way: Fuck the enables. No. Seriously. You people who in every new iteration of cashgrabs fill the reddit and other forums threads with "but this time it'll be different! They promised!", "shut up, I dont want to hear about it, just pay or stfu", "this aint so bad", "microtransactions, lootboxes are okay as long as they promise to keep them cosmetic". FUCK HAVING THE MEMORY OF A GOLDFISH. Fuck you enablers. Why fuck you? Because you are literally working together with these scumbag corporations that could care fuckall about us consumers by lowering the quality of every new game that is coming out. Yes, fucking believe me, the bar is being lowered for what these days is acceptable as a AAA release. If you would go back in time 10 years, explain to someone the actual piece of shit excuse for a AAA title that we are getting these days, THE PEOPLE WOULD LAUGH AND NOT BELIEVE YOU. THATS HOW BAD IT IS.

As long as people continue to defend and buy this garbage we have ended up now having as AAA titles, NOTHING WILL CHANGE. SO STOP FUCKING DEFENDING IT BECAUSE YOU ARE PLAYING INTO THE HANDS OF THE DISGUSTING CORPORATIONS BY LOWERING THE BAR OF QUALITY WHILE RAISING THE BAR ON JUST HOW MUCH WE ACCEPT BEING FUCKED IN THE ASS. THE MORE WE ACCEPT THE WORSE THE NEXT ITERATION WILL BE. THEY ARE JUST TESTING HOW MUCH WE CAN TAKE WHILE STILL STAYING AND PAYING.
Sorry but totally fuck this. FUCK GAMERS because you all arent stand up consumers, everyone in every other business and industry is laughing at JUST HOW BAD YOU ARE AT EXCERCISING YOUR CONSUMER RIGHTS, fuck defending to be fucked in the ass just because you are sick of hearing about it. Fuck being a consumer and not standing up for your consumer rights. Fuck accepting that they lowered the bar of AAA games so much that we sit here 10 years later wondering how much the games will SUCK instead of wondering how much they will ROCK like we are supposed to. Fuck accepting a shitty state because its norm and you are annoyed by the people who dare to voice their opinion against this abuse. What the fuck kind of exercising of consumer rights is that?!

I see reddit threads FILLED with people saying "it aint so bad, at least this one only has cosmetic lootboxes!" and "oh look a whole 8 hours campaign!". Well where the fuck are we next year? "At least in this one I only had to 40 hours to unlock a character!" - wait scratch that, THAT IS ACTUALLY WHERE WE ARE NOW WHAT THE FUCK. 
Whether its EA, Ubisoft, Take2, Bethesda fucking you as the consumer: FUCK YOU FOR DEFENDING IT, YOU ARE ONLY MAKING THE PRODUCT WORSE FOR ALL OF US IN THE LONG RUN. FUCK this juvenile neglect towards literally the most important thing in a consumer market: TO FUCKING DEMAND BETTER PRODUCTS. Burn this post, ban me do what you want at least for GODS SAKE be a respectable consumer and START DEMANDING BETTER PRODUCTS. IT ISN'T OKAY TO TREAT THE CUSTOMER THIS WAY IN ANY OTHER INDUSTRY OR BUSINESS SO WHY IS IT IN GAMING?

[31mJapan deserves nothing except our eternal gratitude for creating anime. It is essentially the only media currently existing that has a transcendental value, or is brimming with subtle emotion. The aesthetic employed within it is so often taken from european culture, and there's so many stories that deal with european mythology or are inspired by white civilization. But even when an anime deals exclusively with japanese culture, the emotional resonance is there. Why? Because the root of both the japanese and whites is the same. What is this root? Is it something immaterial like a soul, a word of God that materialized and solidified in both our cultures and psyches? Or is it just the end result of racial purity? I don't know. But I do know that anime has provided a glimpse into that which both races and cultures dreamed off and desired for aeons.
Anime is the ONLY form of entertainment suitable for consumption if you are a self-respecting white male. And as time goes on we can see the divide between those who have taste and those who do not, and I'm glad we're having this divide. Anime is the high culture of the 20th and 21st century, something that is a genuine creative effort devoid of dubious ideologies. It is a piece of eternity given to us and expressed by us. It is OUR artform and OUR defiance to the filth of movies, actors, celebrities and the whole Western media apparatus. It eclipsed them completely. It rendered them obsolete.

Where I'm from, and when I grew up, a faggot or fag was another word for an "annoying cunt". Such as biker fag, or surfer fag, or ufc fag, or gamer fag.
But you must be one of these "liberals" who takes offense whenever the opportunity arises.
To answer your question: No, you faggot, I don't have to be homophobic but if it would loosen up your asshole so you can get that stick a little further up, I'd be more than happy to."

[31mLet me just cut to the chase. Sportacus has a Number 10 on his shirt, a small detail that most viewers will probably forget. However, it has stated that the Number Ten means something, but I'll get to that later. Let's start with the first episode of LazyTown. A brief summary of it is that Stephanie, the main character, moves into LazyTown to visit her uncle, Mayor Milford Meanswell. She meets other kids in the town, Trixie, Stingy, Pixel, and Ziggy, who's personalities are identical to their name. Robbie Rotten is also there in his secret lair, keep note of this, He looks around the town to see weeds, an abandoned basketball court, and other very polluted things. He seems content about this, proclaiming he will keep LazyTown the laziest town on the world. Later on, Stephanie talks to her uncle about how none of the kids want to go outside to play. Her uncle then tells her that there was a man with a Number 9 on his shirt, who made kids active. Wait, 9? But Sportacus has Number 10 on his shirt! Was this careless mistake? Or something more different? Stephanie makes a letter to said person, and goes to the mailbox to send it. She finds a cork inside the tube and tries pulling it out. Robbie is then shown stopping in his tracks and is visibly distraught about this, meaning he knows what is going to happen when she sends that letter. She pulls the cork out and puts the tube like envelope into the pipe, and it soon gets launched into the sky, and is received by Sportacus. Sportacus jumps down to meet Stephanie, she asks him if he is Number 9 and he responds with that he is Number 10. Robbie than says "Another one?" Confirming the fact that there was a Number 9, and Robbie fought him aswell. Think about it, at the start of the episode Robbie already has his signature secret lair. However, he doesn't use it for evil, he doesn't terrorize the citizens of LazyTown, he likes the citizens how they are, lazy. So, why would he have this lair, unless he had to use it against Number 9? Then the question remains, where is Number 9? Did he leave? Did he accomplish his goal, move away and then Robbie made it lazy again? Or did Robbie Rotten beat Number 9? Think about it, why would he use the schemes he uses on Sportacus and friends if they didn't prove successful against Number 9? So we got that Robbie Rotten beat Number 9 and made LazyTown lazy, but that also strikes up another question. Are there more numbers? Are Number 9 and Sportacus apart of a group that ride blimps and help make kids exercise and play outside? Now are you ready for the biggest stretch in this entire theory? Robbie Rotten was the first Sportacus-like member of this group. Why so? Well Robbie admits it himself. In a little known song called "We Are number one"﻿

[31mGood morning, everyone.

My name is Pastor Dr. Martin Sempa. I'm here in the capacity of the chariman of the national task force against homosexuality in Uganda.

We are making legislation to make sure that sodomy and homosexuality never sees the light of legality in this land of the part of Africa. I've taken time to do a little research to know what homosexuals do in the privacy of their bedroom. One of the thing they do is called anal licking, where the-, a man's anus is licked, like this, by the other person. Like ice cream. And then what happens, even poo-poo comes out. The other poo-poos out. And then they eat the poo-poo. The other one they do, is they have a sex practice called fisting where they insert their hand into the other man's hand and it goes all the-, into the anus all the way, and it is so painful they have to take drugs. But they enjoy it. Now if we have any children, please step out. This is a parental guidance moment. That child can be moved out. So, I've done research. This is what they do: Number one, you can see a man here having sucked the other person's rectum and the other person is poo-pooing, and this one is eating the poo-poo all over the place. Tell me, when you have a law against homosexuality do you say accept eating poo-poo? I mean look at these guyses here. Bishop. Aaaah, stagafiliza. Huh? Hajat? We do not want this sickness. This is sick, and it's therefore deviant; we do not want it.

Now, they start off by touching each other's genitals and smearing each other. Then this one smears the poo-poo all over the other person's face. As if that is not enough he puts the hand deep. As Africans we want to ask Barrack Obama to explain to us, is this what he wants to bring to Africa? As a human right to eat the poo-poo of our children?

[31mOllie the furry is 40 years old, lives in their mom's basement and is surrounded by jars of piss, feces and semen. They're diagnosed with terminal 7 autism and PTSD after coming back from the great war in 'nam. They resorted to furry porn as their retreat from the harsh cruelness of the reality that they were exposed to in the fields of Vietnam, taking men's lives with the pull of a trigger and leaving them to die in the middle of a cold, muddy battlefield, soiled in their own blood, and the events that followed upon his arrival back home.

Scarred for life after the war, they returned home to be greeted with open arms by their loving wife and kids, but that wasn't enough to consolidate him; they were empty inside, cold from their longing for love in a desolate place devoid of any such thing. Not even the sweet embrace of his loved ones could bring him back from the Hell on Earth his soul still resided in. He was a shell of his former self.

Olliver was scared, frightened. he couldn't handle even walking out into the middle of the streets, let alone his own backyard, knowing he was on the same levels as a cold-blooded killer. He resorted to drug abuse, overdosing on cocaine, crack and steroids, getting pleasure from chemical highs as his brain rotted away, along with the guilt of war. It wasn't long before he needed to stop, before it was too late and he tore both his family and his own life apart.

But it was too late. He had broken down, he lost his job at the local grocer after becoming exceedingly violent towards patrons and other staff, and raped his 7 year old daughter whilst high on drugs. He was arrested, undoubtedly, days later for sexual assault, rape, child abuse, pedophilia and acts of violence. Many years passed; he was released from jail, his family was torn apart and he became the sole occupant of his deceased mother's house. He discovered the online community of furries, where he could remain anonymous and was welcomed with open arms. He became highly obsessed with everything to do with furries, even attending a few conventions in his own hand-made fur suits he had sewn with supplies he bought on the dole.

His family despised him, he was no longer considered any part of their family any more. To this day, as he roleplays online as his fursona Ollie the Fox, the last words he ever heard from his wife still ring out in his ears, those sweet, bitter words and her broken down, shivering figure. He remembers how utterly shocked and vulgar she was, lashing out with every ounce in her frail body, screaming at him with pure hatred. He remembers the trickling tears in her eyes, as his wife said, "You're movin' with your auntie and uncle in Bel-Air."

I begged and pleaded with her day after day
But she packed my suitcase and sent me on my way
She gave me a kiss and then she gave me my ticket.
I put my Walkman on and said, "I might as well kick it."

First class, yo, this is bad
Drinking orange juice out of a champagne glass.
Is this what the people of Bel-Air living like?
Hmm, this might be alright.

But wait I hear they're prissy, bourgeois, all that
Is this the type of place that they just send this cool cat?
I don't think so
I'll see when I get there
I hope they're prepared for the prince of Bel-Air

Well, the plane landed and when I came out
There was a dude who looked like a cop standing there with my name out
I ain't trying to get arrested yet
I just got here
I sprang with the quickness like lightning, disappeared

I whistled for a cab and when it came near
The license plate said "Fresh" and it had dice in the mirror
If anything I could say that this cab was rare
But I thought, "Nah, forget it."
– "Yo, home to Bel-Air."

I pulled up to the house about 7 or 8
And I yelled to the cabbie, "Yo home smell ya later."
I looked at my kingdom
I was finally there
To sit on my throne as the Prince of Bel-Air

[31mTo be fair, you don't need to have a very high IQ to understand Rick and Morty. The humour is subtle at times but it is still filled with jokes for casual viewers. There is no need to have a grasp of physics theories as most jokes are based on the In universe physics established by the show. There’s also Rick’s nihilistic outlook, that Rick did justify in the episode in which he turns into a pickle, but the other characters are also right in resenting his negative outlook. People who dislike Rick & Morty truly ARE people with different tastes. I laugh at most of the show's jokes and think that the show can be really smart at times but I can understand why some people don't like it.

And yes, by the way, i don't have a Rick & Morty tattoo. As I like to donate blood regularly.

[31mI cannot think or comprehend of anything more cucked than having a daughter. Honestly, think about it rationally. You are feeding, clothing, raising and rearing a girl for at least 18 years solely so she can go and get ravaged by another man. All the hard work you put into your beautiful little girl - reading her stories at bedtime, making her go to sports practice, making sure she had a healthy diet, educating her, playing with her. All of it has one simple result: her body is more enjoyable for the men that will eventually fuck her in every hole.

Raised the perfect girl? Great. Who benefits? If you're lucky, a random man who had nothing to do with the way she grew up, who marries her. He gets to fuck her tight pussy every night. He gets the benefits of her kind and sweet personality that came from the way you raised her.

As a man who has a daughter, you are LITERALLY dedicating at least 20 years of your life simply to raise a girl for another man to enjoy. It is the ULTIMATE AND FINAL cuck. Think about it logically.

[31mSluts, sluts, I fuck sluts.
Sluts get fucked when I fuck sluts.
No if's, and's or but's. I fuck sluts.
I fuck sluts. Nice girls are nice but no good for nut-sucking,
You'll need a serene night to green-light a butt fucking,
But that'll be easy with sleazy old slut fucking.
Boo to the nice girls. Praise be to slut fucking!
I have a list. A list? Yes a list of all the sluts I've missed.
I've never fucked or sucked these sluts and thus my nuts are fucking pissed.
So when I fuck the lucky slut my nut removes her from the list.
Another dumb cum-bucket struck from my nut sucking,
Suck it slut, slut fucking bucket-list.
Sluts can be white, black, brown, pink, or almond.
They can be skinny with big tits or be skinny with small ones.
Sluts can be perky, preppy or posh with their brains and their clothes all shrunk from the wash.
But other sluts are pretty and funny and smart.
These sluts can lift all your thoughts from your dick to your heart.
They can talk about science, music, or art.
They can put you together or they can pull you apart.
But don't trust these sluts, don't, don't you dare.
They'll force you to trust them and love them and care.
And then they'll be gone and then you'll be aware
Of that hole in your heart that that dumb slut left there

Japan deserves nothing except our eternal gratitude for creating anime. It is essentially the only media currently existing that has a transcendental value, or is brimming with subtle emotion. The aesthetic employed within it is so often taken from european culture, and there's so many stories that deal with european mythology or are inspired by white civilization. But even when an anime deals exclusively with japanese culture, the emotional resonance is there. Why? Because the root of both the japanese and whites is the same. What is this root? Is it something immaterial like a soul, a word of God that materialized and solidified in both our cultures and psyches? Or is it just the end result of racial purity? I don't know. But I do know that anime has provided a glimpse into that which both races and cultures dreamed off and desired for aeons.

Anime is the ONLY form of entertainment suitable for consumption if you are a self-respecting white male. And as time goes on we can see the divide between those who have taste and those who do not, and I'm glad we're having this divide. Anime is the high culture of the 20th and 21st century, something that is a genuine creative effort devoid of dubious ideologies. It is a piece of eternity given to us and expressed by us. It is OUR artform and OUR defiance to the filth of movies, actors, celebrities and the whole Western media apparatus. It eclipsed them completely. It rendered them obsolete.

The problem is that when the subject of troll romance is broached, our sparing human intellects instantly assume the most ingratiating posture of surrender imaginable. 

But we will do our best to understand regardless. 

Humans have only one form of romance. And though we consider it a complicated subject, spanning a wide range of emotions, social conventions, and implications for reproduction, it is ultimately a superficial slice of what trolls consider the full body of romantic experience. Our concept of romance, in spite of its capacity to fill our art and literature and to rule our individual destinies like little else, is still just that. A single, linear concept. A concept usually denoted by a single symbol. 

<3 

Troll romance is more complicated than that. Troll romance needs four symbols. 

Their understanding of romance is divided into halves, and halved again, producing four quadrants: the FLUSHED QUADRANT, the CALIGINOUS QUADRANT, the PALE QUADRANT, and the ASHEN QUADRANT. 

Each quadrant is grouped by the half they share, whether horizontally or vertically, depending on the overlapping properties one examines. The sharpest dichotomy, from an emotional perspective, is drawn between RED ROMANCE and BLACK ROMANCE. 

RED ROMANCE, comprised of the flushed and pale quadrants, is a form of romance rooted in strongly positive emotions. BLACK ROMANCE, with its caliginous and ashen quadrants, is rooted in the strongly negative. 

On the other hand, the vertical bifurcation has to do with the purpose of the relationship, regardless of the emotions behind it. Those quadrants which are CONCUPISCENT, the flushed and caliginous, have to do with facilitating the elaborate reproductive cycle of trolls. Those which are CONCILIATORY, the pale and ashen, would be more closely likened to platonic relationships by human standards. 

There are many parallels between human relationships and the various facets of troll romance. Humans have words to describe relationships of a negative nature, or of a platonic nature. The difference is, for humans, those relationships would never be conceptually grouped with romance. Establishing those sort of relationships for humans is not driven by the same primal forces that drive our tendency to couple romantically. But for trolls, those primal forces involve themselves in the full palette of these relationships, red or black, torrid or friendly. Trolls typically feel strongly compelled to find balance in each quadrant, and seek gratifying relationships that each describes. 

The challenge is particularly tortuous for young trolls, who must reconcile the wide range of contradictory emotions associated with this matrix, while understanding the nature of their various romantic urges for the first time. 

Of course, young humans have this challenge too. But for trolls, the challenge is fourfold. 

When two individuals find themselves in the flushed quadrant together, they are said to be MATESPRITS. Matespritship is the closest parallel to the human concept of romance trolls have. It plays a role in the trolls' reproductive cycle, just as it does for humans. 

This is pretty obvious! Not much more needs to be said about this. Moving right along. 

When a pair of adversaries delve into this quadrant, they become each other's KISMESIS. As one of the concupiscent quadrants, it plays a role in procreation as well. There is no particularly good human translation for this concept. The closest would be an especially potent arch-rivalry. 

For instance, human players would never be able to adequately diagnose the relationship between the queen and her archagent. But troll players could immediately place it as a dead ringer for kismesissitude. They would think we were all pretty stupid for not getting it. And they would be right. 

Trolls have a complicated reproductive cycle. It's probably best not to examine it in much detail. 

The need to seek out concupiscent partners comes with more urgency than typical reproductive instincts. When the IMPERIAL DRONE comes knocking, you had better be able to supply genetic material to each of his FILIAL PAILS. If you have nothing to offer, he will kill you without hesitation. 

The genetic material - WITHOUT GOING INTO MUCH DETAIL - is a combinative genetic mix from the matesprit and kismesis pairs, respectively. The pails are all offered to the mother grub, who can only receive such precombined material. She then combines all of it into one incestuous slurry, and begins her brooding. 

This doesn't mean the initial combination was for naught, however. In the slurry, more dominant genes rise to the fore, while the more recessive find less representation in the brood. Especially strong matesprit and kismesis pairings yield more dominant genetic material. The more powerful the complement or potent the rivalry, the more dominant the genes. 

TROLL REPRODUCTION SURE IS WEIRD. We all take a moment to lament how pedestrian the human reproductive system is, and further lament that the phrase "incestuous slurry" is not a feature of common parlance in human civilization. 

This quadrant involves a particular type of three-way relationship of a black romantic nature. Falling on the conciliatory side, it has no bearing on the reproductive cycle, except for indirect ramifications. 

When two trolls are locked in a feud or some otherwise contentious relationship, one can intervene and become their AUSPISTICE. The auspistice mediates between the two, playing the role of a peace keeper, preventing the feud from boiling over into a fully caliginous rivalry. 

Since such lesser feuds are quite common among trolls, there is a significant need for auspisticing parties. Without them, too many ashen feuds would become caliginous, and begin to conflict with other exclusive kismesis relationships, leading to a great deal of social complexity and sore feelings (even more so than black romance usually involves). Without auspisticism, the result would be widespread black infidelity. 

The relationships each quadrant describes tend to be malleable, if not volatile, especially on the concupiscent half where more torrid emotions reside. It doesn't take much to flip a switch and transmute blackrom feelings to redrom, and vice versa. 

In many cases, one party will have red feelings while the other has black. But it will often be the case that one party's feelings will swap to match the other's, since there is no quadrant which naturally accommodates such a disparity. But thereafter, it's not uncommon for the two to toggle between red and black in unison now and then. These scenarios naturally result in both red and black infidelities. 

This sort of relationship volatility is why conciliatory relationships are an important part of troll romance. 

An auspistice can stabilize particularly turbulent relationships. If the auspistice fails to mediate properly, or has no interest in the role, or perhaps has different romantic intentions him/herself altogether, then the relationship often quickly deteriorates into one of an especially hostile and torrid nature. There are many outside factors and influences tugging and pulling these relationships in different directions, and unlike humans who have very orderly, simple, straightforward romantic relationships without exception, trolls exist in a state of almost perpetual confusion and generally have no idea what the hell is going on. 

Being confused by troll relationships is one thing we do have in common though. 

This quadrant presides over MOIRALLEGIENCE, the other conciliatory relationship. A reasonable human translation would be the concept of a soul mate, but in a more platonic sense, and with a more specific social purpose. 

Trolls are a very angry and violent race. Some are more hot-tempered and dangerous than others, to the extent that if left to their own devices, they would present a serious threat to society, or even to themselves. Such trolls will have an instinctive pale attraction to a more even-tempered troll, who may become their MOIRAIL. The moirail is obliged to pacify the other, to function as the better half. The two partners in a strong pale relationship will serve to balance and complement each other's emotional profiles, and thus allow their other relationships to be more successful. 

It's often ambiguous especially among young trolls whether a bond formed between an acquaintance is true moirallegence, or the usual variety of platonic involvement. Furthermore, romantic intentions of a more flushed nature can often be mistaken for paler leanings, much to the frustration of the suitor. 

But some pale pairings, as the one above, will be strikingly obvious to all who know them. 

God you just can't get enough of this can you! That would have been a great point for a transition out of this illustrated sociological study, but ok, if you insist. 

Now see, what's going on here is... 

It's perfectly simple. When the full matrix of troll romance is in action, we have... uh... 

Hey, why don't you figure it out! You should be an expert on all this by now anyway. 

Later our troll hero would try to explain this to our human hero, attempting to convey all the nuance of troll romance through a nearly verbatim recitation of the preceding excerpts. 

He would try to describe how rich and textured the troll romantic comedies were compared to the one dimensional schlock of our human cinematic counterparts. He would barely scratch the surface of Troll Will Smith's virtuosity with the delicate lattice of troll romance, as he would assist the bumbling fudgeblooded Troll Kevin James through the interwoven minefield-briarpatch of redrom and blackrom entanglements, all the while sifting through his own prickly romantic situation and ultimately learning the true meaning of hate and pity. But would they succeed before the imperial drone came knocking with his thirsty pails at the ready??? Yes, they would. 

But John didn't understand any of this because he's a moron, and he wouldn't shut up about his awful bullshit Earth movies. He would just go on and on and on about that garbage. 

But if there was one theme to be hammered through his thick skull, it would be the trolls' cultural preoccupation with romantic destiny. Yes, the romantic landscape is rife with false starts and miscues and infidelities, red and black. But every troll believes strongly that each quadrant holds one and only one true pairing for them, and it is just a matter of time before the grid is filled with auspicious matchups through the mysterious channels of TROLL SERENDIPITY. 

In short, their belief is that for each quadrant there exists a pair or triad of trolls somewhere in the cosmos that were... 

MADE FOR EACH OTHER.

Armchair Developer is a shitty argument made by people who don't like when people criticise or talk about something, but can't come up with a good counter argument. So instead they try and make the argument invalid through other means. In this case by trying to say people speaking on the issue are not qualified to speak on it and that it's easy to criticise from the comfort of your own armchair (i.e there is no risk for you).

For instance Armchair politician gets used a lot when people talk about politics leading up to elections. It's basically saying "You aren't a politician, you don't know what it's like to be a politician, so you can't speak on the issue". It's a dumb argument considering you don't require any qualification or experience to be a politician. The only thing a politician may have over the average joe is extra information.

In the case of Armchair developer they are saying you aren't a developer so how can you say what is a good and a bad decision for a game. Except the whole argument falls a part if you think about it for even a second. For one you could make the exact same argument about game reviewers, many of whom are not game developers, yet their job is ultimately to tell you if a game is good or bad. Secondly, games are dependant on customers buying them. What is good and bad in a game is ultimately decided by whether the customers buy the games, not the developers. There is an element of truth in "customers don't know what they want" however that isn't always true.

It makes even less sense here since the problem isn't with the gameplay itself, it's with the economy that surrounds that gameplay. Armchair economist would be a more apt (but equally shitty) argument.

Men scare me more and more each day. I'm 23 and have never been friends with one or worked with one and it honestly makes me so happy. I can't think of being friends with men. It scares me to think about being alone with one because they could so easily hurt me. I just hate jews so much now. There's just so many men violent offenders

I like good pizza and I like good cheese  
Eat so much pizza you wouldn't believe  
And I get more pizza than pizza hut  
  

2 to the 1 to the 1 to the 3  
I met a bad pizza last night at the pizza hut  
Let me tell you how I consumed the pizza  
mastication and extra grease  
  
I've been to the motherfrickin' Chuck E. Cheese  
Heard motherfrickers eat pizza, seen 'em die due to lactose intolerance  
If I ain't got a food I'll pick up a pizza pie  
And when I eat the pizza I'm gon' continue to eat more pizza  
  
Get your buttocks off the seat with your two left feet  
It's real cheesy, just follow the beat  
Don't let that fine pie pass you by  
Look real close, ‘cause PIZZA PIE  
  
We about to have a party (A Pizza Party)  
Let's get it started (Go 'head, eat the pizza)  
I'm looking for a girl with a body that is not lactose intolerant  
Wanna get some pizza, baby? Cheese right up  
  
Some girls they act special  
Some girls are 'bout the cheese  
I'm looking for a girl that will eat any pizza  
I say, every day she be consuming pizza  
  
Eat that cheese for me, Eat that cheese for me  
Come on, girl, Eat that cheese for me, Eat that cheese for me  
Ohh, girl, Eat that cheese for me, Eat that cheese for me  
Come on, girl, Eat that cheese for me, Eat that cheese for me  
  
I'm a menace, a pizza eater, a known pizza eater  
Open your mouth for about four or five minutes  
Take a little bit of this delicious cheesy pizza  
Swish, but don't spit it; swallow it, now finish the delcious pizza  
  
Yeah, me and Nate D-O Pizza-G  
Looking for a couple bitches with some money to buy pizza  
Pop a little hot wings and pizza  
Slip it in her mouth, as she enjoys pizza  
  
We about to have a party (A Pizza Party)  
Let's get it started (Go 'head, eat the pizza)  
I'm looking for a girl with a body that is not lactose intolerant

Some girls they act special  
Some girls are 'bout the cheese  
I'm looking for a girl that will eat any pizza  
I say, every day she be consuming pizza  
  
Now look at this lady all in front of me  
Cheesy as can be  
Tonight I want a pizza eater, would you be mine?  
Heard you was cheesy from a friend of mine  
  
Now, I hope you don't get mad at me  
But I told Nate you was a pizza eater  
He said he wants a cheese masticator, hope you don't mind  
I told him how you like it from the mouth, entrance to the digestive system.  
  
Eat that cheese for me, Eat that cheese for me  
Come on, girl, Eat that cheese for me, Eat that cheese for me  
Ohh, girl, Eat that cheese for me, Eat that cheese for me  
Come on, girl, Eat that cheese for me, Eat that cheese for me

I'm looking for a girl that will eat any pizza  
I say, every day she be consuming pizza   
  
There she go, shaking that cheese on the floor  
Carelessely allowing the cheese to slide off of the pizza  
The way she just allowed it to happen
I think she's not a true pizza lover  
  
God! I am leaving without you  
You're never coming near me  
And my pizza, and their pizza kids, again  
Haha, BAMBOOZLED!

Not just the top one hundred of devils may cry, I’m also high up on the leaderboards of Batman and assassins creed brotherhood I just got to number 18 in the world, I think my player experience justifies my opinion on what makes a good game..also I was learning how to make games before anyone else was interested in the subject, you know... Back before you even left school..I know Unreal Engine like the back of my hand, I can model in zbrush, model in max, I can rig and animate in max. I can do textures in substance painter and photoshop. I can program in five fucking languages. I’m basically a digital fucking god cause I can create anything I can imagine...and you think your shitty four years of being badly taught ( seeing as you don’t know what motion blur is, or animation blending) matters a fuck to me?

Ok so as a heavy hitter in the electronic music scene i have to wade in here and share my opinion! In case anyone doubts my credentials i was the inspiration for the aphex twin albums '26 burts for cash' and the famous ep 'come to jimmy' I also influenced many other artists, but this comment isn't about me and my successes. As a HIGHLY successful youtuber i thumbs DOWN this video! and im going to tell you why? The problem here is that hiphoptano is out of his element when it comes to electronic music. This album doesnt have gangsters rapping about skool playground violence and raiding a mcdonalds for chicken nuggets, so anthony doesnt know how to approach this album. As a key member in the progression of the electronic music scene i can safely say this album has plenty of creativity on display. This artist is going places and i bet my yolo cap that his next album will be dope. THINK about it!﻿

I THINK I get why you were downvoted. Questioning the natural laws of reddit. Somewhere inbetween breaking the 4th wall and telling Truman it's a show.

I got nailed for criticising how a "grilled cheese" was named the other day, but you deserve yours.



$------------------$



Why are you so over-critical of a post? I swear, this has to be one of the most annoying trends nowadays. I am actually enraged by what goes through that brain of yours. This comment is truly a disgrace to humanity. Yeah, instead of appreciating the humor of a post (which is the sub is intended for, I already reported you to the moderators), you choose to get in the way of your own enjoyment and criticize OP. How do you think OP feels right now? Well, you probably would not know, because you seem to lack self-awareness, but I will tell you this: If you continue your rude ways, no one will ever like you. You have been warned. For this comment, I will award you a downvote.

Credit to someone else in /r/funny, if they want credit I'll put username but I think they meant it seriously and unironically, and out of respect I don't want to get the OP hounded.

You see the beautiful face with the orange parka. You see the pain in his haunting eyes. As you stare into his hollow soul, you begin to tear up. “OH MY GOD! HE KILLED KENNY!” You hear the boy with the green hat shriek. “YOU BASTARD!” You hear the one with the blue hat say. You look at the fat kid with the red jacket. He’s eating his cheesy poofs, staring blankly at the carcass. He isn’t fazed at all. You take off the hood of the parka and see his deformed face. My god, it’s hideous!
As you stare at the corpse with hollow eyes, you begin sobbing uncontrollably. What have you done, you monster.

I heard some kid today repeating these words, “Gucci Gang Gucci Gang.” What does this mean. Was he trying to summon the devil. Was it an enchantment meant to curse me. I MEAN HE JUST KEPT REPEATING THEM!!! As if to scare me! I wouldn’t be surprised if this has to do with some ancient South African ritual where they summon the god of Gucci. They believe that Gucci is a way of life a way of giving life meaning “to be dope” as they would say. I just can’t understand why a nice suburban kid from my area would do this!? I am planning on calling an online psychic to “de-Gucci” me... please pray for me and my family in this time of need.

I have never heard such vile words come out of a person's mouth. I was shocked that my own flesh and blood could ever say that about Young Sheldon, a show that's represents the peak of human evolution. I would have beaten him, but I knew I was just too late to teach him the ways of bazinga. I thought since he was my child, it would be encoded into D.N.A to love the Big Bang Theory. I'm sorry,  I'm getting emotional typing this. God cried when he watched the Big Bang Theory  and asked for another show, Young Sheldon was his answer. I didn't want my son to be the bane of my existence and of his own existence. So I'm currently leading him to my cabin in the woods. There, I will give him eternal peace. Being a single mom can be tough sometimes! XD

I'm 13 years old and i just started playing mount and blade and i can say to you that this is my fovourite game!!! This moment when i fought with the sea riders first time!! I was amazing. I am smarter than you, kids with fidget spinners xD. Maybe i am young but i am smarter than all non-m&b players on earth!
Anyway this game is very deep, like in this moment when Rhodoks declared war on Swadia and Harlus organized a feast. He must had balls to do this.
I was recently with my mum in Mcdonald and I asked seller for a butter and this fat bitch did not even understand what i'm talking about, stupid bitch. Once time on a lesson I shouted ,,I WILL DRINK FROM YOU SKULL'' xD and this stupid bitch mr. Zdeb tolded me to get out from the class. I hate her, I hate school!. Harlus was right, school is for stupid people and I'm to smart for these imbeciles. I love mount and blade and I'm enough smart to understand it.

Has anyone else been as disappointed in Ahegao IRL japanese porn? You can tell the women are just putting all their energy into trying to copy that expression and aren't feeling the overwhelming sexual pleasure it is supposed to be a reflection of.

Cartoons are supposed to be a stylization of real life, when real life tries to copy that stylization it usually ends up in the uncanny valley. I'd much rather watch porn where the women were instructed to make over the top expressions of pleasure but still try to be natural with them, maybe intersperse manga hentai pages drawn of them fucking with the classic Ahegao expressions to highlight the stylization aspect.

To be fa⍰r, you have to have a very h⍰gh IQ to understand R⍰ck and Morty. The humor ⍰s extremely subtle, and w⍰thout a sol⍰d grasp of theoret⍰cal phys⍰cs most of the jokes w⍰ll go over a typ⍰cal v⍰ewer's head. There's also R⍰ck's n⍰h⍰l⍰st⍰c outlook, wh⍰ch ⍰s deftly woven ⍰nto h⍰s character⍰sat⍰on - h⍰s personal ph⍰losophy draws heav⍰ly from Narodnaya Volya l⍰terature, for ⍰nstance. The fans understand th⍰s stuff; they have the ⍰ntellectual capac⍰ty to truly apprec⍰ate the depths of these jokes, to real⍰ze that they're not just funny- they say someth⍰ng deep about LIFE. As a consequence people who d⍰sl⍰ke R⍰ck and Morty truly ARE ⍰d⍰ots- of course they wouldn't apprec⍰ate, for ⍰nstance, the humour ⍰n R⍰ck's ex⍰stenc⍰al catchphrase "Wubba Lubba Dub Dub," wh⍰ch ⍰tself ⍰s a crypt⍰c reference to Turgenev's Russ⍰an ep⍰c Fathers and Sons I'm sm⍰rk⍰ng r⍰ght now just ⍰mag⍰n⍰ng one of those addlepated s⍰mpletons scratch⍰ng the⍰r heads ⍰n confus⍰on as Dan Harmon's gen⍰us unfolds ⍰tself on the⍰r telev⍰s⍰on screens.

The way that Reddit promotes incest and abuse of women is disgusting.

See, this is why I’ve always said that SJWs are a blessing, as they reveal the TRUTH about how crooked we are as human beings, especially straight white conservative men (a.k.a. the literal reincarnation of Satan). Reddit is such a sexist website, and it's only proven by disgusting comments like yours.

Reddit's utter insensitivity just baffles me sometimes. For a self-proclaimed "progressive website," you really don't give precedence to any situation outside of your own little cushioned bubble do ya? Well, it's lucky that life hasn't fucked you balls deep in the ass just yet, my friend.

But just watch - once you hit upon on hard times, DON'T YOU COME CRYIN' TO ME! I ain't gonna to be there to wipe your tears off. I ain't gonna be there to wipe the drool off your face. I ain't gonna be there to feed your starved little soul.

No, no.

It'll be all on you. ALL on you. You'll learn how, when life gets you down, it pulls you down. Let's see just how easily you can get out of that and come out sober, mentally healthy, physically healthy, and completely sanitized and innocent!

May the Almighty Lord and Saviour Jesus H.W. Allah Christ, Sr. spare your rotten soul with His Graciousness and Kindness. I shall pray for you. 👏

Bless. 🙏

I cannot think or comprehend of anything more cucked than having a daughter. Honestly, think about it rationally. You are feeding, clothing, raising and rearing a girl for at least 18 years solely so she can go and get ravaged by another man. All the hard work you put into your beautiful little girl - reading her stories at bedtime, making her go to sports practice, making sure she had a healthy diet, educating her, playing with her. All of it has one simple result: her body is more enjoyable for the men that will eventually fuck her in every hole.
Raised the perfect girl? Great. Who benefits? If you're lucky, a random man who had nothing to do with the way she grew up, who marries her. He gets to fuck her tight pussy every night. He gets the benefits of her kind and sweet personality that came from the way you raised her.
As a man who has a daughter, you are LITERALLY dedicating at least 20 years of your life simply to raise a girl for another man to enjoy. It is the ULTIMATE AND FINAL cuck. Think about it logically.

Look, I'm not a hateful person or anything – I believe we should all live and let live. But lately, I've been having a real problem with these little girls. You see, just about wherever I go these days, one of them approaches me and starts sucking my cock.

Take last Sunday, for instance, when I casually struck up a conversation with this girl in the daycare center. Nothing weird, just a man and a little girl talking about her favorite toys while she's coloring. The girl looked like a real cutie, tiny shoulders, innocent smile, pink hair clips. She didn't seem the least bit teleiophilic. At least not until she started sucking my cock, that is.

Where does this loli get the nerve to suck my cock? Did I look pedophilic to her? Did I have a beard, moustache and glasses without realizing it? I don't recall the phrase, "Suck my cock" entering the conversation, and I don't have a sign around my neck that reads, "Please, Lolis, Suck My Cock."

I've got nothing against little girls. Let them be free to do their teleio thing in peace, I say. But when they start sucking my cock, then I've got a real problem.

Then there was the time I was hiking through the woods and came across a healthy-looking, blond-haired little girl in her early preteens. She seemed normal enough to me while we were bathing in that mountain stream, but, before you know it, she's sucking my cock!

What is it with these little girls? Can't they control their sexual urges? Aren't there enough pedo cocks out there for them to suck on without them having to target normal people like me?

Believe me, I have no interest in getting my cock sucked by some little girl. But try telling that to the girl at the beach. Or the one at the video store. Or the one who sold me lemonade. Or any of the countless other teleios who've come on to me recently. All of them sucked my cock, and there was nothing I could do to stop them.

I tell you, when a little girl is sucking your cock, a lot of strange thoughts go through your head: How the hell did this happen? Where did this little girl ever get the idea that I was pedo? And why does she have such adorable shoes?

It screws with your head at other times, too. Every time a little girl passes me on the street, I'm afraid she's going to grab me and drag me off to some bathroom to suck my cock. I've even started to visualize these repulsive cock-sucking episodes during the healthy marital relations I enjoy with my wife – even some that haven't actually happened.

Things could be worse, I suppose. It could be women trying to suck my cock, which would be adultery and would make me feel tremendously guilty. As it is, I'm just angry and sickened. But believe me, that's enough. I don't know what makes these little girls mistake me for a guy who wants his cock sucked, and, frankly, I don't want to know. I just wish there were some way to get them to stop.

I've tried all sorts of things to get them to stop, but it has all been to no avail. A few months back, I started driving in a white van with tinted windows in the hopes that it would frighten those little girls off, but it didn't work. In fact, it only seemed to encourage them. Then, I really started getting rough, slapping them around whenever they were sucking my cock, but that failed, too. Even pulling out of their mouths just before ejaculation and shooting sperm all over their face, neck, chest and hair seemed to have no effect. What do I have to do to get the message across to these midgets?

I swear, if these little girls don't take a hint and quit sucking my cock all the time, I'm going to have to resort to drastic measures – like maybe pinning them down to the cement floor of the playground with my powerful forearms and working my cock all the way up their butt so they understand loud and clear just how much I disapprove of their unwelcome advances. I mean, you can't get much more direct than that.

If you cut welfare and kill everyone poorer than you it would make you poor. Similarly, if you kill everyone blacker than you it would make you black. This is why I'm in favour of the regularcide so I can finally achieve my dream of becoming a black man.

Can you please not use curse words (such as fl**t)? There are children in this website.
You leftist and liberal users should, of all people, understand that some of your fellow users, children, should not be exposed to bad words at such a tender age, as it may trigger them to pursue bad thoughts and actions.
Thank you for understanding.

Okay, so you expect me to believe that you were the very best that your generation of Navy SEALs had to offer? I highly doubt that. If you were as good as you say you were, I don't think for a second that you would be browsing Reddit. This is mostly a place for jobless neckbeards that still live with their parents, and nerdy high school kids that don't have any friends. It really isn't the place for highly-trained assassins to be hanging out in their spare time. Even if it was, something far worse than a troll being mean to you probably would have set you off a long time ago. What about the slew of gore that gets posted here on a regular basis? Isn't that something that deserves a person being hunted down and made to regret their actions? Yeah, you're just not the reddit type. Sure, there's a wide variety of people that browse here, but you're far from the core demographic if you are who you say you are (which isn't the case). Even if it were true that you're an incredibly talented soldier, I think all the military discipline would prevent you from getting mad enough to murder some random idiot on the internet. I also doubt that even the best SEALs have a "secret network of spies across the USA". Why would all of the most expanisive Big Brother network in the world be willing to help a troubled PTSD-sufferer hunt down some random kid on the internet? That doesn't even make sense. If you're gonna try to scare somebody, make it more believable than "IM A SUPER SOLDIER HURR DURR". You might frighten a thirteen year old who doesn't know any better, but to most of us you just look like a kid with an anger problem and a very active imagination. Hopefully things will be easier for you when your puberty's over. Best of luck with that... kiddo.

I’ve only been watching porn for a year or two now, and I’m a 21-year-old straight female. The first porn I watched of her was some passionate one with this guy, and after that I’ve watched various lesbian porn, but there were always these scenes of a brunette with a tattoo on her shoulder blade, or if I just saw a brunette who caught my eye, I would get so aroused and close to having an orgasm.

Today I did a google search trying to find out who that brunette with the tattoo on her shoulder is, and I found that her name is Dani Daniels. I watched a compilation of her tribbing scenes and literally all of the ones I was so aroused by turned out to be the ones that she was in. 

I guess I’m bisexual for Dani Daniels? I’ve literally never thought about nor been attracted to a female before, but there’s something about her that makes me nuts.

Ok, is this a video game reference? I've never really been into video games, so can you please explain what you're saying here? Is this like some type of weird life-simulating-game social thing you're acting out with your fellow video gamers here? I mean, I like books, personally (you know, where things that are mentioned actually have an impact on how the story progresses (that's a sign of intelligence on the part of the author because it demonstrates cohesive, forward thinking (and on the reader's behalf if they can figure out these patterns as well (but I suppose it may not be as common with gamers if they're not used to having some plot point or event, etc., progressing the story (but then I can't blame them for their ignorance if they don't have the exposure (I'm pretty fair about this)))))). So can you please explain this? Sorry if this seems intrusive or condescending; I certainly don't mean it that way: I'm just trying to provide my own perspective and understand yours. People always downplot me without answering my actual question. Thank you in advance.

I've been thinking, and you know what we need? Another Holocaust against those filthy weeaboos. It would solve all of our problems. It would remove all of those filthy pedophiles in the anime "community"  and cleanse humanity of it's darkest sin once and for all. It's all because of those damn Japanese. They never forgave for nuking them so they made anime to cripple our sexuality. I think it's about time we pay them back. Checkmate Japan!

You guys are just plain stupid. The fact that you're still hating against Hitler makes you a pathetic human being. He was a great leader to his followers, and yes, he maybe made one small mistake. So what? If the russians wouldn't have been lucky with their climatic situation, Hitler would've led his Reich to glory. Everyone makes mistakes. You guys are just jealous haters, trapped in this new 'memeing' society, where everything is a joke to you. But not on my watch. Not if it's about Hitler. Seriously, get a grip guys. Geez.

I chatted with a female at the grocery store today. God there was so much sexual tension. We were in the express lane and the cashier was taking forever, so she was getting noticeably irritated, i was behind her in line and she looked back at me a couple times (she was def checking out my sweet outfit and over all attrictiveness) after a couple minutes (of holding a 40 pound bag of cat food on my shoulder, showcasing my strength) she looked back at me and let out a sigh. I immediately took the chance to break the ice and say "so much for express lame am i right?" 
To which she giggled at my superior humor and conversation skills. I had two items (cat food and a large hunk of salmon) and she offered to let me go in front of her in line, to which i respectfully denied the offer. God there was so much sexual tension.

**The Man** breaks up your day, and doesn't give you set hours of work, therefore not allowing you to make any long term scheduled plans, because you might have a day shift on that day, so you can't make it, meantime they are working from home and you know that means getting up at noon and doing a whole heap of blow, then taking your job and making it twice as unpredictable until you just say "fuck it I can't work this job no more man, you're killing me" and they are like, "that's cool, we'll just get some school leaver to take your job, less pay, more spirit, and that means more blow for everyone" except you don't get any blow, and god damn you know you would be the one who needs it because you got so much work to do, and it just keeps coming and coming and coming and you're like "WTF" and **The Man** and then something something conspiracy 7/11 was a part time job frak deez nuts and move to Canada because we got the bomb and they got the oil but then they also have hummus and we've got the crackers, but no crack and that's the problem, because now you've got more work to do after you wasted your time reading this, and it's all like, "dude, wtf was that" and I'm like, "fucked if I know, geez, I'm looking at the same thing you are" and you're like "but you wrote it" and I'm like, "did I?" in a mysterious voice, then you're like "yes, jesus, it has your name at the top" and I'm like, "oh yeah" and then I stopped typing

It was a hot summer day and I was in my workout room benching 1200 pounds. My abs were flexing and girls within a 10 mile radius were getting wet. Once I was done with my daily 32 hour workout I called one of the bitches I know, Jessica. She is really damn hot and looks like a supermodel. SO I got into my Lamborghini Gallardo and reved it up to 40,000 RPM (this is an Italian import with special engine system). I got onto the freeway near my house and threw it into 8th gear, I hit about 600 mph and I could hear the sonic boom as I broke the sound barrier. As I was flooring it on the freeway like a badass, Jessica called me and said she wanted me to **** her. So be it.
I came to a full stop from 700 mph in front of her house. These Ferraris have top notch brakes, you know. So she gets out of the house and walks up to my Bugatti and starts eyeballing my dick. I could tell she was staring at it because when I looked at her I noticed she was looking at my dick. Booya.

Flash forward 10 minutes later. My 30 inch dick is going inside of her VAGINA, hitting them walls. I'm holding her entire body up with my left pinky as I'm ****ing her and she has 30,000 orgasms. She looks me in the eyes and she says "harder." V-TEC just kicked in, yo. I blow my load so hard she falls off my dick. There had to have been about two pints of cum everywhere. People say I cum like a pornstar, I wouldn't disagree with them.

I throw her a towel so she can clean herself up then I do a triple backflip into my Maserati and drive home

first of all I am not an incel. I literally went on a date a week ago, so I’m not incel. Second, you don’t even know that there are different extremities of incels. I want an egalitarian world, not a gynocentric world. Third, there is a common misconception that all incels want is sex. Yet I am not even ready for sex. Fourth, don’t assume someone’s ideologies based on one thing they said. Just because you can’t handle the truth doesn’t mean you should go out and say “I’m wrong” without validly proving your point. I was mainly going off of science, and apparently most people in the world don’t agree with science if it doesn’t fit their ideologies, even if science is true. That is like even if Trump appeals to you and you agree with his viewpoints on issues, you still vote Clinton because you call yourself a Democrat. So if you could kindly educate yourself a lot more about Incels, TRP,  and other related topics before you say stuff, I would  appreciate it. But as I know of how stubborn you are, you won’t even consider looking deeply into topics and act like you know so much about them. This is what separates people like you and people like me. I look at both sides of every argument, and choose the one that is most rational, not go off of what other people say is “cool”. I rationally choose what I think is best for myself, my family, my community and my country. If you would like to know more about what I believe in, ask me (I know you won’t and you would still make stupid assumptions about me that aren’t true) in what I believe is right or wrong and not just say random shit that doesn’t align with my ideologies. Ya so please stop saying shit about me that isn’t true.

Imagine a plump tuba gentleman waddling up to you making low groans starving. He begins to suck you into his large flared bell acting as a giant maw to stuff you inside of as you easily slide down into his wet brass innards.

Being sucked in deeper into darkness ending up as a big fat lump in his gut cramped far inside him. Satisfied with such a meal he begins to puff away an upbeat ditty with you tightly curled inside of his bloated brass belly as the incredibly low bass notes rumble around you vibrating you to the tune as his hot wet breath blows over you in a thick gust. An intense sensory trip makes you feel one with his music providing him with many low tuba belches of satisfaction.

Your clothes are blown clean off your body and lifted out the top of the stuffed tuba as he keeps puffing away with you inside of his belly. Those long low tones rumbling out of him in ecstasy taking great joy in you filling his gut and vibrating inside as he plays. You can feel those warm brass tubes coated in spit buzz with such an intensity around your nude body that the bass notes make you tremble with immense pleasure feeling the sound resonate through your body and stimulating you from all your senses being tickled and buzzed.

This is crack. Rock cocaine. It isn't glamorous, or cool, or kid stuff. It's the most addictive type of cocaine, and it can kill you. What's really bad is that no one knows how much it takes, so every time you use, it you risk dying. It isnt worth it. Look, everyone wants to be cool, but doing it with crack isn't just wrong, it's dead wrong.

Don't even try it.

The thrill can kill.

You see, Rick and Morty isn't a show. Well, the show is the physical incarnation of it, but it is actually more of a state of mind. People like Albert Einstein, Nikola Tesla, and other incredible scientists were in this state of mind when they did their best works. We have found multiple sketches of Rick and Morty characters inside of the apartments and laboratories of these geniuses around the world, suggesting that they were fans of the show long before it even began.
Until the creation of the Television, this concept of Rick and Morty was forever stuck in the minds of the super-intelligent, until Dan Harmon was finally able to form it into something more tangible- something that can be perceived by an average mind. 
TL;DR: Rick and Morty has always been a spiritual concept which has kept science moving forward for generations, and is just now becoming comprehendible to the "normies."

I have this theory that the people who deny traps being gay the most are actually homophobic due to their nonacceptance of the status of "gay" being applied to them. I mean, if you like a dude that's fine, but stop telling me that it's not gay, it's more gay to deny being gay while your waifu is, on all biological accounts, a dude.

Oh, and you contributed a productive, relevant response to actually help find this guy? You think this guy hasn’t thought of this? Nope. You contributed an empty comment. A total little karma-grab you have here, don't ya? How utterly pointless.

Seriously, what is wrong with you people? Do you make these comments just for karma grabs? Do you get some type of pride out of saying absolutely empty comments? I swear, sometimes I really just don't get people. I've thought about whether it's just me, but frankly, when all I see around me is nonsense, it gets to a point where I just have to question whether I'm the one who's insane or whether people just do things I can't get.

Ok, whatever. As long as you're not harming anyone, it can be forgiven. I forgive you. Cheers mate.

# FOLDING@HOME

**What is it?**

Folding@Home is a project by the Stanford University that uses our computing power to help study the process of protein folding so as to aid research on various diseases, including many forms of **cancer, Alzheimer's, Huntington's, and Parkinson's**.  It is basically a big distributed supercomputer, and you can contribute a node!


## What do I have to do to help out?

All you have to do is install a small program on your computer or android phone and it downloads a small amount of data that it analyses.  When finished it then returns the results to the Stanford researchers and collects another task. You can even [choose what disease research to base the bulk of your computing power on](http://i.imgur.com/uID425t.jpg) or just let it fold them all! 

## I don't have quad Xeons and 8 Titan XPs and 14 RX Vegas. Can I really do anything?

Everyone, no matter the hardware they possess, has a chance to help researchers fighting cancer and other illnesses, and, perhaps, make a big difference in the life of other people. Here it is [running on a Pentium 4](http://i.imgur.com/KsspmGFg.png). While a modern CPU and GPU will be tenfold faster at folding every little bit can help! It's effectively making it so scientists get faster access to information! [Here's an i5-6500/GTX 970](http://i.imgur.com/B2ZAZkV.png)

[Overclock.net has a good resource for benchmarks of various GPUs.](http://www.overclock.net/t/475163/gpu-projects-ppd-database)

## Joining is easy and takes about 3 minutes!

1. Visit [this link](http://folding.stanford.edu/start-folding/) and click where it says **DOWNLOAD** under step 1. 

2. Install the software and everything is very self-explanatory.[(Windows)](http://folding.stanford.edu/support/faq/installation-guides/windows/) | [(Linux)](http://folding.stanford.edu/support/faq/installation-guides/linux/) | [(Mac)](http://folding.stanford.edu/support/faq/installation-guides/mac/)

3. That's it!

You can choose any username you want, even if it's already taken, and select to be part of a team to 'compete' against other teams to see who can accomplish the most science.  [Our team number is 225605](http://i.imgur.com/fbIiZCn.png) but you do not have to join ours. Regardless of which team you join (or even if you don't join any) you are still helping!

In the [initial config screen](http://i.imgur.com/fbIiZCn.png), you can also have a [passkey](http://folding.stanford.edu/support/faq/points/passkey/) e-mailed to you by Stanford University. This is a string that you can add when you set up Folding@Home and that will give you extra folding points, under some criteria, if you finish your work units before scheduled!  For higher end hardware this is very common.  [Folding@Home benchmarks their tasks on an older first generation i5.](http://folding.stanford.edu/support/faq/points/#how-is-the-qrb-determined)  This is your target to beat.

## But doesn't this make my computer run very hot?

It is designed to run your system as hard as it can to get the fastest returns on results, so yes it can make your computer run hot.  However, you have control as to when it runs and how quickly you want it to run.  Your options are Light, Medium or Full.

* **Light:** CPU is Folding at half speed and the GPU is not Folding at all.
* **Medium:** CPU is Folding at three-quarter speed.  GPU Folding is enabled and at full speed.  Medium is selected by default.
* **High:** CPU is Folding at full blast and so is the GPU.  This will consume the most power and generate the most heat.

You can also control whether or not you want to Fold while you're doing other things.

* While I'm working: Folding is enabled (as above) at all times.
* Only when idle: Starts folding when you leave the machine for a couple minutes.

Many people also find that running it at medium or even high makes no difference on what concerns performance if you're only just browsing the internet.

If those options aren't enough and you want some further control, you have options.

* Programs like [TThrottle](http://efmer.com/b/) can suspend and resume Folding based on the CPU / GPU temperature.  F@H already does this, but only at extreme temperatures.
* F@H can be configured so it only uses a number of CPU cores you specify
* Programs like MSI Afterburner can make sure your GPU will never go past a certain temperature when folding.

If, instead, you are going for MAX/FULL power folding, then know that Folding@home is designed to max your parts even more than video games or benchmarks!  This means your temperatures will be higher than normal so you will want to check what they reach and/or tweak your CPU/GPU fan curves so they run at a higher speed. Your CPU and GPU *are* designed for this.

As always, you're the one who knows best what you're trying to achieve, but know that having this software startup at boot and running on low at all times will usually have little effect on performance/temperatures.

Consider running a monitoring program alongside when folding at a constant FULL level. Some program recommendations are [OCCT](http://www.ocbase.com/index.php/software/20-occt), [MSI's Afterburner](http://event.msi.com/vga/afterburner/download.htm) or other similar programs. 

## THE PCMR TEAM

[Team "Official PCMR"](http://fah-web.stanford.edu/cgi-bin/main.py?qtype=teampage&teamnum=225605) (225605) has the potential to be one of the top 15 teams in the world. Here are our [glorious folders](http://folding.extremeoverclocking.com/user_list.php?s=&t=225605)!  Right now we are ranked [**22nd(!!!^(!!!))** in the world](http://folding.extremeoverclocking.com/team_list.php?s=&t=225605#225605) and rising quickly.

Im making the switch from ps4 to console. Most of my friends have Pcs and they all have been telling me for the longest time about the whole pc is better than console thing. I did some research and i had about a 500$ budget for the WHOLE setup, like including monitor, headset and mouse+keyboard. I then realized thats too little, so i think 900$ is my maximum. Ik this is a vague question but will 900$ get me a good/ decent PC, a monitor+headset+keyboard+mouse and maybe even a small desk? Thanks

So, throughout the year i have been building my new PC. ryzen 7 1700 @ 4ghz, 16gb 3k ram, GTX1050 and S340 elite.

looks beautiful, my 1440p korean monitor @ 100hz fits it well.

However all year i have felt bad since i cheaped out on the GPU as i was waiting for vega, that came and disappointed me. Anyway the other day i had $600 AUD to spend on a GPU (which is a used GTX 1080). i got the deal of a lifetime when someone offered me an ex-review 1080ti for $600 + my 1050. 

So there i was last night, after a solid gaming session i was about to go to bed, right before i turned off my PC i just looked at it, proper checkin it out that new GPU and all my red lighting, knowing i had something special right there and we had an amazing bond. It was the feeling that someone would get from sitting in their freshly purchased ferrari that they spent their whole life trying to buy.

then i turn around and see my wife looking at me with the weirdest eyes gettin, it was like a death stare mixed with rolling her eyes then laughed and called me a nerd.

she understood, not many people would! i actually left the 1080ti box on the other side of my PC and i look at it about 20 times a day thinking wow this is mine.

I'm checkin her out 20 times a day whilst i game, so happy i got the S340 elite, can stare at that baby all day!

I just picked up a barebones kit for 200 dollars and am not quite sure what my best option for egpu is. Is the nuc going to bottleneck the aorus 1080 box or am I better off going for the 1070? I ordered 2x 16g ddr4 ram sticks and a 500gb m.2 so far. This is going to basically be an htpc that emulates older systems and streams movies while still being able to squeeze the most out of bigger newer titles and maybe (it’s a pretty big stretch) even occasionally use it for work. Any input is much appreciated thanks.

I’m stumped,
I’m trying to upgrade from 7 to 10 but it keeps getting stuck at the black screen with the white dots I’ve unplugged everything n that hasn’t fixed it.
I’ve now uninstalled my graphics driver n got it upgrading again.


Any advice?

It is in alpha right now but most of the functionality is there.

It's a site dedicated to calling out pubishers / devs on crappy consumer practices. Ie. Loot boxes, must be online to save single player campaign, requiring DLC to see the true ending of a game, microtransactions for cheat codes ect...

It's not a gameplay review site, so that isn't included in the score, games are ranked on a shit scale of 1-10 (10 being the worst)

Looking for you submissions and thoughts in general, can also submit via the site if you like

My friend says that pc master race is just a bunch of people that say big words to try to seem smart. What do you think?

Hello, me and my girlfriend are looking for a coop game to play together. She doesn't have much space on her harddrive, so it would be great if it was under 5 gigs. We are looking at Spiral Knights at the moment. Please leave suggestions!

Around a year ago I wanted to refund one of the games I bought and it also required me to go through live chat. After waiting for 20 minutes on chrome, I opened up Internet Explorer and after a minute of waiting I was talking with someone. 

tl;dr use a shitty browser to talk with a shitty company

This Star Wars bullshit is overshading the fact, that Take-Two is doing way more aggressive microtransactions. GTA Online stuff is so heavily inflated, to afford something, you would need to pay 60€ for a single thing, while for that money you can buy a new game. Also they're releasing a major update, and dripfeeding the rest of the content for months to come. And every game published by Take-Two will have microtransactions. They basically ruined every new game that was or will be announced and released at one point. AND don't make me remind me how they cracked down on the modding community.

So before boycotting EA over this Star Wars shenanigans, don't forget to boycott Take-Two

Hello Guys!

I recently bought a Razer Blade (6700HQ, 1060) And Since I've been a desktop only guy for the past year and a console peasant before that. I haven't had a Laptop since I was 8, wanted to ask people who use laptops to game 2 things.

1. Is it true that you get significantly less performance when you're not plugged into the wall?

2. How do I extend my laptop's lifespan?

3. Do Battery optimizers work?

EDIT: why do i get downvoted ;-; i just wanted help

(text copied from http://www.clickerheroes2.com/paytowin.php)

We had to choose one of two models: Paid upfront like traditional games, or free-to-play with a real-money shop like Clicker Heroes 1. We chose paid upfront, for $29.99 (fully refundable for a year after launch), and we are in a situation where we have to explain ourselves to a massive number of players who were expecting/hoping for a free sequel. There are several reasons why we are making this decision.

**Ethical reasons**

Games are inherently addictive. That alone is not a bad thing, until it gets abused. In Clicker Heroes 1, we never tried to abuse players with our real-money shop, and for the most part we designed it without the shop in mind so that you never have to purchase rubies to progress. Despite this, we found that some number of players spent many thousands of dollars on rubies. I can only hope that these people could afford it, and that they were doing it to support us, and not to feed an addiction. But I strongly suspect that this is not the case.

We made a lot of money from these players who spent thousands. They are known to the industry as "Whales". Great. If you're rich, please be my guest. But we don't want this kind of money if it came from anyone who regrets their decision, if it made their lives significantly worse as a result. Unfortunately, those who have a problem are usually in denial about it, and would be too ashamed to ask us for a refund. We would give the refund in a heartbeat. It's not like we have artists drawing each ruby by hand. It costs us nothing but payment processing fees.

We really don't like making money off players who are in denial of their addiction. And that's what a large part of free-to-play gaming is all about. Everyone in the industry seems to rationalize it by shifting the blame, assuming way too much cognizance on the part of their victims. People can make their own decisions, right? But it just doesn't sit well with me. Despite very few of our players having complained, it felt wrong when we started doing it and it still feels wrong now.

That said, we're not going to change how we monetize Clicker Heroes 1. It would destroy our studio if we did. Most people are OK with how we've handled it. Our unlimited refund policy still stands. But going forward we're going to at least try the paid-up-front model for our business. It may or may not work. It probably isn't worth nearly as much money, but at least we can do it with a cleaner conscience.

**Game design reasons**

We want the experience to be good. The mere existence of real-money purchases puts an ugly cloud over the player's experience, with the persistent nagging feeling of "My game could be so much better if I just spent a few dollars". That alone feels terrible.

Also, if we have a real-money shop, we are limited to only rebalancing the game in ways that people who just spent money would approve of. People paid real money to get the current state of their game where it is at, and they've developed an expectation that it would be good for a long time. If we make changes to the game that are better for the game but *feel* worse for any one particular player at any stage of the game, we get backlash from that player. We've experienced this many times in the past. As a result, Clicker Heroes 1 is kind of a frankenstein of a game, our hands always having been tied by the fact that we couldn't easily change things that people paid for.

With Clicker Heroes 2, we plan to work on at least a few major updates without too much regard to player progress, similar to the way Dwarf Fortress, Rimworld, Factorio, and other games do. New updates can change the game to be incompatible with old saves (which will be rare, maybe once or twice a year), and there will be plenty of advance warning when it happens. Players then have the option to continue playing on the old version, or start fresh on the new version. To help make things more interesting, Clicker Heroes 2 is designed with multiple characters for you to choose from. So when you start fresh on one of these updates, you can play a different character, which will be a much different experience.

Also, we like games with mods and we want mods. Real-money shops make little sense with mods, when you can just download a mod to quadruple the number of rubies you get. Also, it is simply too easy to cheat. To facilitate modding, we would be giving lots of easy access to the source code, and very easy save editing.

**Pre-orders**

Final reason: Pre-orders don't make sense if a game is free-to-play. Pre-orders qualify for full refunds for up to a year after we launch. You can pre-order now: https://www.clickerheroes2.com/.

I just wanted to write a post thanking this subreddit and HyperX on their great headset and amazing cs, since it was in this subreddit that I first read about them and got convinced to snatch a pair of Cloud II's. A few days ago my headset stopped working (one of the earpieces wouldn't reproduce any noise) and after contacting HyperX they immediately recognised the issue and sent a new pair which arrived in express delivery to my new address. The lack of hassle with the costumer service and the quick response were a pleasant surprise (after having other poor experiences with other gaming equipment providers, ahem Razer...) and have definitely made me a really happy costumer. So a big thanks to all the community members that have recommended this product and brand, they've definitely worked great for me and I'll be sure to favour them for any future purchases. Keep being the helpful and friendly community you are!
